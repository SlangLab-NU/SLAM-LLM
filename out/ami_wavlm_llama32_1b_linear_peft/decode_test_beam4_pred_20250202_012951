Baycrest12308a_762.697_2.87.wav_ASR	the target was called by the line
Baycrest12308a_773.82_1.0.wav_ASR	then
Baycrest12308a_776.86_0.78.wav_ASR	yeah
Baycrest12308a_788.28_1.25.wav_ASR	the bad
Baycrest12308a_789.761_0.42.wav_ASR	yeah
fridriksson07a_7.195_0.35.wav_ASR	okay
fridriksson07a_12.858_2.12.wav_ASR	yeah i think it's a lot better
fridriksson07a_16.931_3.91.wav_ASR	because i before i used to search for words
fridriksson07a_21.898_1.66.wav_ASR	lot of times i couldn't find them
fridriksson07a_23.926_4.6.wav_ASR	but now if i think a minute then i can get up a button
fridriksson07a_31.164_0.69.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
fridriksson07a_41.962_3.81.wav_ASR	oh you know it it was it comes kind
fridriksson07a_46.406_2.5.wav_ASR	little bit i can remember
fridriksson07a_49.365_4.87.wav_ASR	but we were on we were down on uh j we lit in textures at the time
fridriksson07a_54.53_1.15.wav_ASR	and we were in germany
fridriksson07a_55.7_2.71.wav_ASR	and we had been there for s six weeks
fridriksson07a_58.659_4.07.wav_ASR	because my daughter was flying all over the country looking for a job
fridriksson07a_63.161_2.6.wav_ASR	so so we were on our way back
fridriksson07a_66.298_2.13.wav_ASR	and we stopped at a remote
fridriksson07a_69.425_1.08.wav_ASR	and i said to my husband
fridriksson07a_70.687_1.25.wav_ASR	don't feel very well
fridriksson07a_71.96_0.39.wav_ASR	oh
fridriksson07a_72.494_1.99.wav_ASR	maybe i gotta eat or something
fridriksson07a_74.55_5.75.wav_ASR	so then the the lady gave me the key to put in the door and i kept dropping it
fridriksson07a_80.536_3.17.wav_ASR	didn't i go down and i couldn't pick it up
fridriksson07a_85.175_3.87.wav_ASR	and so she had to come out by the end of the quarter and she picked it up for me
fridriksson07a_89.612_2.87.wav_ASR	but i went back to the door and i still couldn't do it
fridriksson07a_92.88_1.18.wav_ASR	yeah this is your right hand
fridriksson07a_95.975_3.19.wav_ASR	and so then my husband says
fridriksson07a_100.237_4.02.wav_ASR	obviously to check in because my wife is having problems
fridriksson07a_104.458_2.84.wav_ASR	uh i think she's the digitix so i think she
fridriksson07a_107.516_7.12.wav_ASR	so sh he gives me you know um pat which i never drink
fridriksson07a_115.89_1.79.wav_ASR	and then he you know so he's
fridriksson07a_117.874_0.86.wav_ASR	take your sugar
fridriksson07a_119.121_0.79.wav_ASR	so i told him
fridriksson07a_120.03_0.94.wav_ASR	looked in my purse
fridriksson07a_121.4_0.62.wav_ASR	oh hang on
fridriksson07a_122.301_0.79.wav_ASR	okay
fridriksson07a_123.114_1.2.wav_ASR	you can i couldn't find it
fridriksson07a_125.166_3.979.wav_ASR	and then he said for the first time i got really angry
fridriksson07a_129.196_2.33.wav_ASR	and i never f lose my temper
fridriksson07a_132.305_0.33.wav_ASR	mass
fridriksson07a_132.756_1.36.wav_ASR	or just look at this
fridriksson07a_134.248_3.05.wav_ASR	yeah
fridriksson07a_137.428_1.36.wav_ASR	my oh
fridriksson07a_139.055_1.79.wav_ASR	he said then he got scared
fridriksson07a_141.995_0.98.wav_ASR	it's a rabbit
fridriksson07a_142.991_1.34.wav_ASR	so
fridriksson07a_144.644_1.55.wav_ASR	think she's having a stroke
fridriksson07a_147.515_0.959.wav_ASR	oh
fridriksson07a_148.682_5.37.wav_ASR	there's a household just about the next street over
fridriksson07a_154.827_4.81.wav_ASR	so my husband got me in the band and we've been over there
fridriksson07a_159.721_4.47.wav_ASR	and then thank goodness we had an internet that figured it was a slow
fridriksson07a_164.948_2.05.wav_ASR	he gave me the motivation
fridriksson07a_169.715_0.46.wav_ASR	yeah
fridriksson07a_170.861_9.05.wav_ASR	so uh and then they they didn't have a place to do treats
fridriksson07a_181.19_1.6.wav_ASR	but that internet you want to do
fridriksson07a_182.837_4.29.wav_ASR	so they had to put me in and then
fridriksson07a_187.588_0.56.wav_ASR	here we are
fridriksson07a_188.923_0.32.wav_ASR	yeah
fridriksson07a_190.497_1.22.wav_ASR	and so they kept saying
fridriksson07a_191.901_0.71.wav_ASR	okay
fridriksson07a_192.72_0.84.wav_ASR	are you okay
fridriksson07a_193.576_0.33.wav_ASR	in that
fridriksson07a_194.05_0.37.wav_ASR	it's true
fridriksson07a_194.439_6.32.wav_ASR	but then i begin to go in and out because i don't know what they were given me you know
fridriksson07a_201.391_3.15.wav_ASR	and then the doctor came in and he asked me what's my name
fridriksson07a_205.994_0.96.wav_ASR	yeah
fridriksson07a_208.898_2.28.wav_ASR	was trying to say it but i couldn't say it
fridriksson07a_212.171_1.48.wav_ASR	then then he said
fridriksson07a_214.35_0.88.wav_ASR	how are you
fridriksson07a_216.399_0.57.wav_ASR	yeah he said
fridriksson07a_217.111_0.9.wav_ASR	in your words
fridriksson07a_219.005_1.11.wav_ASR	you don't know
fridriksson07a_220.45_0.84.wav_ASR	you can't talk
fridriksson07a_222.063_0.94.wav_ASR	so
fridriksson07a_223.523_2.15.wav_ASR	one two three four five six seven
fridriksson07a_225.994_1.12.wav_ASR	well i didn't see it
fridriksson07a_227.24_4.21.wav_ASR	just counted twelve
fridriksson07a_232.323_2.83.wav_ASR	then i didn't
fridriksson07a_237.135_1.83.wav_ASR	and then i looked at him and i saw
fridriksson07a_239.277_2.64.wav_ASR	you must have my data because
fridriksson07a_242.792_1.95.wav_ASR	don't have enough fingers for that
fridriksson07a_245.021_3.54.wav_ASR	yeah
fridriksson07a_249.024_1.65.wav_ASR	it's it's it's
fridriksson07a_250.835_2.01.wav_ASR	you got a good sense of humour
fridriksson07a_256.82_0.3.wav_ASR	yeah
fridriksson07a_257.197_3.06.wav_ASR	and then later on they told me he said
fridriksson07a_261.769_4.051.wav_ASR	or or it's gonna sleep in the bed beside you tonight
fridriksson07a_266.85_4.52.wav_ASR	and we were in uh l. e. c. d. at that time
fridriksson07a_272.602_3.81.wav_ASR	and and i looked and i didn't know who my husband was
fridriksson07a_278.266_2.54.wav_ASR	and i thought it was some strange man but
fridriksson07a_280.927_0.75.wav_ASR	oh
fridriksson07a_282.262_4.19.wav_ASR	why didn't they put a dog in the room with me you know
fridriksson07a_286.975_1.15.wav_ASR	so so he said
fridriksson07a_288.267_0.67.wav_ASR	it's that's okay
fridriksson07a_288.958_0.49.wav_ASR	yeah
fridriksson07a_289.53_0.61.wav_ASR	shure
fridriksson07a_290.551_2.12.wav_ASR	yeah
fridriksson07a_292.915_0.91.wav_ASR	we can think
fridriksson07a_293.844_1.84.wav_ASR	yeah i just couldn't get any words out
fridriksson07a_296.74_3.11.wav_ASR	and then um then then he's
fridriksson07a_300.171_4.5.wav_ASR	but i in the middle of the night i walked up and and i recognise him
fridriksson07a_305.064_0.46.wav_ASR	you said
fridriksson07a_306.357_2.93.wav_ASR	or you're soring and i need to go to the bath room
fridriksson07a_310.253_0.99.wav_ASR	you got
fridriksson07a_313.88_0.85.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
fridriksson07a_316.138_0.459.wav_ASR	yeah
fridriksson07a_320.571_5.5.wav_ASR	now that's the first one that they picked up with the x. ray oh
fridriksson07a_327.299_0.71.wav_ASR	with the big one
fridriksson07a_334.398_3.35.wav_ASR	yeah i know it w i knew that that was my husband's name
fridriksson07a_339.397_0.45.wav_ASR	yeah
fridriksson07a_341.387_1.62.wav_ASR	stop scrolling
fridriksson07a_343.056_0.56.wav_ASR	and i said
fridriksson07a_345.03_1.51.wav_ASR	well i didn't say go to the bathroom
fridriksson07a_347.055_1.31.wav_ASR	beep
fridriksson07a_349.874_0.59.wav_ASR	yeah
fridriksson07a_354.28_3.94.wav_ASR	so they let him speak in my room every night that i was there
fridriksson07a_360.712_4.76.wav_ASR	they were helpful you know because they said you know sometimes
fridriksson07a_365.98_3.24.wav_ASR	because i lost control of everything though really
fridriksson07a_369.808_0.89.wav_ASR	that's really bad
fridriksson07a_373.4_2.59.wav_ASR	well they're i was there for a week
fridriksson07a_377.916_4.02.wav_ASR	and so they call the art
fridriksson07a_382.129_1.52.wav_ASR	we've gotta go home
fridriksson07a_383.794_0.35.wav_ASR	so
fridriksson07a_384.572_0.78.wav_ASR	our house is
fridriksson07a_385.43_2.51.wav_ASR	the batteries there and this and that you know
fridriksson07a_388.494_2.53.wav_ASR	and we were taking care of our doctors' house
fridriksson07a_391.627_6.21.wav_ASR	because she was done jordan then 'cause she was working there 'cause she was working there just for one year yeah
fridriksson07a_398.159_3.0.wav_ASR	and she got her p. h. d. so then she's struggling
fridriksson07a_401.878_2.74.wav_ASR	and so he said
fridriksson07a_404.804_1.78.wav_ASR	your i'm not gonna take
fridriksson07a_406.77_3.19.wav_ASR	they said so matthew said
fridriksson07a_410.531_2.16.wav_ASR	sh you have to go straight through
fridriksson07a_413.363_3.3.wav_ASR	you cannot stop just to go to the washroom and eat
fridriksson07a_417.146_3.1.wav_ASR	don't take s go to your house tonight
fridriksson07a_420.887_13.7.wav_ASR	and uh but in the meantime my son and lawrence got flat and back further back to uh textures to meet us when we got there
fridriksson07a_435.642_1.62.wav_ASR	he took me home and let me eat it
fridriksson07a_438.04_2.71.wav_ASR	or my husband gave
fridriksson07a_440.771_2.14.wav_ASR	and then we went on to the other half
fridriksson07a_443.23_1.41.wav_ASR	but they were very good too
fridriksson07a_444.686_2.19.wav_ASR	uh i stayed at the university
fridriksson07a_447.397_6.8.wav_ASR	why stayed at the honest uh straight clean for
fridriksson07a_456.3_2.82.wav_ASR	you think i was in there about three weeks
fridriksson07a_462.218_4.06.wav_ASR	but they had their own section
fridriksson07a_467.107_4.77.wav_ASR	and then i got in the wheel chair and
fridriksson07a_472.02_3.83.wav_ASR	don't want those lines that you you put your leg's in
fridriksson07a_476.555_1.66.wav_ASR	and i put my feet on the floor
fridriksson07a_478.5_1.15.wav_ASR	and that was it
fridriksson07a_488.923_2.87.wav_ASR	yeah i ran out of that software in the wheel chair
fridriksson07a_491.814_4.36.wav_ASR	well they wouldn't make the floor but it was a big flower you know
fridriksson07a_497.438_3.59.wav_ASR	so i but i was there for oh a long time
fridriksson07a_501.709_2.11.wav_ASR	but uh i think three or four weeks
fridriksson07a_503.871_1.97.wav_ASR	and then i was disappointed
fridriksson07a_505.858_4.21.wav_ASR	and then i had to come back for perhaps three times a week
fridriksson07a_519.422_3.589.wav_ASR	well we did the financial theory
fridriksson07a_523.03_9.341.wav_ASR	that was all included the physical the um to to learn how to say the words and stuff
fridriksson07a_533.132_5.07.wav_ASR	and then slowly but surely i realised that i've lost a lot of things
fridriksson07a_539.154_3.42.wav_ASR	because up here i could add like crazy and i still can
fridriksson07a_543.361_1.97.wav_ASR	but to get it out i can't do it
fridriksson07a_546.994_0.36.wav_ASR	yeah
fridriksson07a_552.553_5.4.wav_ASR	can't say it sometimes but when i write it down
fridriksson07a_559.385_8.25.wav_ASR	like if if i can add up to one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine i might put them near nine thousand one
fridriksson07a_573.324_1.49.wav_ASR	that was three years ago
fridriksson07a_575.777_2.22.wav_ASR	and the other one i know nothing about
fridriksson07a_578.016_3.11.wav_ASR	but they said there was a poorer one smaller one
fridriksson07a_586.492_1.93.wav_ASR	you even
fridriksson07a_597.83_0.48.wav_ASR	yeah
fridriksson07a_618.001_2.39.wav_ASR	well i'll start out with my husband
fridriksson07a_620.41_5.5.wav_ASR	we in and out we've been married forty nine years
fridriksson07a_627.119_2.11.wav_ASR	it's two children a boy and a girl
fridriksson07a_629.949_4.49.wav_ASR	and my daughter lives here in my spongy is in my sister
fridriksson07a_634.995_2.21.wav_ASR	and h and he has two s
fridriksson07a_637.772_6.55.wav_ASR	and then my daughter here we went to florid because she was working on her p. h. d. and
fridriksson07a_644.678_2.5.wav_ASR	now in flowers
fridriksson07a_647.575_1.38.wav_ASR	and we moved down there
fridriksson07a_649.271_5.85.wav_ASR	because then she got pregnant and her husband was working in d. c.
fridriksson07a_655.553_3.27.wav_ASR	so she we went down there to help take care of the baby
fridriksson07a_660.026_1.75.wav_ASR	yeah that was a good things
fridriksson07a_661.89_1.92.wav_ASR	but he's only six euros old now
fridriksson07a_664.689_1.74.wav_ASR	yeah cracker
fridriksson07a_670.593_1.86.wav_ASR	yeah
fridriksson07a_672.629_3.33.wav_ASR	there's three boys two and a mini and one here
fridriksson07a_711.443_2.53.wav_ASR	my grandsons he's a good soccer player
fridriksson07a_714.493_0.3.wav_ASR	yeah
fridriksson07a_717.518_0.61.wav_ASR	okay
fridriksson07a_718.66_2.54.wav_ASR	but this is uh he's kickin that
fridriksson07a_721.32_1.16.wav_ASR	he's playing
fridriksson07a_722.5_1.79.wav_ASR	and it's quick
fridriksson07a_725.909_3.58.wav_ASR	the ball is going to the man's go down
fridriksson07a_731.579_1.5.wav_ASR	oh oh
fridriksson07a_734.29_2.09.wav_ASR	oh this
fridriksson07a_741.969_2.72.wav_ASR	this is when the batteries is coming through his window
fridriksson07a_744.804_1.02.wav_ASR	the windows the green
fridriksson07a_747.278_3.42.wav_ASR	and this he's looking out probably to see who did it
fridriksson07a_752.449_1.52.wav_ASR	if i'd look for
fridriksson07a_785.694_3.29.wav_ASR	well i think
fridriksson07a_790.253_2.85.wav_ASR	so i this is not really number one right
fridriksson07a_796.242_0.63.wav_ASR	oh yeah
fridriksson07a_798.556_0.579.wav_ASR	yeah
fridriksson07a_799.992_4.2.wav_ASR	his mother's it's going off the scroll 'cause he's got a bad back
fridriksson07a_805.885_1.0.wav_ASR	it's raining
fridriksson07a_807.01_3.14.wav_ASR	why is it ringing first
fridriksson07a_810.817_0.66.wav_ASR	it's right
fridriksson07a_811.5_1.6.wav_ASR	he's got his umbrella right
fridriksson07a_815.878_0.51.wav_ASR	oh
fridriksson07a_817.162_0.42.wav_ASR	oh
fridriksson07a_821.77_2.95.wav_ASR	yeah it's an amber uh on here
fridriksson07a_825.093_5.53.wav_ASR	and that he must have been outside and it's raining and he comes back in for a umbrella right
fridriksson07a_832.955_1.49.wav_ASR	so not in order
fridriksson07a_840.232_2.07.wav_ASR	okay there he's getting ready to leave
fridriksson07a_842.321_2.02.wav_ASR	in his mother's giving him an umbrella
fridriksson07a_846.794_3.74.wav_ASR	which is which is why it's
fridriksson07a_852.162_0.48.wav_ASR	okay
fridriksson07a_854.431_2.41.wav_ASR	she's still giving him the amber right
fridriksson07a_857.405_1.36.wav_ASR	well these two go together
fridriksson07a_866.611_0.63.wav_ASR	he's really
fridriksson07a_868.979_2.65.wav_ASR	okay then he walks outside his room
fridriksson07a_871.65_3.54.wav_ASR	he didn't have the umbrella or he would put it up right
fridriksson07a_876.373_1.0.wav_ASR	he comes back in
fridriksson07a_877.593_0.6.wav_ASR	oh yeah
fridriksson07a_878.21_2.01.wav_ASR	it's now he has this
fridriksson07a_881.005_1.305.wav_ASR	don't need to go to school
fridriksson07a_882.387_2.95.wav_ASR	why didn't he put his number up and number three
fridriksson07a_888.499_0.65.wav_ASR	okay
fridriksson07a_902.448_0.37.wav_ASR	okay
fridriksson07a_903.463_3.92.wav_ASR	this one the cat is up a tree
fridriksson07a_908.344_2.97.wav_ASR	and the looks like the faster one after it
fridriksson07a_913.497_3.77.wav_ASR	and the little girl standing there ready to catch him i guess
fridriksson07a_917.394_1.71.wav_ASR	she was writing her book
fridriksson07a_921.067_0.67.wav_ASR	yeah it's a good idea
fridriksson07a_922.129_1.97.wav_ASR	oh here's a dog barking up the tree
fridriksson07a_924.145_1.83.wav_ASR	and they call the entire department
fridriksson07a_928.923_1.59.wav_ASR	so they'll get the cat out right
fridriksson07a_932.955_6.92.wav_ASR	we couldn't understand what the ladder's for but i guess the guy cleaned up the laundry and got in the tree and then the ladder fell
fridriksson07a_954.76_0.34.wav_ASR	yeah
fridriksson07a_958.107_4.76.wav_ASR	oh i think the last time i read it
fridriksson07a_975.646_0.54.wav_ASR	oh okay
fridriksson07a_1095.08_12.54.wav_ASR	well the the thing of it is that that's the sinderella was she was under the control of her stepmother and two stepsisters
fridriksson07a_1108.411_2.15.wav_ASR	and they would treat her like a maid
fridriksson07a_1111.509_4.88.wav_ASR	and then um they were having a bowl at the
fridriksson07a_1117.065_3.86.wav_ASR	that's what she was talking about the window at the top and everything
fridriksson07a_1121.443_6.61.wav_ASR	and then when they decided they wouldn't let her go because she would be in competition with the two sisters
fridriksson07a_1129.018_3.57.wav_ASR	and then a fi fair godmother came
fridriksson07a_1133.326_5.58.wav_ASR	and got her all dressed in everything and ready to go to the ball
fridriksson07a_1139.72_2.4.wav_ASR	you need a pair of uh spiders
fridriksson07a_1143.746_8.07.wav_ASR	and uh she went to the ball but she had to be back by twelve o'clock
fridriksson07a_1153.31_1.67.wav_ASR	and so she was demanding
fridriksson07a_1155.0_4.63.wav_ASR	the the prints chose her to dance with
fridriksson07a_1159.677_2.02.wav_ASR	and i guess he filled in low right away
fridriksson07a_1162.249_4.76.wav_ASR	and then the t clock or twelve
fridriksson07a_1167.86_3.01.wav_ASR	and she ran out but she lost the scribble
fridriksson07a_1172.448_1.9.wav_ASR	and then they found the slipper
fridriksson07a_1174.419_9.12.wav_ASR	and then sh by the time she got back her her her charger had turned to bump in
fridriksson07a_1184.579_1.19.wav_ASR	yeah that's right
fridriksson07a_1185.919_1.97.wav_ASR	okay yeah let me think a minute
fridriksson07a_1188.29_6.09.wav_ASR	um and so they were going all over looking for the person that lost the slip
fridriksson07a_1194.4_3.25.wav_ASR	and they came back to cinderella's house
fridriksson07a_1198.045_4.27.wav_ASR	so they're tried it with the two zippers and it didn't fit
fridriksson07a_1203.12_4.56.wav_ASR	so then they ask scenario
fridriksson07a_1207.7_1.21.wav_ASR	and they were just
fridriksson07a_1209.733_1.54.wav_ASR	oh no she wasn't even there
fridriksson07a_1211.295_5.34.wav_ASR	but when they turned it on then fit
fridriksson07a_1217.703_5.54.wav_ASR	so they took it back to the the cut uh power
fridriksson07a_1224.46_4.25.wav_ASR	and the she mattered the price
fridriksson07a_1231.895_1.51.wav_ASR	oh
fridriksson07a_1233.591_1.89.wav_ASR	okay so you left happily after
fridriksson07a_1235.5_2.72.wav_ASR	it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's
fridriksson07a_1250.689_2.41.wav_ASR	oh well first you get the pen battery out
fridriksson07a_1253.322_1.07.wav_ASR	you get your bread
fridriksson07a_1255.267_3.84.wav_ASR	you put it put the pen but on one side
fridriksson07a_1259.325_3.76.wav_ASR	and then the other side
fridriksson07a_1263.241_1.1.wav_ASR	yeah that's right
fridriksson07a_1264.393_1.48.wav_ASR	and
fridriksson07a_1266.034_0.62.wav_ASR	yeah
fridriksson07a_1269.257_2.28.wav_ASR	you do a lot of that
kansas01a_41.424_0.86.wav_ASR	oh no

kansas01a_612.96_0.54.wav_ASR	oh
kansas01a_628.319_1.87.wav_ASR	yeah but
kansas01a_656.504_0.3.wav_ASR	yeah
kansas01a_785.54_3.22.wav_ASR	it's the the work of walking
kansas01a_796.427_0.34.wav_ASR	yeah
kansas01a_799.188_2.5.wav_ASR	the uh voicing
kansas01a_802.938_5.45.wav_ASR	um don't have to do it
kansas01a_816.473_0.49.wav_ASR	yeah
kansas01a_858.727_2.98.wav_ASR	yeah
kansas01a_861.862_9.15.wav_ASR	do you want to walk or
kansas01a_872.298_0.39.wav_ASR	yeah
kansas04a_19.317_0.78.wav_ASR	fairly good
kansas04a_27.196_0.52.wav_ASR	yes
kansas04a_29.341_0.86.wav_ASR	please tell me about it
kansas04a_30.225_7.48.wav_ASR	it's uh fabian twenty eight in ninety eight
kansas04a_42.61_11.38.wav_ASR	well my stroke started on one night and i did not think it was too bad
kansas04a_54.764_1.58.wav_ASR	oh it's alright no extra
kansas04a_56.809_9.79.wav_ASR	and then i went out with my friends and uh they were concerned because i was driving radar
kansas04a_68.079_9.21.wav_ASR	uh she said that uh i drew too close to cars and i had difficulty with my speech
kansas04a_77.957_5.16.wav_ASR	and i went home and i met my husband at the local watering hole
kansas04a_84.83_3.35.wav_ASR	and uh uh had a drink and i went home
kansas04a_88.529_5.344.wav_ASR	oh that was not my usual uh way of doing
kansas04a_95.153_1.87.wav_ASR	don't talking to anybody or anything
kansas04a_97.072_3.29.wav_ASR	and uh so i went home and i went to bed that night
kansas04a_100.589_2.91.wav_ASR	and i got up the next morning and went to work
kansas04a_104.276_4.63.wav_ASR	uh we went to a uh our chamber meeting
kansas04a_109.508_10.63.wav_ASR	and uh i parked and went in and when i came back out i noticed that i'd parted very badly
kansas04a_121.372_4.48.wav_ASR	and i went to work and then uh one of the girls came in and said
kansas04a_126.873_2.64.wav_ASR	you're not using your arm correctly
kansas04a_131.007_0.4.wav_ASR	yeah that's right
kansas04a_131.688_1.2.wav_ASR	you think i'm having a struggle
kansas04a_133.315_0.93.wav_ASR	call the doctor
kansas04a_134.744_8.79.wav_ASR	and he told me she told me to go to the emergency room and uh not to destroy
kansas04a_144.096_13.82.wav_ASR	and at that point i was confused enough that i was thinking about the uh amplifiers across the street and not uh one across the street from my office
kansas04a_158.827_1.8.wav_ASR	so i think i drew myself
kansas04a_161.92_1.11.wav_ASR	so i drew myself
kansas04a_163.284_3.31.wav_ASR	oh i got out there part in the problem play
kansas04a_167.312_3.2.wav_ASR	and went in and and then i met my husband there
kansas04a_170.986_6.08.wav_ASR	and uh i told him to tell them what what i thought
kansas04a_177.562_3.58.wav_ASR	because i could not communicate at that point
kansas04a_182.356_4.06.wav_ASR	and i was there f for tonight and they sent me home
kansas04a_187.406_9.41.wav_ASR	and then i did not feel well the next morning so i i had him take me back to the hospital and i stayed for couple weeks
kansas04a_207.011_5.1.wav_ASR	well i had therapy and on my speech and uh writing
kansas04a_213.604_6.17.wav_ASR	um but they didn't give it to me for very long
kansas04a_220.931_5.04.wav_ASR	mean uh i was just when i was in the hospital i had my speech and uh writing therapy
kansas04a_226.382_3.15.wav_ASR	and then i got home and had some physical therapy
kansas04a_259.052_0.729.wav_ASR	it's done
kansas04a_263.423_8.6.wav_ASR	well when i got married the first time i had to uh plan my whole wedding myself because mom was much older
kansas04a_273.102_2.34.wav_ASR	and she left it up to me
kansas04a_276.529_5.33.wav_ASR	and uh i went home and then we went back to lorries
kansas04a_281.881_3.75.wav_ASR	and i got married in london uh in darent's capital
kansas04a_294.955_9.48.wav_ASR	and we had dinner and uh then we went to back to the hotel
kansas04a_304.94_3.42.wav_ASR	and uh
kansas04a_309.335_2.86.wav_ASR	and he's a master of music design
kansas04a_313.018_7.98.wav_ASR	and his wife took over the bathroom
kansas04a_322.108_15.2.wav_ASR	and uh so then we went to the chamber and on the way uh my brother and i was driving and he almost reckoned us
kansas04a_342.23_1.91.wav_ASR	but i think that will be enough at that store
kansas04a_369.621_4.36.wav_ASR	well this little boy is practicing his sugar bowl
kansas04a_376.048_2.66.wav_ASR	and then he kicks it through the window
kansas04a_379.812_1.49.wav_ASR	and it breaks the window
kansas04a_382.375_3.03.wav_ASR	and it goes into this man's house
kansas04a_386.256_1.9.wav_ASR	and he's very started
kansas04a_389.349_6.47.wav_ASR	and uh he gets up and looks out the window to see where it came from
kansas04a_396.096_10.7.wav_ASR	now it does not tell you whether the boy ran away or whether he came and confess that he had uh kicked the soccer ball
kansas04a_435.24_4.79.wav_ASR	mother wants the s little boy to take the upper body
kansas04a_443.068_1.73.wav_ASR	doesn't want to take the upper
kansas04a_446.585_4.68.wav_ASR	so it goes out and its starts to range according as his mother told him it would
kansas04a_452.243_1.56.wav_ASR	so he goes back
kansas04a_454.24_0.91.wav_ASR	she tells it
kansas04a_455.171_1.15.wav_ASR	and it's very wet
kansas04a_457.426_5.56.wav_ASR	so we goes back in the house and she's very angry with him because he hasn't taken the amber
kansas04a_463.777_7.44.wav_ASR	so in the last picture he has the amber and it's up and he's walking very happily
kansas04a_506.81_1.84.wav_ASR	well the cat is in the tree
kansas04a_510.155_1.81.wav_ASR	dog is backing
kansas04a_513.126_4.38.wav_ASR	and the little girl is crying 'cause her cat is in the tree
kansas04a_519.099_8.07.wav_ASR	and her father tried to get it with a ladder and the ladder has fallen down
kansas04a_527.276_4.41.wav_ASR	and the father is still in the street it's looking very gloomy
kansas04a_532.649_2.56.wav_ASR	and the birds are singing
kansas04a_537.485_4.46.wav_ASR	that's rather clear is everything else is going on
kansas04a_542.482_5.22.wav_ASR	and the farmer has been called and they are going to have to get the cat down
kansas04a_547.988_3.8.wav_ASR	but i think before they do they'll have to get dead
kansas04a_576.487_1.57.wav_ASR	there is been a flat
kansas04a_582.466_4.23.wav_ASR	and this later has been swept away in the flood
kansas04a_590.504_12.69.wav_ASR	and this gentleman in the jacket is coming to rescue her
kansas04a_604.912_6.77.wav_ASR	is it's been swept away in the flat also looks to me
kansas04a_613.723_13.02.wav_ASR	and i do not quite understand this part
kansas04a_634.622_1.22.wav_ASR	yeah i think i yeah
kansas04a_636.851_1.21.wav_ASR	yeah what is that
kansas04a_643.48_6.31.wav_ASR	yeah but which one is being rejected in which one isn't
kansas04a_661.844_0.6.wav_ASR	oh yeah
kansas04a_668.087_0.84.wav_ASR	now therefore
kansas04a_688.588_0.82.wav_ASR	okay
kansas04a_756.402_5.91.wav_ASR	the story is about cinderella and a wicked stepmother and their two half sisters
kansas04a_762.492_0.68.wav_ASR	oh yeah
kansas04a_763.997_11.67.wav_ASR	uh her step sisters were very unkind to her and her step mother was too
kansas04a_776.051_5.38.wav_ASR	cinara was left to sweep and clean and do whatever they wanted done
kansas04a_782.592_7.02.wav_ASR	so they got a letter inviting the household to the the ball
kansas04a_791.424_5.37.wav_ASR	the mother said that cinderella could not go
kansas04a_798.1_1.62.wav_ASR	and she was very up set
kansas04a_800.608_12.89.wav_ASR	and uh so she tried to uh get her dress together and the uh two step sisters tied apart
kansas04a_815.132_22.74.wav_ASR	and so um she went out and told her uh very god mother uh that they had to turn it apart she wasn't going to get to go
kansas04a_837.925_6.54.wav_ASR	and and she was trying and and the very god mother said i yes she could
kansas04a_845.377_4.79.wav_ASR	you're not dressed and uh in with their word of course
kansas04a_850.747_14.83.wav_ASR	uh and uh so the step mother and step children started out and she did not go with them
kansas04a_865.963_15.24.wav_ASR	but she went in the care that the very godmother mother had cooked out of a pumpkin and uh mice and horses and uh mouse and horse
kansas04a_881.57_0.95.wav_ASR	and a horse
kansas04a_883.45_2.91.wav_ASR	uh and she went to the ball
kansas04a_887.004_4.42.wav_ASR	and the print's read her at the ball
kansas04a_892.03_1.55.wav_ASR	and uh they dance
kansas04a_893.647_1.85.wav_ASR	and then it was a twelve and a half
kansas04a_895.645_2.1.wav_ASR	she had to be home by twelve o'clock
kansas04a_897.799_2.56.wav_ASR	so she ran out and lost her spider
kansas04a_901.571_7.85.wav_ASR	and uh she went and got the camera and caught the camera all captured
kansas04a_909.825_1.47.wav_ASR	and she went home
kansas04a_912.607_9.82.wav_ASR	and uh then the following week or so time allows
kansas04a_922.783_10.71.wav_ASR	uh the uh fruit man was sent out with a a the slider to find w which longer in the in the kingdom
kansas04a_934.46_7.29.wav_ASR	and uh she was locked in her room so she could not get to the come down
kansas04a_942.65_2.64.wav_ASR	and she was very up set
kansas04a_946.239_4.44.wav_ASR	and uh
kansas04a_952.096_3.38.wav_ASR	anyway the the mouse folder out
kansas04a_957.72_3.9.wav_ASR	and she came down and and of course she fit the slider
kansas04a_962.075_1.87.wav_ASR	but the other did not
kansas04a_972.186_1.4.wav_ASR	yes
kansas04a_981.336_5.42.wav_ASR	i would get two pieces of red the pen butter and the children
kansas04a_988.038_1.31.wav_ASR	then i would get a nice
kansas04a_990.452_4.73.wav_ASR	and get it get some of the pen battery and spread it on one piece of red
kansas04a_995.9_4.73.wav_ASR	spread the geometry on the same piece of bread
kansas04a_1001.062_1.38.wav_ASR	and then put the top on it
kansas04a_1005.16_3.55.wav_ASR	oh yes
kansas05a_1.945_0.43.wav_ASR	uh-huh
kansas05a_16.495_9.12.wav_ASR	um
kansas05a_27.668_2.99.wav_ASR	uh uh i i'm okay
kansas05a_36.768_1.91.wav_ASR	oh yeah
kansas05a_42.431_11.8.wav_ASR	um uh over that time it's uh it's different
kansas05a_57.983_25.89.wav_ASR	um
kansas05a_87.858_2.74.wav_ASR	yeah i had my family

kansas05a_207.24_0.53.wav_ASR	turn me again
kansas05a_213.723_5.06.wav_ASR	oh oh that's all what i'm doing all this time
kansas05a_219.111_2.39.wav_ASR	oh putting together uh you know
kansas05a_221.765_2.76.wav_ASR	working with my my family
kansas05a_225.46_2.16.wav_ASR	uh all of my friends a little people
kansas05a_228.695_4.27.wav_ASR	uh making uh changing my life that's what i'm trying to do
kansas05a_240.771_2.37.wav_ASR	oh it's it's a long story
kansas05a_248.011_12.95.wav_ASR	um we just i made different i'm making darker dark all the time
kansas05a_261.75_1.8.wav_ASR	but the people who have lived with me
kansas05a_265.238_4.71.wav_ASR	uh and oh what my family
kansas05a_271.278_1.91.wav_ASR	it's amazing but people have had to do it
kansas05a_314.406_2.47.wav_ASR	there's a lot of their
kansas05a_317.968_1.25.wav_ASR	oh
kansas05a_336.496_20.16.wav_ASR	um i guess i could talk about you know what we're doing right you know right now
kansas05a_358.095_5.66.wav_ASR	um and and i'm trying to do the more you know as soon as i could
kansas05a_363.8_0.7.wav_ASR	you know our
kansas05a_364.761_2.21.wav_ASR	you didn't mean that
kansas05a_374.375_2.99.wav_ASR	because i want to have us to do better
kansas05a_379.021_4.21.wav_ASR	uh it's much more difficult
kansas05a_384.531_4.34.wav_ASR	you know when i look around and i see a lot of people who know
kansas05a_389.118_1.34.wav_ASR	you know they go their own way
kansas05a_390.473_0.99.wav_ASR	you don't talk to people
kansas05a_391.485_2.95.wav_ASR	um uh a bit more in different i problems
kansas05a_394.676_3.96.wav_ASR	you know i have no problems with my legs you know and all that
kansas05a_398.681_2.2.wav_ASR	don't have any problems particular
kansas05a_401.308_2.97.wav_ASR	are you used to have time as time gone on i had to get better
kansas05a_405.255_6.03.wav_ASR	um but um
kansas05a_411.561_1.63.wav_ASR	what were you asking me again
kansas05a_420.085_1.64.wav_ASR	oh yeah
kansas05a_422.593_9.96.wav_ASR	um we're i'm working along with working towards more time more
kansas05a_434.918_3.07.wav_ASR	as time goes on i learned more and more what to do
kansas05a_439.556_1.65.wav_ASR	uh and so that's what i'm doing
kansas05a_467.065_0.97.wav_ASR	so they come different
kansas05a_468.95_4.67.wav_ASR	so tell me the story with a beginning and an end
kansas05a_473.861_0.95.wav_ASR	of each one
kansas05a_480.821_2.29.wav_ASR	so each one of these i'm supposed to do something with it
kansas05a_483.43_0.79.wav_ASR	is that what you said
kansas05a_497.343_0.77.wav_ASR	oh
kansas05a_504.475_17.939.wav_ASR	um well the first the first one
kansas05a_529.355_7.84.wav_ASR	it's a it's a plain a plain a plain a plain uh a problem
kansas05a_540.213_11.2.wav_ASR	um that would with a uh that's a a list a plan or uh
kansas05a_554.453_7.16.wav_ASR	there's a a fruit eating with that per cent
kansas05a_563.678_3.27.wav_ASR	because the these people are making a problem
kansas05a_580.09_0.63.wav_ASR	what is that
kansas05a_589.826_1.82.wav_ASR	oh well that's kind of dumb stuff
kansas05a_593.266_2.41.wav_ASR	and i think that takes a little work to make that look right
kansas05a_596.395_2.36.wav_ASR	um okay i'm supposed to
kansas05a_600.809_1.48.wav_ASR	when am i supposed to do it with this one
kansas05a_603.491_0.94.wav_ASR	what's it a fruit of
kansas05a_605.0_1.13.wav_ASR	did the window break
kansas05a_608.523_1.45.wav_ASR	okay well that's it then
kansas05a_643.723_19.47.wav_ASR	so the the first person is and n n n s um a problem there
kansas05a_666.113_5.28.wav_ASR	oh
kansas05a_674.141_4.53.wav_ASR	oh looking at the tier trends agains
kansas05a_681.195_14.69.wav_ASR	um and believing that the second people should um
kansas05a_702.031_0.71.wav_ASR	think so
kansas05a_703.736_3.14.wav_ASR	he he's not supposed to do that for him
kansas05a_708.008_3.8.wav_ASR	that one guy wants the uh these pins to come down
kansas05a_712.325_1.15.wav_ASR	or he wants to buy it himself
kansas05a_715.293_1.03.wav_ASR	it's not quite right
kansas05a_718.205_0.34.wav_ASR	what
kansas05a_719.0_0.38.wav_ASR	which one
kansas05a_721.863_10.62.wav_ASR	uh there he's looking out forward on the the the the the cheers on how to deal with those things
kansas05a_732.528_5.87.wav_ASR	and in the in the old stuff that that's being afraid there
kansas05a_740.616_16.13.wav_ASR	uh they're they're the the the mother of w her person of w what went all the the little problems that they look here together
kansas05a_759.633_4.72.wav_ASR	go to the end of the screen
kansas05a_764.921_0.88.wav_ASR	exac oh i see
kansas05a_766.03_12.56.wav_ASR	his mother wanted him to go back to the good stuff he was done before so that he can go back on to this this kind of stuff again that makes them look better
kansas05a_779.24_4.95.wav_ASR	but it goes back and the ideas that he's got make them go back and look look better
kansas05a_812.463_2.81.wav_ASR	well i guess you'd start with that
kansas05a_819.976_6.9.wav_ASR	people sitting with their they're ma they're s mess they're stuff around
kansas05a_827.928_1.1.wav_ASR	and to his
kansas05a_831.043_4.35.wav_ASR	according the m the kind of s budget must people there
kansas05a_837.143_11.29.wav_ASR	uh well let's see there's the the man who's trying to talk with him about that back over to that kind of stuff
kansas05a_848.486_4.42.wav_ASR	it was going to be overly carried by this younger stuff
kansas05a_854.133_3.71.wav_ASR	this can't make it is big enough to make that kind of stuff
kansas05a_859.378_4.24.wav_ASR	uh then there would be this thing
kansas05a_864.8_5.88.wav_ASR	it's isn't necessarily what's going on here but it's there
kansas05a_872.161_11.16.wav_ASR	uh here's the the mer mer s the people
kansas05a_888.045_3.84.wav_ASR	the person that's putting this stuff together
kansas05a_893.315_5.28.wav_ASR	uh he's got he's got a person ready to help him with that
kansas05a_899.503_11.32.wav_ASR	here's uh information to him from the the people down s in stars trying to put this together with the new set
kansas05a_911.256_10.74.wav_ASR	here's the new uh the the young uh person who's trying to put that money back here so it goes everywhere in all of these things
kansas05a_922.725_3.13.wav_ASR	and then there is a natural
kansas05a_925.875_17.6.wav_ASR	and then at the end of all of that stuff our stories from uh people in uh these kinds of of things putting together for the guy who's putting it all together and uh these kinds of of things putting together
kansas05a_967.973_0.77.wav_ASR	yeah let's see
kansas05a_972.913_22.41.wav_ASR	they got they got they both uh their both their ideas from two uh exchangers from two
kansas05a_997.033_19.13.wav_ASR	uh the oldest one is or no the new the younger uh is the the young the person who's putting together that that old stuff uh that he's trying to help him for himself
kansas05a_1017.493_7.68.wav_ASR	then there's a uh then his that's a m a young um a man
kansas05a_1025.219_1.919.wav_ASR	now it's a woman who's doing that
kansas05a_1027.931_5.52.wav_ASR	then a woman a man is putting this stuff uh for him
kansas05a_1033.56_13.711.wav_ASR	and he's putting together with the information that he has to take all this from this personal stuff
kansas05a_1047.441_1.51.wav_ASR	it's been erased from
kansas05a_1049.31_24.37.wav_ASR	and the new person is trying to put all of that stuff together so s that she can uh help to provide the two or three different ideas in order to get the new money money's that can begin to help with the idea's there
kansas05a_1090.976_0.51.wav_ASR	don't know
kansas05a_1092.263_0.65.wav_ASR	oh no
kansas05a_1097.783_0.78.wav_ASR	or shared directory
kansas05a_1103.655_0.4.wav_ASR	oh
kansas05a_1123.313_1.14.wav_ASR	but that should be interesting
kansas05a_1127.098_0.78.wav_ASR	okay so
kansas05a_1128.523_0.54.wav_ASR	so what
kansas05a_1130.473_0.31.wav_ASR	okay
kansas05a_1189.6_1.38.wav_ASR	well it should take a day
kansas05a_1195.851_0.835.wav_ASR	don't look at
kansas05a_1197.755_1.81.wav_ASR	oh i never get all that
kansas05a_1203.874_1.92.wav_ASR	and i was expecting the s in the in the in the in the c. d. player
kansas05a_1206.021_1.35.wav_ASR	oh i don't i don't even know
kansas05a_1209.333_2.21.wav_ASR	you know i knew what it was but i don't
kansas05a_1218.316_0.39.wav_ASR	yes
kansas05a_1223.091_0.33.wav_ASR	yes
kansas05a_1239.87_1.34.wav_ASR	oh i know how i'm doing it
kansas05a_1245.243_11.95.wav_ASR	um a wire wire s wire from my money here to get me the kind of thing i want
kansas05a_1257.933_7.82.wav_ASR	put it out the the amount of a little um pl little little programmes that
kansas05a_1265.928_0.52.wav_ASR	oh right
kansas05a_1268.256_7.25.wav_ASR	having me have two two plates so two little things sitting on here to to cost for me and provide
kansas05a_1277.996_5.14.wav_ASR	yeah that's exactly the fact i just did this the last that last day i was putting all of that together
kansas05a_1287.4_6.32.wav_ASR	oh well i have to have the i have the the place right here first
kansas05a_1294.091_1.156.wav_ASR	tap this
kansas05a_1295.568_3.17.wav_ASR	and then you have to have two ears of that probably
kansas05a_1299.11_4.96.wav_ASR	you know you got two two messages generally for the kind that you're going to have
kansas05a_1304.858_1.94.wav_ASR	and uh then you put it there
kansas05a_1306.813_9.31.wav_ASR	and you probably have to have something more than just this because it keep it from uh from uh tighter missing
kansas05a_1316.678_5.2.wav_ASR	you have to have little a little here first to keep things working so they get out
kansas05a_1322.798_3.42.wav_ASR	then you have uh the first part
kansas05a_1326.278_1.72.wav_ASR	then then you do this part there
kansas05a_1328.518_4.92.wav_ASR	then then you have the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the
kansas05a_1333.611_1.42.wav_ASR	then you have that next one here
kansas05a_1335.05_2.94.wav_ASR	you you mur it out on the a a topping kind
kansas05a_1338.036_1.46.wav_ASR	and then you give it to this kind
kansas05a_1340.198_4.1.wav_ASR	and then you then you put it together and then you get three
kempler02a_7.309_0.88.wav_ASR	you don't know
kempler02a_10.687_0.94.wav_ASR	oh no
kempler02a_17.217_1.42.wav_ASR	um good
kempler02a_21.833_0.55.wav_ASR	that's all
kempler02a_30.281_14.53.wav_ASR	um um i think um uh i think um
kempler02a_45.607_6.85.wav_ASR	um
kempler02a_62.927_2.27.wav_ASR	um i don't remember
kempler02a_72.724_17.29.wav_ASR	um um um i have to be in good quality
kempler02a_91.429_13.46.wav_ASR	um and then a mermer and colours i uh learned to speech
kempler02a_144.898_8.22.wav_ASR	um um i like the
kempler02a_154.026_5.29.wav_ASR	um it's an hour away

kempler02a_1014.106_3.37.wav_ASR	um it's good
kurland04a_100.958_0.73.wav_ASR	yes i am
kurland04a_133.677_3.85.wav_ASR	um not the way that i'd like it to to be
kurland04a_142.047_3.88.wav_ASR	yeah um uh no better of all five
kurland04a_148.292_3.35.wav_ASR	um i was working
kurland04a_151.852_1.09.wav_ASR	and it was a
kurland04a_152.958_1.36.wav_ASR	but i wasn't working at the time
kurland04a_154.335_3.09.wav_ASR	um i um was on a sunday
kurland04a_157.474_2.18.wav_ASR	and i was very tired
kurland04a_160.138_1.68.wav_ASR	and i went grocery shopping
kurland04a_162.283_4.1.wav_ASR	and um i was so tired
kurland04a_166.4_0.98.wav_ASR	uh
kurland04a_167.4_1.48.wav_ASR	oh
kurland04a_168.9_1.12.wav_ASR	yeah put it all
kurland04a_170.652_1.69.wav_ASR	and then i yeah
kurland04a_172.62_0.95.wav_ASR	okay
kurland04a_173.692_8.26.wav_ASR	and when i lay down um the right side of my body was prevailed
kurland04a_182.415_3.14.wav_ASR	and i was in an hour of consciousness
kurland04a_185.7_1.92.wav_ASR	and my husband came home
kurland04a_187.666_3.16.wav_ASR	and i was t uncorrect on the floor
kurland04a_191.887_3.83.wav_ASR	so that's all i remember you know
kurland04a_195.975_0.33.wav_ASR	so
kurland04a_202.752_16.23.wav_ASR	um i had i was in the household for a week because um part of what happened was that my um the bulb on my side was glowing probably
kurland04a_219.0_3.33.wav_ASR	and the blind pulled in
kurland04a_222.345_1.52.wav_ASR	and then it should uh
kurland04a_224.664_0.95.wav_ASR	uh
kurland04a_225.954_2.1.wav_ASR	so they had to uh
kurland04a_228.266_2.79.wav_ASR	and i had um a fit
kurland04a_231.938_6.9.wav_ASR	and so they had to make sure that my a. film film was um stable
kurland04a_239.364_2.59.wav_ASR	and so i was in the hardware for a wee
kurland04a_242.0_10.56.wav_ASR	and then they um uh discharge me to um wednesday in in um spongefield
kurland04a_253.376_8.119.wav_ASR	and they they um they did switch me after a week
kurland04a_261.935_9.93.wav_ASR	and then um i went um today for um a month um for our um a month
kurland04a_272.333_8.66.wav_ASR	and um i took um speech and um o. t.
kurland04a_282.007_2.28.wav_ASR	and then um they just charge
kurland04a_284.31_4.33.wav_ASR	and then i went to cooly d for my speech
kurland04a_289.838_8.71.wav_ASR	and um i i try to um talk um whenever i can to help me
kurland04a_298.952_7.62.wav_ASR	and um i went back to speech um after i was disappointed

kurland05a_421.506_4.57.wav_ASR	um one thing it was quite clear i was very tight
kurland05a_426.134_3.9.wav_ASR	so i use the six arrow slide and yeah when i'm working
kurland05a_430.627_6.75.wav_ASR	but probably wouldn't have to uh nine hours yeah and with a and a again in the afternoon for like a half an hour
kurland05a_439.185_11.7.wav_ASR	ah yeah in my theory
kurland05a_450.9_1.92.wav_ASR	could she uh try to help me with that
kurland05a_453.377_9.07.wav_ASR	and the other way
kurland05a_463.012_4.16.wav_ASR	or we could uh have a paper in the like a kind of a kind of speech
kurland05a_467.738_5.68.wav_ASR	but i it was not able to uh really talk you know like well
kurland05a_475.53_10.57.wav_ASR	just this way i can describe things um yeah if i was a thirty five uh r. p. recorder
kurland05a_486.35_2.39.wav_ASR	you just can get it
kurland05a_489.477_14.42.wav_ASR	and uh it's not quite so bad
kurland05a_504.51_7.96.wav_ASR	oh very much like nowadays there's there's too many people on the
kurland05a_515.462_0.671.wav_ASR	it's a bit
kurland05a_554.732_7.46.wav_ASR	well i have many things uh i'll say one
kurland05a_564.856_3.3.wav_ASR	my scroll talk uh please uh help uh
kurland05a_568.92_6.03.wav_ASR	and uh my personal year ended uh altogether first you know
kurland05a_575.71_0.86.wav_ASR	it was it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's
kurland05a_576.684_1.21.wav_ASR	well
kurland05a_578.401_1.34.wav_ASR	yeah like five months to go
kurland05a_579.76_4.27.wav_ASR	oh i was i was uh had on all my keyboards
kurland05a_584.704_4.17.wav_ASR	so i i want a fruit to uh colourful screens
kurland05a_589.765_1.96.wav_ASR	and uh that's right
kurland05a_592.346_2.85.wav_ASR	it was i don't know
kurland05a_595.53_1.56.wav_ASR	oh yeah
kurland05a_601.36_2.91.wav_ASR	yeah
kurland05a_604.371_11.19.wav_ASR	oh well i got up to f etcetera
kurland05a_622.298_0.93.wav_ASR	yeah
kurland05a_624.482_0.93.wav_ASR	you never use to write
kurland05a_630.564_8.41.wav_ASR	but uh it's it's it's it's a lot better than a low battery or a lost
kurland05a_639.446_6.27.wav_ASR	and uh that's you
kurland05a_649.2_2.38.wav_ASR	yeah
kurland05a_653.67_4.13.wav_ASR	and here uh amazing gaze at a giraffe
kurland05a_662.527_0.85.wav_ASR	don't worry
kurland05a_666.225_1.64.wav_ASR	yeah that's right
kurland05a_668.408_6.34.wav_ASR	because yeah i'd be able to draw it or something
kurland05a_674.801_6.03.wav_ASR	yeah it's very uh very awkward
kurland05a_685.515_3.9.wav_ASR	oh yeah
kurland05a_690.856_2.46.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
kurland05a_695.249_3.53.wav_ASR	it might be some stuff like the battery
kurland05a_700.718_10.62.wav_ASR	yeah
kurland05a_712.137_5.12.wav_ASR	yeah i don't think so
kurland05a_717.971_2.22.wav_ASR	it's it's fine
kurland05a_722.507_2.3.wav_ASR	well it's a bit of my female friends
kurland05a_725.084_2.06.wav_ASR	yeah
kurland05a_727.159_0.59.wav_ASR	yeah
kurland05a_736.401_0.79.wav_ASR	oh no
kurland05a_767.64_0.42.wav_ASR	alright
kurland05a_768.713_6.43.wav_ASR	well this comes uh r right on the roof 'cause it plays soft
kurland05a_775.731_4.04.wav_ASR	and uh the first picture shows a young guy playing soccer
kurland05a_780.772_0.81.wav_ASR	he kicks the ball
kurland05a_781.6_6.34.wav_ASR	and uh it must be s too close to the house because uh he put the power there
kurland05a_789.212_6.9.wav_ASR	and uh as long as we're selling right by the window
kurland05a_796.131_4.91.wav_ASR	and you knocked the window over it's too much and smashed
kurland05a_801.46_2.26.wav_ASR	it's it's
kurland05a_804.612_7.97.wav_ASR	and uh the last uh picture shows the homepage
kurland05a_812.6_5.26.wav_ASR	so i can imagine what it would be like
kurland05a_855.661_3.73.wav_ASR	well i guess it shows a woman and uh probably your son
kurland05a_860.063_1.44.wav_ASR	and he must to go outside again
kurland05a_862.307_0.51.wav_ASR	it's hers
kurland05a_862.998_2.06.wav_ASR	take your b rubber yeah
kurland05a_865.108_1.27.wav_ASR	oh it's you don't want to take it
kurland05a_867.751_2.56.wav_ASR	and she asked to um twice i guess
kurland05a_870.393_1.62.wav_ASR	and uh
kurland05a_872.035_0.74.wav_ASR	it's all right
kurland05a_872.828_3.42.wav_ASR	the third picture shows a giraffe
kurland05a_876.326_4.09.wav_ASR	it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's
kurland05a_882.162_1.98.wav_ASR	so we can go back and side by side
kurland05a_884.93_0.85.wav_ASR	and
kurland05a_885.939_0.89.wav_ASR	but i thought so
kurland05a_886.879_5.12.wav_ASR	well the last picture shows it with uh a bullet like it should have at the first place
kurland05a_903.958_0.5.wav_ASR	oh right
kurland05a_916.499_3.08.wav_ASR	well it's a cat kind of the tree
kurland05a_919.6_3.77.wav_ASR	yeah it could get down
kurland05a_925.566_9.21.wav_ASR	and uh a whole order of somebody um a email trying to get it together and he could get the cat don't he
kurland05a_936.567_1.42.wav_ASR	the girls' pride
kurland05a_939.74_3.82.wav_ASR	oh
kurland05a_944.348_0.99.wav_ASR	so he stuck
kurland05a_945.353_5.63.wav_ASR	and the dark g yeah black at the cat and the the kind of the cat
kurland05a_951.07_3.66.wav_ASR	so guess we know why the cat is up in the tree
kurland05a_955.677_6.53.wav_ASR	and then it's uh wait a minute it shows the white part of the screen and the guy
kurland05a_965.049_1.31.wav_ASR	it's it's one
kurland05a_992.053_3.05.wav_ASR	oh my god
kurland05a_997.143_0.83.wav_ASR	you
kurland05a_998.255_3.97.wav_ASR	you watch it all the all the disney movies yeah over and over again
kurland05a_1003.251_2.88.wav_ASR	yeah
kurland05a_1008.346_1.36.wav_ASR	forties yeah
kurland05a_1011.908_1.15.wav_ASR	oh
kurland05a_1016.878_9.9.wav_ASR	well it i watched so many movies
kurland05a_1041.624_0.32.wav_ASR	yeah
kurland05a_1045.64_1.219.wav_ASR	yeah
kurland05a_1049.637_0.39.wav_ASR	oh
kurland05a_1129.285_5.26.wav_ASR	it's gonna be very short
kurland05a_1136.092_2.46.wav_ASR	uh it starts off with the arrow
kurland05a_1138.93_1.73.wav_ASR	it think she has two sensors maybe
kurland05a_1140.678_8.22.wav_ASR	and she's the leader of the third even though she's the third
kurland05a_1150.4_1.95.wav_ASR	her mother is uh even worse
kurland05a_1152.368_6.1.wav_ASR	yeah i think it's a good idea
kurland05a_1159.027_3.22.wav_ASR	yeah
kurland05a_1163.206_2.53.wav_ASR	they always she wanted to go the ball
kurland05a_1165.752_0.99.wav_ASR	oh
kurland05a_1166.764_5.58.wav_ASR	it's somehow she got it's the ball
kurland05a_1172.459_3.71.wav_ASR	yeah it's at the ball there's the print there
kurland05a_1177.292_2.11.wav_ASR	and uh i think it's a spider
kurland05a_1179.426_3.52.wav_ASR	try to slip around the
kurland05a_1183.783_5.14.wav_ASR	and uh as long would have it
kurland05a_1190.594_3.78.wav_ASR	and anyway uh i hope
kurland05a_1194.524_3.16.wav_ASR	so i think uh
kurland05a_1201.033_0.43.wav_ASR	yeah
kurland05a_1220.688_0.84.wav_ASR	that's pretty easy
kurland05a_1222.699_3.27.wav_ASR	we would take uh the bit of the disk box
kurland05a_1227.109_5.61.wav_ASR	and they use only arrows uh whole red bits because that's helpful
kurland05a_1234.237_4.55.wav_ASR	yeah i think it's for like six months for like six months now
kurland05a_1239.613_1.78.wav_ASR	and
kurland05a_1241.442_5.12.wav_ASR	yeah it's a good bit of two piece of two bit of two bit of two bit of two bit of two bit of two bit of two bit of two bit of two bit of two bit of two bit of two bit of two bit of two bit of two bit of two bit of two bit of two
kurland05a_1247.075_1.39.wav_ASR	they made it a table
kurland05a_1249.538_2.64.wav_ASR	and then one i put the grid
kurland05a_1252.921_0.81.wav_ASR	you don't need
kurland05a_1254.656_4.23.wav_ASR	and then i put uh spaghetti smooth uh on the other side
kurland05a_1259.156_3.63.wav_ASR	put the pieces together
kurland05a_1262.831_7.23.wav_ASR	and then four pieces 'cause uh i don't know if it's too big or too small
kurland05a_1270.32_5.5.wav_ASR	and then i uh have uh a little bags that you yeah put it in
kurland05a_1275.84_2.65.wav_ASR	and they enclosed it in the bag
kurland05a_1278.506_3.21.wav_ASR	and i'm ready to go
kurland05b_50.075_4.4.wav_ASR	my speech is uh
kurland05b_56.5_10.98.wav_ASR	it's it's it's like a like a one and ten ten per cent
kurland05b_68.384_18.84.wav_ASR	and um uh depending on you how much sleep i had and you can it can be like a seven or eight
kurland05b_97.474_0.39.wav_ASR	oh yeah
kurland05b_101.171_8.37.wav_ASR	uh uh my straw according to a spongy early third i think it was
kurland05b_110.667_3.95.wav_ASR	middle third um in the afternoon
kurland05b_115.886_5.05.wav_ASR	oh it's uh taking my sun
kurland05b_121.942_7.89.wav_ASR	and sometimes during uh
kurland05b_131.038_7.6.wav_ASR	and uh
kurland05b_138.764_4.16.wav_ASR	and uh you know something wrong
kurland05b_144.024_7.14.wav_ASR	so that don't tell on my wife i didn't see it to my wife uh the rest of the spongy
kurland05b_151.185_2.78.wav_ASR	and uh you know that night i went to the other end of the room
kurland05b_153.981_3.23.wav_ASR	it's next
kurland05b_158.031_2.08.wav_ASR	well like normal
kurland05b_161.057_5.69.wav_ASR	and uh draw it to the word because my right side was affected
kurland05b_166.826_2.53.wav_ASR	yeah that's right
kurland05b_169.989_2.67.wav_ASR	you kept dropping out the
kurland05b_173.568_4.83.wav_ASR	um i got a mass pike from splinters
kurland05b_179.316_1.64.wav_ASR	and it keep going over the rubber
kurland05b_182.108_9.76.wav_ASR	and then i i no it's just have something on my my speech and you know
kurland05b_191.892_5.03.wav_ASR	so i uh i picked up some corner c. d. that i saw these two parameters
kurland05b_196.973_3.33.wav_ASR	and uh i got the corporate on my desk
kurland05b_200.538_0.84.wav_ASR	forties
kurland05b_201.657_1.03.wav_ASR	they can't get back
kurland05b_203.698_3.23.wav_ASR	and then i got up and uh whistle
kurland05b_207.883_1.73.wav_ASR	it's on the c. d. k. i. k. i. k.
kurland05b_210.089_2.3.wav_ASR	it's the same thing happening down there
kurland05b_212.464_1.61.wav_ASR	it's going on the right
kurland05b_215.133_5.91.wav_ASR	downs are going to go up on the side
kurland05b_221.891_4.39.wav_ASR	at that point
kurland05b_226.335_2.1.wav_ASR	so i uh
kurland05b_229.055_2.63.wav_ASR	and about twelve o'clock yeah that's wrong
kurland05b_231.708_2.62.wav_ASR	oh
kurland05b_234.375_2.94.wav_ASR	the phone ring
kurland05b_237.33_1.8.wav_ASR	oh
kurland05b_239.747_1.31.wav_ASR	yeah
kurland05b_241.287_2.06.wav_ASR	my wife just like twelve year old
kurland05b_244.599_0.87.wav_ASR	yeah
kurland05b_245.491_5.89.wav_ASR	well i s i think it's a low and maybe more towards the other side
kurland05b_251.454_3.41.wav_ASR	oh well the person won't mind
kurland05b_256.869_0.559.wav_ASR	it was right
kurland05b_258.3_6.88.wav_ASR	oh well the person on the other side
kurland05b_266.088_0.42.wav_ASR	sh
kurland05b_266.653_0.63.wav_ASR	think you have to show
kurland05b_267.375_0.45.wav_ASR	so
kurland05b_268.156_0.55.wav_ASR	it's a rabbit
kurland05b_268.782_0.81.wav_ASR	so
kurland05b_269.867_0.57.wav_ASR	here we are
kurland05b_271.723_3.86.wav_ASR	yeah my wife was the problem
kurland05b_275.899_1.1.wav_ASR	so we went to the atlas
kurland05b_277.016_4.1.wav_ASR	um yeah
kurland05b_281.136_4.44.wav_ASR	but it was over three years so the cap is already on the bad
kurland05b_293.567_4.82.wav_ASR	well that would be speech stereo and
kurland05b_298.403_8.73.wav_ASR	yeah the the p. t. and uh the uh the electronics
kurland05b_307.193_2.73.wav_ASR	yeah
kurland05b_310.082_0.64.wav_ASR	okay
kurland05b_310.745_2.93.wav_ASR	yeah
kurland05b_313.825_2.57.wav_ASR	you remember that
kurland05b_318.388_3.05.wav_ASR	oh it's got better than my right hand
kurland05b_321.457_1.7.wav_ASR	it's
kurland05b_323.705_0.63.wav_ASR	yeah
kurland05b_324.657_3.95.wav_ASR	and then the speech recognition must be three months
kurland05b_333.208_9.89.wav_ASR	yeah it's like a three when i started
kurland05b_343.549_1.79.wav_ASR	yeah it's a kind of flat top
kurland05b_346.177_4.96.wav_ASR	and that's that that that time there uh yeah
kurland05b_352.43_0.71.wav_ASR	you place it
kurland05b_353.164_2.95.wav_ASR	yeah so
kurland05b_356.174_4.04.wav_ASR	oh
kurland05b_360.291_2.51.wav_ASR	you know i never got my speech fully back
kurland05b_370.449_0.36.wav_ASR	yeah
kurland05b_373.581_7.66.wav_ASR	it's it's uh it's better but i don't feel it's uh it's better
kurland05b_381.259_2.16.wav_ASR	oh right
kurland05b_383.436_2.84.wav_ASR	yeah it's you know it will tell jokes and
kurland05b_386.57_0.47.wav_ASR	oh no
kurland05b_387.861_3.22.wav_ASR	yeah i i was pretty good at the drawing
kurland05b_391.097_4.98.wav_ASR	yeah it's i'd be more proud of the company
kurland05b_396.1_1.46.wav_ASR	or
kurland05b_401.115_6.28.wav_ASR	let's see yeah after i had the straw i continued to work s 'cause my ear and nose
kurland05b_408.444_4.29.wav_ASR	and uh i want to uh
kurland05b_413.53_1.25.wav_ASR	so
kurland05b_414.87_1.34.wav_ASR	it's it's a giraffe
kurland05b_416.983_7.74.wav_ASR	and anyway uh they had a they had a glass on the cordless and the cordless you know talking about
kurland05b_425.712_2.42.wav_ASR	they always uh the guy has to be quick
kurland05b_428.562_3.89.wav_ASR	and they could answer all my pearies you know
kurland05b_432.845_1.68.wav_ASR	and
kurland05b_435.581_2.4.wav_ASR	yeah
kurland05b_438.0_1.17.wav_ASR	yeah it's really impressive
kurland05b_440.451_5.79.wav_ASR	yeah i i don't guess much as uh as you said
kurland05b_448.71_3.71.wav_ASR	just the t. v. you know like the t. v.
kurland05b_453.297_5.68.wav_ASR	so i don't think it's a curve curved of course
kurland05b_459.001_5.15.wav_ASR	yeah i one of the three people that i work with
kurland05b_465.42_4.07.wav_ASR	and they're done a long time ago
kurland05b_470.732_2.86.wav_ASR	yeah that's the third time i've taken the test
kurland05b_473.683_3.87.wav_ASR	and you know s some of the people that were there for french time only
kurland05b_478.908_4.73.wav_ASR	so again it's it's not the same as the same as the same as the same
kurland05b_486.315_0.97.wav_ASR	but you don't
kurland05b_487.3_0.41.wav_ASR	so
kurland05b_521.35_5.4.wav_ASR	yeah
kurland05b_528.086_12.14.wav_ASR	when i say it's a little kid so it's probably what eight euros old seventy two euros
kurland05b_541.171_8.04.wav_ASR	and anyway it's uh it was uh s some kind of contrast uh put on by some western t. v. show
kurland05b_549.936_8.21.wav_ASR	and anyway i want to strip for uh myself and my two parents to uh friday town
kurland05b_558.463_2.43.wav_ASR	it won't work
kurland05b_562.292_2.8.wav_ASR	yeah
kurland05b_565.11_1.13.wav_ASR	but
kurland05b_566.959_0.5.wav_ASR	we got it
kurland05b_567.474_5.55.wav_ASR	and uh the guy that was our our guy
kurland05b_573.948_2.22.wav_ASR	yeah
kurland05b_577.382_0.79.wav_ASR	oh no
kurland05b_578.302_2.27.wav_ASR	okay
kurland05b_582.487_1.86.wav_ASR	yeah
kurland05b_584.365_5.0.wav_ASR	in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the
kurland05b_589.647_1.44.wav_ASR	yeah
kurland05b_591.776_2.55.wav_ASR	like that's a that's a long time ago though
kurland05b_624.232_0.39.wav_ASR	okay
kurland05b_628.176_4.47.wav_ASR	well little guy's playing soccer or kick ball on the front yeah
kurland05b_632.7_2.8.wav_ASR	and he clicks the ball
kurland05b_635.545_6.32.wav_ASR	and unfortunately it goes through the window uh either his house or his neighbour's house
kurland05b_642.769_3.78.wav_ASR	it's in the in the uh
kurland05b_646.929_1.83.wav_ASR	now it's a lamp
kurland05b_649.915_2.18.wav_ASR	and the guy
kurland05b_653.528_0.75.wav_ASR	jo's cut
kurland05b_655.706_1.96.wav_ASR	um he looks awesome
kurland05b_657.905_0.67.wav_ASR	it's on the wall
kurland05b_658.598_2.16.wav_ASR	oh
kurland05b_661.683_0.79.wav_ASR	chill is it's true
kurland05b_675.398_0.57.wav_ASR	oh right
kurland05b_688.437_3.84.wav_ASR	well again
kurland05b_692.452_0.73.wav_ASR	and
kurland05b_693.436_0.72.wav_ASR	yeah
kurland05b_694.205_1.17.wav_ASR	it's
kurland05b_696.756_1.71.wav_ASR	oh no it's it's gonna be fine
kurland05b_698.991_1.28.wav_ASR	it's a rabbit
kurland05b_701.547_4.48.wav_ASR	and that's right on this agreement as well
kurland05b_707.255_1.58.wav_ASR	it's a giraffe
kurland05b_709.681_0.62.wav_ASR	you can call
kurland05b_710.322_2.75.wav_ASR	and
kurland05b_713.094_1.1.wav_ASR	it's my score
kurland05b_714.345_3.63.wav_ASR	next time you go s scroll it
kurland05b_744.592_1.132.wav_ASR	yeah
kurland05b_755.253_4.52.wav_ASR	well a little girls probably yeah
kurland05b_759.794_2.18.wav_ASR	oh
kurland05b_761.996_4.72.wav_ASR	and the dog uh changes the cat up a tree
kurland05b_768.041_7.81.wav_ASR	and then uh their father or some older gentleman tried to get the cat down from the tree
kurland05b_776.416_4.18.wav_ASR	and anyway it's the later falls down on the the tree so he stuck too
kurland05b_781.781_5.59.wav_ASR	then the fire battery's come in with the second ladder and the cat down and the cat down
kurland05b_796.879_0.58.wav_ASR	oh no
kurland05b_803.106_0.41.wav_ASR	yeah
kurland05b_807.665_0.38.wav_ASR	yeah
kurland05b_815.154_0.57.wav_ASR	okay
kurland05b_909.402_3.36.wav_ASR	once upon a time there was a giraffe
kurland05b_913.675_7.88.wav_ASR	sho you're two seconds not very good in the end though
kurland05b_922.524_6.82.wav_ASR	and uh there's a a ball or something
kurland05b_930.118_7.16.wav_ASR	and uh the the mister and uh two girls went to the ball
kurland05b_938.355_5.11.wav_ASR	and they told them all to stay the flowers 'cause it's they're all dead
kurland05b_945.465_0.99.wav_ASR	standard
kurland05b_946.474_3.95.wav_ASR	um and uh somehow she found the
kurland05b_950.444_4.35.wav_ASR	or something
kurland05b_955.569_3.66.wav_ASR	and she got
kurland05b_960.256_15.48.wav_ASR	and uh in yeah in go to the bowl she uh took it out of the bowl so
kurland05b_976.988_3.15.wav_ASR	yeah
kurland05b_981.967_7.69.wav_ASR	it's it's the the target to a part of the the the target t to a part of the ping
kurland05b_991.035_2.82.wav_ASR	so i have me me me a time zone no
kurland05b_994.22_9.66.wav_ASR	yeah so she uh talked about the ball before mid night so she wouldn't turn into a p uh into a pump again
kurland05b_1004.309_1.67.wav_ASR	and i guess you lost the slider
kurland05b_1006.874_2.58.wav_ASR	well she was there she was dancing with the hands
kurland05b_1009.716_4.87.wav_ASR	and they were the price
kurland05b_1014.608_2.97.wav_ASR	oh i like it more or less

MSU02a_65.516_4.981.wav_ASR	so um i said maybe i should take a shower and it's better right
MSU02a_70.551_2.69.wav_ASR	and i had uh i live upstairs from my mother
MSU02a_73.678_1.09.wav_ASR	and i went to my mom
MSU02a_75.305_1.33.wav_ASR	something is wrong with my mind
MSU02a_76.658_0.34.wav_ASR	my s
MSU02a_77.446_2.66.wav_ASR	maybe i have to go to the doctor or something
MSU02a_80.377_1.81.wav_ASR	so i called my doctor
MSU02a_82.551_4.64.wav_ASR	and uh that point i was not talking as good
MSU02a_87.659_4.23.wav_ASR	and and i hung up with my doctor because i she couldn't get on the phone
MSU02a_92.286_1.38.wav_ASR	so i hung up my doctor
MSU02a_93.731_1.4.wav_ASR	and my sister lives out there
MSU02a_95.416_0.4.wav_ASR	and i see
MSU02a_96.544_1.83.wav_ASR	you better take me to the household
MSU02a_98.965_1.55.wav_ASR	something is wrong with my arm
MSU02a_100.924_7.48.wav_ASR	and by the time she took me to the um by the time she took me to the household
MSU02a_108.856_1.62.wav_ASR	and
MSU02a_110.565_1.91.wav_ASR	got to hack and scratch right away
MSU02a_112.852_3.26.wav_ASR	um i think i had the stroke
MSU02a_123.733_4.639.wav_ASR	um the first thing i did was go to celsius
MSU02a_128.638_2.54.wav_ASR	and i had w i was in the household for a week
MSU02a_131.907_5.81.wav_ASR	and um i remember the thing when i was in the hospital i couldn't talk
MSU02a_138.154_1.77.wav_ASR	and i said only thing i
MSU02a_140.135_1.02.wav_ASR	two two two two
MSU02a_141.455_3.21.wav_ASR	and uh a friend came to visit me at night
MSU02a_145.253_5.76.wav_ASR	and and i was i was i was um standing around
MSU02a_151.366_4.42.wav_ASR	and and i was telling him i couldn't tell
MSU02a_155.806_0.33.wav_ASR	i said
MSU02a_156.33_0.73.wav_ASR	two two two two two
MSU02a_157.657_1.92.wav_ASR	and finally i raised up my arm
MSU02a_160.1_0.87.wav_ASR	hi can't talk
MSU02a_161.035_3.83.wav_ASR	that was the first thing the first thing i said to somebody
MSU02a_164.93_2.23.wav_ASR	it's it was like a wednesday or thursday
MSU02a_167.761_7.16.wav_ASR	and when i got home um right away i knew a speech therapist
MSU02a_175.714_5.37.wav_ASR	and um right away i started with speech theory before i went to the caseter
MSU02a_181.526_3.49.wav_ASR	and i was in caroline uh one week before um
MSU02a_185.36_9.53.wav_ASR	when i got to the hodgeball um when i had got from the hodgeball i was in one week before i went to celsius
MSU02a_195.305_4.99.wav_ASR	and she would come over like two times for m. speech therapy
MSU02a_200.605_8.65.wav_ASR	and i had um my friends every day would cards with me th so i could speak better
MSU02a_209.651_1.44.wav_ASR	and i went to celsius
MSU02a_211.142_6.83.wav_ASR	and um they help me to be better i think
MSU02a_218.666_0.39.wav_ASR	yeah
MSU02a_219.114_1.21.wav_ASR	don't know
MSU02a_228.863_0.86.wav_ASR	oh i don't like yeah
MSU02a_232.0_4.72.wav_ASR	oh no i am a target
MSU02a_236.74_3.71.wav_ASR	and and and diantha diantha
MSU02a_241.038_0.84.wav_ASR	oh my god
MSU02a_254.571_2.359.wav_ASR	um i don't have any
MSU02a_257.7_1.819.wav_ASR	one of the Happiest times of my life
MSU02a_259.94_1.731.wav_ASR	or i don't have any children
MSU02a_261.998_3.54.wav_ASR	and um my sister doesn't have any children
MSU02a_265.858_6.68.wav_ASR	and i had um my a greatest thing was uh a a god's child for
MSU02a_273.336_1.84.wav_ASR	that was the perfect thing for
MSU02a_276.24_1.13.wav_ASR	hi low
MSU02a_281.31_7.54.wav_ASR	um she is um she is um a s a s a singer in cologne
MSU02a_289.24_6.71.wav_ASR	and she wants to be um a physical um not a physical therapy uh or a therapeutic therapy
MSU02a_296.365_5.22.wav_ASR	so i said if i had the stroke and she was occupational therapy i would go to her
MSU02a_301.811_1.72.wav_ASR	but i think i'm better now
MSU02a_342.828_5.08.wav_ASR	um the bo um the boy was um kicking a soccer ball
MSU02a_348.299_3.67.wav_ASR	and the softer ball went into his neighbours' window
MSU02a_352.388_10.89.wav_ASR	and um he was the the number was stuck when he was um he was shocked that the ball went into the living room
MSU02a_363.592_6.78.wav_ASR	and um the boy w um the man was looking um who kicked the soccer ball
MSU02a_372.51_0.57.wav_ASR	it's okay
MSU02a_376.18_2.0.wav_ASR	and you know you're not gonna tell me but
MSU02a_392.46_10.41.wav_ASR	um oh um the boy was going to scroll
MSU02a_402.978_1.02.wav_ASR	and his mother said
MSU02a_404.421_4.06.wav_ASR	you better bring an elephant because um in my range
MSU02a_408.549_3.2.wav_ASR	and and the the boy said to his mother
MSU02a_412.108_1.36.wav_ASR	or i don't need an infrared
MSU02a_414.681_1.26.wav_ASR	because he's a wolf
MSU02a_415.964_1.0.wav_ASR	doesn't have a remote
MSU02a_417.371_2.01.wav_ASR	and he wanted to scroll
MSU02a_419.405_1.49.wav_ASR	and it's started to run
MSU02a_421.271_2.9.wav_ASR	and he was getting uh drained with the rain
MSU02a_424.496_1.48.wav_ASR	and his mother says
MSU02a_426.478_1.86.wav_ASR	uh you better take an elephant now
MSU02a_428.404_0.63.wav_ASR	you came home
MSU02a_429.355_1.05.wav_ASR	and uh he's
MSU02a_430.614_1.58.wav_ASR	you better take an umbrella now
MSU02a_432.488_4.65.wav_ASR	and um uh and he went to school with the engineers
MSU02a_454.059_7.1.wav_ASR	um um oh but i don't understand this one
MSU02a_461.459_4.5.wav_ASR	alright well b i i beginning and middle and end
MSU02a_466.275_5.72.wav_ASR	um the b um the the girl lost their cat
MSU02a_472.305_1.08.wav_ASR	he was up in a tree
MSU02a_474.081_6.55.wav_ASR	and their father or was some man went to get the cat from the tree
MSU02a_480.742_2.81.wav_ASR	and he got he couldn't get down
MSU02a_484.241_7.44.wav_ASR	so um so the finder track had to come and rescue the man and rescue the cat
MSU02a_493.822_1.63.wav_ASR	you didn't mention the dog but i don't
MSU02a_582.049_4.03.wav_ASR	um the name of the book is cinderella
MSU02a_586.227_7.81.wav_ASR	and um um cinderella is um the daughter of somebody who the
MSU02a_594.721_1.23.wav_ASR	yeah
MSU02a_596.594_9.19.wav_ASR	senior uh she was the daughter of um somebody who was going to get married
MSU02a_605.801_0.93.wav_ASR	the the ha
MSU02a_610.21_5.17.wav_ASR	she's the daughter of uh and person who
MSU02a_615.428_4.21.wav_ASR	but her father wanted to get married okay
MSU02a_620.14_3.42.wav_ASR	and and silver is the the um his the daughter
MSU02a_623.963_5.23.wav_ASR	and he was going to marry um a s um a m uh stepmother
MSU02a_629.585_6.65.wav_ASR	and the stepmother had two sisters two um two uh daughters
MSU02a_636.791_3.04.wav_ASR	and um they got married
MSU02a_640.058_9.78.wav_ASR	and anderson uh was the step mother was very n um not nice to sandra
MSU02a_650.502_5.96.wav_ASR	so um they should s send it to a switzerland had a switch and do everything
MSU02a_656.484_9.57.wav_ASR	and to do the the um uh the um do the um how work in everything
MSU02a_666.071_2.01.wav_ASR	and a ball came out
MSU02a_668.493_6.77.wav_ASR	and the s the s the mother the directors of the the boards of the the boarders of the ball
MSU02a_675.638_7.35.wav_ASR	and and cinderella couldn't go because um the stepmother said she couldn't go
MSU02a_683.318_8.31.wav_ASR	so um uh all of a sudden a female godmother came in and um said to the cinderella she could go to the ball
MSU02a_691.908_10.64.wav_ASR	and it was a a beautiful um uh grand that she had and a beautiful um uh uh a carry that she had
MSU02a_703.078_1.84.wav_ASR	and she went to the bowl
MSU02a_705.22_3.63.wav_ASR	and um she made up the print charging
MSU02a_709.288_4.85.wav_ASR	and um but it would at twelve o'clock she had to be home
MSU02a_714.533_2.94.wav_ASR	and she lost the glass slider on our way home
MSU02a_717.834_16.39.wav_ASR	and um the um the print timer went to all the town to see what um to see what um who could fit the glass lid
MSU02a_734.506_2.63.wav_ASR	and cinderella was there
MSU02a_738.413_0.85.wav_ASR	and done with that
MSU02a_739.502_1.4.wav_ASR	um
MSU02a_740.924_0.72.wav_ASR	oh right
MSU02a_742.527_2.65.wav_ASR	oh no
MSU02a_745.822_1.76.wav_ASR	oh no
MSU02a_748.396_1.7.wav_ASR	oh my god
MSU02a_750.214_2.37.wav_ASR	you're you're going to tell me great fruit
MSU02a_752.608_0.72.wav_ASR	yeah
MSU02a_753.498_1.28.wav_ASR	oh
MSU02a_755.173_1.49.wav_ASR	oh my god
MSU02a_759.135_1.07.wav_ASR	oh okay good
MSU02a_764.101_5.27.wav_ASR	um i have to two two pieces of bread
MSU02a_770.144_2.1.wav_ASR	and you get the pen up button
MSU02a_773.087_1.46.wav_ASR	and you put it on the red
MSU02a_774.719_0.82.wav_ASR	oh that's a great idea
MSU02a_775.588_1.05.wav_ASR	and you put it on the br
MSU02a_776.656_3.2.wav_ASR	and and stick it together
MSU02a_779.877_1.29.wav_ASR	and you have a scale
MSU02a_783.584_1.29.wav_ASR	oh my god
MSU02a_786.256_1.19.wav_ASR	oh my god
MSU02b_15.115_5.1.wav_ASR	um uh sometimes it's okay
MSU02b_20.23_1.37.wav_ASR	and sometimes it's not
MSU02b_21.68_7.42.wav_ASR	um i think when i um if i know the people that i'm talking to it's it's okay
MSU02b_29.562_12.04.wav_ASR	um um when i get in a pressure situation when i have to um um i had to talk on the phone it's not too good
MSU02b_42.089_3.2.wav_ASR	so i tell people right away i had a stroke
MSU02b_53.446_4.29.wav_ASR	um um i worked up in the morning
MSU02b_58.037_4.73.wav_ASR	and um it was like seven thirty or something
MSU02b_63.18_4.51.wav_ASR	and um my i was a niting
MSU02b_68.573_3.41.wav_ASR	but i really don't need but i was trying to do it
MSU02b_72.304_3.89.wav_ASR	and um uh my arm got numb
MSU02b_76.83_2.66.wav_ASR	and um i said something's wrong
MSU02b_79.51_1.37.wav_ASR	and it's like volume and sleep
MSU02b_80.93_1.84.wav_ASR	you said something's wrong with my arm you know
MSU02b_83.156_4.03.wav_ASR	so um so i live down streets from uh live up there s
MSU02b_87.381_1.19.wav_ASR	my mother lives
MSU02b_89.04_1.36.wav_ASR	are we have a two family house
MSU02b_90.781_5.54.wav_ASR	and i live um um i i'm in the top floor
MSU02b_96.87_0.91.wav_ASR	and it's the other side
MSU02b_97.8_1.0.wav_ASR	what do you call that
MSU02b_98.847_0.47.wav_ASR	under
MSU02b_99.447_0.44.wav_ASR	over
MSU02b_102.276_2.1.wav_ASR	but i live over her or under her
MSU02b_105.897_0.39.wav_ASR	yes
MSU02b_107.198_0.35.wav_ASR	yeah
MSU02b_108.192_0.96.wav_ASR	uh oh dear
MSU02b_109.959_0.57.wav_ASR	oh right
MSU02b_111.83_1.15.wav_ASR	that's a problem for me
MSU02b_114.711_4.59.wav_ASR	so um so um so i said to my mother i
MSU02b_119.403_1.19.wav_ASR	something's wrong with my
MSU02b_121.06_0.65.wav_ASR	you don't know

MSU02b_123.31_3.19.wav_ASR	and by the time i took a shower i said
MSU02b_126.583_1.36.wav_ASR	maybe i have to go to the hardware
MSU02b_128.035_1.099.wav_ASR	so i took a shower
MSU02b_129.4_1.25.wav_ASR	and my really arm

MSU02b_143.642_6.96.wav_ASR	but um my hand was was um um parallelised l little bit
MSU02b_151.034_1.67.wav_ASR	and these three fingers
MSU02b_152.9_3.09.wav_ASR	and um and i couldn't talk anymore
MSU02b_156.046_3.59.wav_ASR	and and i don't know what they did because um
MSU02b_160.6_5.82.wav_ASR	they know that they um maybe to blend um for blending
MSU02b_167.009_1.47.wav_ASR	th i didn't have that period
MSU02b_168.531_2.04.wav_ASR	yeah i i had um a clock
MSU02b_171.21_3.25.wav_ASR	and i was i got to hong kong station
MSU02b_175.064_8.47.wav_ASR	and um uh um they sent me to mountain high because i had an anxiety
MSU02b_184.127_4.15.wav_ASR	and my doctor is out at mo mounts
MSU02b_188.292_2.45.wav_ASR	so they pushed me to mount sign
MSU02b_190.789_4.6.wav_ASR	and i was in the center of the uh a couple of days
MSU02b_196.738_0.86.wav_ASR	did you want to
MSU02b_198.693_0.69.wav_ASR	it's okay
MSU02b_207.675_4.16.wav_ASR	um i was in the household for one week
MSU02b_212.128_3.23.wav_ASR	and that next week i was home
MSU02b_215.724_4.5.wav_ASR	um but i've had friends that came over
MSU02b_220.246_3.59.wav_ASR	and they they knew i have a problem with the speaking
MSU02b_224.293_4.2.wav_ASR	and they right away try to help with speaking
MSU02b_228.877_9.82.wav_ASR	um the little card that you get for for kids you know that the a. is for apple and whatever and all all the time do that for one week
MSU02b_239.05_4.78.wav_ASR	and then i went to um um catherine
MSU02b_244.327_4.25.wav_ASR	and um i started with with speech theory
MSU02b_248.774_2.99.wav_ASR	and i started with acoustic theory
MSU02b_252.311_13.37.wav_ASR	and um i was there from germany until um uh um six months um june
MSU02b_266.095_2.2.wav_ASR	and i was there until june
MSU02b_268.649_2.44.wav_ASR	and then i was very forward
MSU02b_271.109_1.53.wav_ASR	uh i started writing
MSU02b_273.138_1.02.wav_ASR	um for a monkey
MSU02b_274.924_4.0.wav_ASR	well we didn't have to wait 'cause somebody had um didn't come
MSU02b_279.049_2.6.wav_ASR	and i filled the uh swahili
MSU02b_281.788_1.43.wav_ASR	so i didn't have to wait
MSU02b_283.589_0.71.wav_ASR	so it was good
MSU02b_314.213_3.96.wav_ASR	uh i w i was uh very ordered to be uh a good man
MSU02b_318.193_2.8.wav_ASR	or i don't have any um children of my own
MSU02b_321.013_1.62.wav_ASR	um my sister doesn't have any children
MSU02b_322.65_5.06.wav_ASR	so i was i was very ordered to be um a godmother
MSU02b_328.044_1.48.wav_ASR	and she's played it a dozen
MSU02b_329.755_1.23.wav_ASR	it's it's g okay
MSU02b_355.711_4.78.wav_ASR	um um the boy is kicking a soccer ball
MSU02b_360.827_4.59.wav_ASR	and it goes into um the uh the neighbourhoods window
MSU02b_365.855_8.3.wav_ASR	and um uh he go the the number um sees the soccer ball going into his living room
MSU02b_374.46_5.58.wav_ASR	and he looks and um and sees who uh kicked the soccer ball
MSU02b_380.259_1.17.wav_ASR	but he doesn't find out
MSU02b_402.414_6.03.wav_ASR	um um the b um the little boy is telling his mother
MSU02b_408.583_3.26.wav_ASR	you don't need an embedded to go to scroll i think
MSU02b_412.292_1.6.wav_ASR	and um the matter said
MSU02b_414.027_1.25.wav_ASR	you have to take an angle
MSU02b_415.678_2.76.wav_ASR	but the the um boys said
MSU02b_418.865_2.84.wav_ASR	or i don't want uh an opener
MSU02b_422.04_1.46.wav_ASR	and he goes to school
MSU02b_423.517_1.25.wav_ASR	and it starts to rain
MSU02b_424.786_2.46.wav_ASR	and and a big range store
MSU02b_427.355_1.48.wav_ASR	and the mother comes
MSU02b_429.035_4.2.wav_ASR	um and the boy goes back to the mother and says
MSU02b_434.17_7.48.wav_ASR	you should have um i should have listened to you
MSU02b_442.018_6.53.wav_ASR	and um and he um goes back for um the embedded
MSU02b_467.539_6.92.wav_ASR	um um um the b uh the girl lost her cat
MSU02b_474.94_5.85.wav_ASR	and um maybe her father wanted to get the cat um for her
MSU02b_481.428_1.57.wav_ASR	oh but he got in the tree
MSU02b_483.051_8.31.wav_ASR	and um he he couldn't get further um further to get the cat
MSU02b_491.782_2.46.wav_ASR	so the they had to call the farmer
MSU02b_494.288_9.28.wav_ASR	and the fibre man um the fibre man had to go to get the cat and rescue the man i guess
MSU02b_589.06_12.78.wav_ASR	um there was um uh there was um there was um there was um a giraffe named giraffe
MSU02b_602.256_5.65.wav_ASR	and her uh her uh father was getting remarried
MSU02b_608.558_10.76.wav_ASR	and um when she got he got married there uh two s he's had two stepisters two step double doors dur
MSU02b_620.174_6.44.wav_ASR	and um the m the step s brother didn't like sensor
MSU02b_626.962_13.49.wav_ASR	and she made him she um they made him they made her um do all of the um the uh the uh house work
MSU02b_643.434_3.73.wav_ASR	and um finally of ball came around
MSU02b_647.62_4.78.wav_ASR	and all the the step pointers were going to the ball
MSU02b_652.744_3.27.wav_ASR	and cinderella couldn't go because she had too much to do
MSU02b_656.402_8.18.wav_ASR	and um uh very god mother um uh fair god mother came to her and
MSU02b_665.011_1.16.wav_ASR	you could go to the ball
MSU02b_666.28_2.5.wav_ASR	and she made a beautiful dress for her
MSU02b_669.149_6.44.wav_ASR	and she made um uh a coat with uh a sponge i think was
MSU02b_676.299_2.21.wav_ASR	and then they take it by the ball
MSU02b_678.816_1.46.wav_ASR	and she had beautiful time
MSU02b_680.625_2.81.wav_ASR	and it was going to be twelve or a quarter
MSU02b_683.457_2.43.wav_ASR	and the girl had to be home by twelve o'clock
MSU02b_686.262_6.34.wav_ASR	and when she got home um uh she lost the slider
MSU02b_693.113_7.32.wav_ASR	and um the the the price n um s had a beautiful time with our
MSU02b_700.825_6.52.wav_ASR	and um uh the press um wanted to find that girl
MSU02b_707.93_3.05.wav_ASR	so uh he wooked all over the town
MSU02b_711.29_2.7.wav_ASR	and and he finally found her
MSU02b_714.38_3.07.wav_ASR	and because the sloping fiver fit
MSU02b_717.999_2.14.wav_ASR	and um then they got married
MSU02b_721.277_1.61.wav_ASR	and let's have happily ever after
MSU02b_731.651_2.25.wav_ASR	you have two pieces of red
MSU02b_734.63_5.09.wav_ASR	and um um two pieces of red
MSU02b_740.032_6.15.wav_ASR	and you uh get um pin number
MSU02b_747.082_1.97.wav_ASR	and you have get ready
MSU02b_749.49_1.24.wav_ASR	and stick it together
MSU02b_751.149_2.74.wav_ASR	and you have a pen battery and a jelly sandwich
MSU07a_18.011_0.54.wav_ASR	better
MSU07a_19.415_0.59.wav_ASR	usually
MSU07a_20.05_1.27.wav_ASR	oh my god
MSU07a_21.93_3.02.wav_ASR	i remember i can i couldn't speak
MSU07a_26.0_0.75.wav_ASR	oh no
MSU07a_30.5_1.01.wav_ASR	now real
MSU07a_34.678_1.4.wav_ASR	beagle
MSU07a_37.955_7.0.wav_ASR	um i remember th um i was at like a half popper
MSU07a_45.8_0.74.wav_ASR	yeah
MSU07a_46.76_1.02.wav_ASR	and they came
MSU07a_47.8_2.74.wav_ASR	and i didn't know what happen
MSU07a_50.6_1.58.wav_ASR	just blank
MSU07a_53.766_11.21.wav_ASR	and then a hasty kind of the up and um hell's capital
MSU07a_65.08_12.93.wav_ASR	and then um the um oh man oh man oh man they came to save the day
MSU07a_78.213_0.7.wav_ASR	oh yeah
MSU07a_78.963_0.59.wav_ASR	don't know
MSU07a_81.0_2.42.wav_ASR	yeah but um the building
MSU07a_83.98_8.6.wav_ASR	and it was in i was in um
MSU07a_94.541_1.71.wav_ASR	ah a half
MSU07a_96.535_0.41.wav_ASR	yeah
MSU07a_98.406_2.57.wav_ASR	and i was there for a little bit
MSU07a_101.36_0.85.wav_ASR	the time
MSU07a_103.12_0.5.wav_ASR	yeah
MSU07a_105.0_0.59.wav_ASR	yeah
MSU07a_115.076_5.09.wav_ASR	um i've been doing pretty good
MSU07a_120.621_0.49.wav_ASR	you know
MSU07a_127.359_1.44.wav_ASR	what are you doing on
MSU07a_130.961_7.49.wav_ASR	like um i know the battery room
MSU07a_138.53_4.39.wav_ASR	ike i at first i couldn't i couldn't do i couldn't do much
MSU07a_143.0_4.11.wav_ASR	i had to like be be helpful
MSU07a_148.218_2.45.wav_ASR	like a success or no
MSU07a_151.021_3.759.wav_ASR	but now i can do it by myself
MSU07a_155.146_0.36.wav_ASR	you know
MSU07a_156.4_0.41.wav_ASR	yeah
MSU07a_158.5_0.4.wav_ASR	yeah

71-1_29.979_4.84.wav_ASR	um i did uh a semester
71-1_38.11_8.87.wav_ASR	back in my generation which is what i did which is why it was nine months which is what i did which is why it was nine months
71-1_47.68_7.67.wav_ASR	um what i did when i got to copenhagen and we had this um arrangement which you could take classes at the university
71-1_56.18_2.36.wav_ASR	um for the first semester i took cl
71-1_59.16_2.453.wav_ASR	we had um classes for four days of the
71-1_61.8_1.661.wav_ASR	three days of the week we could
71-1_64.1_7.4.wav_ASR	the second message uh because i met this one who became my best friend and it was her idea uh she said
71-1_71.94_4.16.wav_ASR	you know we are our aggression is really holding us back
71-1_76.94_18.32.wav_ASR	um so i think what we should do is we should we should would draw on the interface menu because we get most of it if you r we should draw the time triangle and then just spend the time travelling
71-1_95.93_13.06.wav_ASR	so i would say for those four months in which i actually had a database room that i could go back to when i needed to decompress and i got a higher
71-1_110.29_3.419.wav_ASR	uh remotes as far as we go
71-1_113.771_4.08.wav_ASR	iddly frankly um sparkling
71-1_119.131_2.676.wav_ASR	um we spent a fair amount of time trying all over
71-1_121.911_2.231.wav_ASR	when your ninety it's a really good time to travel
71-1_124.491_2.854.wav_ASR	um really good looking boys everywhere that you go
71-1_127.345_11.955.wav_ASR	and yeah i just had i just had the most incredible um large vocabulary um dispensed the fact that my mother said
71-1_139.525_1.2.wav_ASR	stuffing out a scroll
71-1_140.804_1.257.wav_ASR	oh that's terrible
71-1_142.165_0.882.wav_ASR	you don't know
71-1_143.59_1.381.wav_ASR	oh no i'll go back next
71-1_144.971_4.28.wav_ASR	oh but this is my opportunity to really tackle a
71-1_149.791_2.56.wav_ASR	yeah as my friend mael said to me
71-1_153.351_1.62.wav_ASR	parameters are back in
71-1_155.291_0.913.wav_ASR	what are they gonna do
71-1_156.204_0.947.wav_ASR	we're in code
71-1_157.791_1.89.wav_ASR	we're just gonna talk about what we're doing
71-1_160.22_5.0.wav_ASR	so i could tell you other stories but they would probably sensor
71-1_165.44_2.1.wav_ASR	so we won't go to all the details
71-1_174.46_3.52.wav_ASR	it's said it was original uh because i met my dad
71-1_178.1_6.44.wav_ASR	mythical um my father's family was only two generations from the indigenous to the indigenous
71-1_184.94_5.88.wav_ASR	they're in um round stone which is in the western kind of gold
71-1_191.32_5.02.wav_ASR	and so i actually meet with uh other customers
71-1_196.572_2.608.wav_ASR	that's true what the exact relationship is
71-1_199.432_1.95.wav_ASR	but i met people that were part of my family
71-1_201.692_7.006.wav_ASR	and i'd blocks or a second or third kinds that looked exactly like my father and my grandparents
71-1_209.352_4.804.wav_ASR	oh yeah that was the most important i think yeah
71-1_236.89_0.84.wav_ASR	it comes and goes
71-1_238.25_4.65.wav_ASR	um i would say that the main problem with my language is that it's unrelatable
71-1_243.73_5.13.wav_ASR	um i said a few minutes ago i was talking about going up
71-1_249.84_4.21.wav_ASR	and what is that it's the volumes that i have issues with
71-1_254.46_2.14.wav_ASR	yeah could not say a br
71-1_257.12_1.089.wav_ASR	you think i said a bro
71-1_258.58_0.629.wav_ASR	and then i said
71-1_259.68_6.89.wav_ASR	but i was really thinking in my brain how to walk around that or figure that out or s um feel that on my own
71-1_267.01_2.96.wav_ASR	and um kind of a issue with
71-1_270.27_1.84.wav_ASR	didn't anticipate that
71-1_272.61_2.16.wav_ASR	better than i was
71-1_275.11_5.22.wav_ASR	um i still have difficulty with complicated components
71-1_281.15_1.54.wav_ASR	um i'll still oh
71-1_282.906_4.581.wav_ASR	now that i have an always been confusing to other people
71-1_287.466_3.295.wav_ASR	you did remember back what it was like when i was pitching before the s
71-1_291.106_1.62.wav_ASR	people would look proud
71-1_293.566_0.577.wav_ASR	and it was
71-1_294.446_0.82.wav_ASR	that's their problem
71-1_295.586_5.857.wav_ASR	well they look puzzled um a lot of times i'm pretty sure it's because i said something that didn't make any sense
71-1_301.443_11.647.wav_ASR	so i'm still trying to work on explaining complicated things to people um and trying to correct myself when i make a mistake
71-1_313.523_6.04.wav_ASR	and i continue mis misp um on a regular base
71-1_319.736_1.86.wav_ASR	so it's frustrating
71-1_321.916_8.864.wav_ASR	um i keep protecting it to the point that many people don't think i have a phase uh until they do notice that i have a phase
71-1_331.276_5.44.wav_ASR	so i can communicate but not well and not the way that i used to be able to communicate
71-1_347.09_0.959.wav_ASR	oh very much
71-1_348.131_1.199.wav_ASR	yeah
71-1_350.191_0.82.wav_ASR	oh
71-1_357.66_4.863.wav_ASR	um well i didn't know that it was a stroke which is very tight
71-1_363.04_1.71.wav_ASR	oh
71-1_364.78_1.964.wav_ASR	so how would i know what a scroll wise
71-1_366.88_4.114.wav_ASR	um uh adaptable um uh working out
71-1_371.1_1.984.wav_ASR	it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's
71-1_373.42_4.0.wav_ASR	okay that was a day when i you know that's the day when the response's stopped
71-1_377.8_1.688.wav_ASR	oh no
71-1_379.52_2.533.wav_ASR	it needs to start working out again harder than i ben
71-1_382.16_0.893.wav_ASR	and
71-1_384.16_2.555.wav_ASR	and i worked the hell out and
71-1_386.84_1.385.wav_ASR	you mean i think i did eight
71-1_388.82_3.88.wav_ASR	my hard raid was up to like a hundred and seven
71-1_393.18_0.64.wav_ASR	okay
71-1_394.24_0.819.wav_ASR	we keep this off
71-1_395.34_2.9.wav_ASR	uh yeah i i wasn't time
71-1_398.62_0.92.wav_ASR	wasn't fudge
71-1_400.16_11.482.wav_ASR	and got off the laptop and had double vision and then divided i would walk for two more miles um mostly because the black panther was on
71-1_412.0_1.26.wav_ASR	oh
71-1_413.3_0.677.wav_ASR	but that was on
71-1_413.977_4.84.wav_ASR	and i thought i wanted to watch it because really like uh um chat with
71-1_419.837_1.766.wav_ASR	oh
71-1_422.137_2.144.wav_ASR	uh again i had double vision
71-1_425.157_2.023.wav_ASR	oh i just didn't feel good anymore
71-1_427.66_7.131.wav_ASR	um went home and had a thunder clap um on my right side
71-1_434.94_0.52.wav_ASR	and just say
71-1_435.94_1.381.wav_ASR	um no idea with that
71-1_437.76_2.145.wav_ASR	um so i crossed it
71-1_440.66_2.93.wav_ASR	the next day i couldn't work it on
71-1_443.78_1.7.wav_ASR	it's trying to write a conference report
71-1_445.86_0.64.wav_ASR	nothing would
71-1_446.77_1.3.wav_ASR	and i couldn't do
71-1_449.31_3.735.wav_ASR	so uh i want to get my head my head cut the next day
71-1_453.11_3.247.wav_ASR	and i wanted to canvas uh 'cause i had a really bad head idea
71-1_456.67_2.13.wav_ASR	but um if you cancel it you had to pay four
71-1_459.29_1.889.wav_ASR	and my hair will be cut
71-1_461.93_0.942.wav_ASR	oh i
71-1_462.93_1.662.wav_ASR	um i live alone
71-1_464.592_2.463.wav_ASR	so i hadn't really talked to anybody in two days
71-1_467.512_1.658.wav_ASR	or
71-1_469.572_2.734.wav_ASR	and i couldn't tell her how i wanted to get my hair cut
71-1_473.192_2.18.wav_ASR	uh i was i couldn't say
71-1_476.352_4.42.wav_ASR	um so i couldn't tell her that i'd been wearing swahili
71-1_481.512_1.76.wav_ASR	we couldn't i don't know what was coming
71-1_483.692_0.608.wav_ASR	that's right
71-1_484.66_2.06.wav_ASR	and she's like nasty it's smiling
71-1_486.78_1.691.wav_ASR	it's he had no idea what i was talking
71-1_489.8_0.46.wav_ASR	or
71-1_490.62_1.01.wav_ASR	it's something's wrong
71-1_492.54_1.8.wav_ASR	so i told her
71-1_494.62_0.3.wav_ASR	you said
71-1_495.129_0.678.wav_ASR	like your hair
71-1_497.02_2.56.wav_ASR	so she luckily she didn't have a higher head
71-1_499.94_1.89.wav_ASR	should she cut her hair the way i
71-1_502.08_0.3.wav_ASR	yeah
71-1_502.46_3.93.wav_ASR	so you don't bother to call a doctor because this doesn't make any sense
71-1_507.5_2.1.wav_ASR	so i i tried i
71-1_510.16_4.24.wav_ASR	and i think this is something that must happen with people that have strokes is that they
71-1_516.46_3.62.wav_ASR	look up the number that i was supposed to call original colour
71-1_520.22_1.589.wav_ASR	and this was already six
71-1_522.35_2.64.wav_ASR	and it had all these
71-1_526.21_3.46.wav_ASR	if it's an emergency emergency go call norman
71-1_530.13_0.33.wav_ASR	but
71-1_530.61_0.757.wav_ASR	that's
71-1_531.59_3.737.wav_ASR	um i'm just gonna point it out to the original client tomorrow morning
71-1_536.11_0.706.wav_ASR	um and then
71-1_537.11_3.2.wav_ASR	if it's this situation call um
71-1_540.703_4.014.wav_ASR	and if it's this situation call you know press three
71-1_545.023_2.16.wav_ASR	if it's this situation call
71-1_548.083_3.82.wav_ASR	apparently if you stayed on for two and a half minutes they'd finally say
71-1_552.343_1.811.wav_ASR	real person will come on the line
71-1_555.283_1.601.wav_ASR	but my head really hurt
71-1_557.243_0.593.wav_ASR	it's just goi
71-1_557.903_1.16.wav_ASR	well this is
71-1_559.46_2.24.wav_ASR	so i hung up the phone and so
71-1_561.9_1.13.wav_ASR	just get up tomorrow
71-1_563.38_2.36.wav_ASR	yeah i'll see if i anybody will answer the phone
71-1_566.68_1.06.wav_ASR	um
71-1_568.34_4.12.wav_ASR	and she she was very friendly
71-1_573.0_0.6.wav_ASR	teamwork
71-1_573.7_1.12.wav_ASR	don't sound like your self
71-1_576.13_1.22.wav_ASR	you need to go take an angle
71-1_577.9_1.29.wav_ASR	oh it's gonna pay for it
71-1_579.24_0.78.wav_ASR	that's right
71-1_580.52_1.22.wav_ASR	um
71-1_581.84_0.82.wav_ASR	just have a head
71-1_582.9_2.28.wav_ASR	but i don't want i don't want to spend that much money
71-1_586.02_6.16.wav_ASR	and she and her uh partner uh they called the fire department
71-1_592.48_0.8.wav_ASR	he's an animal
71-1_593.56_2.263.wav_ASR	she's just um finishing scroll up there
71-1_596.04_2.585.wav_ASR	it's she um they called the fire department in manchester
71-1_598.625_1.419.wav_ASR	and and they said
71-1_601.165_2.74.wav_ASR	technologically this is
71-1_604.725_1.16.wav_ASR	this is her
71-1_606.385_0.335.wav_ASR	and they
71-1_607.54_1.23.wav_ASR	it's sounds like she's having a s
71-1_609.285_2.315.wav_ASR	you needs to get to the h uh organization
71-1_613.76_1.04.wav_ASR	and and
71-1_614.845_1.205.wav_ASR	but she doesn't want to go
71-1_616.36_0.52.wav_ASR	and they said
71-1_616.96_5.542.wav_ASR	well i'm living on my you know it's i'm living on my ipod
71-1_623.14_4.643.wav_ASR	and i heard people running up the stairs outside my my apartment
71-1_628.28_4.927.wav_ASR	um um it's really good looking fireman by the way
71-1_633.62_2.12.wav_ASR	it i think it must be the university
71-1_636.04_0.645.wav_ASR	oh
71-1_637.365_1.928.wav_ASR	and i answered the door
71-1_639.285_1.265.wav_ASR	and i told them that
71-1_640.825_1.38.wav_ASR	oh i didn't have
71-1_642.545_1.252.wav_ASR	didn't know what was going on
71-1_644.165_1.173.wav_ASR	um i couldn't talk
71-1_646.805_1.205.wav_ASR	you need to come with us right now
71-1_648.285_0.355.wav_ASR	my s
71-1_648.745_0.913.wav_ASR	well no i'll take uh
71-1_650.705_0.335.wav_ASR	and they say
71-1_651.417_0.908.wav_ASR	you can't drive
71-1_653.105_1.585.wav_ASR	well i'm gonna go tomorrow to the
71-1_654.885_1.437.wav_ASR	now you're gonna go with this right now
71-1_656.32_0.62.wav_ASR	oh
71-1_657.32_0.817.wav_ASR	alright
71-1_658.28_2.28.wav_ASR	well let me get my coat and all the other
71-1_660.88_3.715.wav_ASR	all the sudden i got into the emergency room
71-1_664.74_1.961.wav_ASR	it was just this huge um
71-1_667.8_1.86.wav_ASR	it's raining around and yellow
71-1_670.22_6.1.wav_ASR	and um all the sudden uh they held me in for a a cat stand and came out and s
71-1_676.5_1.02.wav_ASR	yeah you had a straw
71-1_678.32_2.727.wav_ASR	so i asked the doctor
71-1_681.06_3.681.wav_ASR	and he showed me on the cat's hand exactly what it had
71-1_685.44_3.23.wav_ASR	and uh they edit it
71-1_689.38_2.962.wav_ASR	um so that's what i had to draw
71-1_692.75_6.56.wav_ASR	yeah i i really have had no issues with mice mouse peep
71-1_699.81_1.65.wav_ASR	by phone s
71-1_702.78_2.04.wav_ASR	um i just didn't know about the hardware
71-1_705.03_0.95.wav_ASR	never had one again
71-1_706.88_1.18.wav_ASR	but i never had one
71-1_708.53_7.93.wav_ASR	but apparently if you get a really bad headache that hits you on the side of the head it means you should probably go to the emergency room
71-1_717.45_2.54.wav_ASR	yeah i don't know if that gave you uh
71-1_720.582_1.363.wav_ASR	it doesn't give you a lot of insight
71-1_722.34_8.435.wav_ASR	again and i'd remember um right after i had the head set
71-1_731.3_3.77.wav_ASR	and point the window of opportunity had to
71-1_737.18_5.617.wav_ASR	but it wasn't a s a samic it was in a samic stroke not a germanic stroke
71-1_743.84_6.846.wav_ASR	and it they ultimately decided it was graphical because they'd be not been able to find out why i had it
71-1_751.22_7.24.wav_ASR	um i d all of my numbers are s medical numbers are good
71-1_758.94_0.8.wav_ASR	now
71-1_760.32_0.82.wav_ASR	uh i don't smoke
71-1_762.02_1.88.wav_ASR	um i have low blood pressure
71-1_764.42_2.25.wav_ASR	um everything looks
71-1_767.76_1.39.wav_ASR	but i did indeed have a strawberry
71-1_769.54_2.64.wav_ASR	so something happens soon
71-1_772.78_3.16.wav_ASR	um and in the household i got to watch the interior
71-1_776.46_0.954.wav_ASR	and it's
71-1_780.18_0.96.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
71-1_781.58_4.48.wav_ASR	yeah so yeah so two years two years later here
71-1_797.2_17.56.wav_ASR	well again and if i ever get to the point that i'm articulately of about this i'm going to use my little science um accuracy and and research and do something more about getting people some kind of training
71-1_814.772_2.553.wav_ASR	um i was given an almost nothing
71-1_817.552_3.086.wav_ASR	partly i think it was because uh
71-1_820.772_2.485.wav_ASR	yeah it's really matthew spongy as well as a major city
71-1_823.472_6.42.wav_ASR	so i should have been able to get the best type of um uh help uh
71-1_830.372_0.477.wav_ASR	uh i did
71-1_830.849_4.78.wav_ASR	um the best i could get was we found two speech stereo
71-1_836.569_2.232.wav_ASR	one of them only specified in children
71-1_839.189_1.351.wav_ASR	so i didn't with
71-1_840.909_0.92.wav_ASR	the other person
71-1_842.229_4.18.wav_ASR	it's it's directly one hour a week
71-1_847.59_16.523.wav_ASR	and um basically because i am an academic because i have the ability to read components and because that part of my brain wasn't um um interfared with in any way i had my own research
71-1_864.29_2.08.wav_ASR	had to do a lot of research
71-1_866.55_4.28.wav_ASR	and uh the the speech recogniser
71-1_871.09_0.612.wav_ASR	it's different
71-1_872.39_3.118.wav_ASR	shes i mean she helped me a lot i would say
71-1_875.61_2.902.wav_ASR	so i should be looking up on this particular thing
71-1_878.63_2.25.wav_ASR	and i should be looking
71-1_881.53_3.02.wav_ASR	but she hadn't kept up with it either
71-1_884.71_4.16.wav_ASR	she hadn't learned about some of the most recent trends that were available
71-1_889.53_7.52.wav_ASR	so basically what i did is um i'm i went back to the essence as soon as they allowed me
71-1_897.35_2.7.wav_ASR	we couldn't work out for three month
71-1_900.34_5.67.wav_ASR	we could only walk back because they were concerned that my physical ability had something to do with the
71-1_906.42_0.66.wav_ASR	sh
71-1_909.64_1.189.wav_ASR	oh i just had to walk
71-1_911.14_1.081.wav_ASR	um i had to
71-1_913.2_1.401.wav_ASR	tested me for a. v.
71-1_914.74_3.28.wav_ASR	and i had to wire this remote on for about three months
71-1_918.17_2.86.wav_ASR	but i don't have a fib either so
71-1_921.33_2.315.wav_ASR	um but i focus on dice
71-1_924.37_4.82.wav_ASR	um um i really wasn't drinking much alcohol at all then anyway
71-1_930.27_1.38.wav_ASR	uh i'd stop it completely
71-1_932.87_2.66.wav_ASR	um so now i'm back exchanging it's much as i can
71-1_935.83_2.18.wav_ASR	um uh really careful in terms of my dice
71-1_938.49_7.52.wav_ASR	um and i really uh focus on implementation uh limiting it in terms of my diet and what i
71-1_947.57_2.29.wav_ASR	and i write every day
71-1_950.51_1.38.wav_ASR	um i generate every day
71-1_951.89_3.934.wav_ASR	alright now i'm trying to write an article um which i hope to get published
71-1_955.824_20.3.wav_ASR	because that's maybe the hardest thing from my brain but i've ever had to do before the scroll or after is the uh ability to weave arguments together in um it really um ends um well written type of of argument
71-1_976.405_1.819.wav_ASR	um so top drawer
71-1_978.345_9.56.wav_ASR	um i read aloud every day uh the news papers because i think s words is a way of reading those
71-1_988.605_2.865.wav_ASR	uh whether it's the files that were
71-1_991.665_2.454.wav_ASR	you just need to learn how to say a word
71-1_994.405_0.82.wav_ASR	lighting
71-1_995.479_4.388.wav_ASR	and i'll probably be able to say that a lot for a long time until the weeks
71-1_999.919_4.279.wav_ASR	then i'll miss miss uh pronounce that one again
71-1_1005.119_5.531.wav_ASR	um that's really all i know how to do is keeping it up in terms of
71-1_1011.439_0.611.wav_ASR	and sleeping
71-1_1012.379_2.191.wav_ASR	um
71-1_1014.87_2.86.wav_ASR	generally i have gone without it
71-1_1018.68_1.81.wav_ASR	um you know if you stay late you're doing some
71-1_1020.89_3.12.wav_ASR	you still have to get up because you have a class or you've got stuff to do
71-1_1024.67_8.638.wav_ASR	are you trying to make sure i always have at least eight or nine hours a week um uh hours a day to be able to sleep
71-1_1033.308_3.68.wav_ASR	and that seems to be something that i didn't need to do before
71-1_1037.181_1.688.wav_ASR	now i really do need to do
71-1_1038.968_2.762.wav_ASR	but that's all i do
71-1_1042.028_0.872.wav_ASR	um still working
71-1_1043.248_1.404.wav_ASR	but i'm not able to pitch
71-1_1045.089_3.024.wav_ASR	oh you can see what i would be like in ninety minute
71-1_1048.268_0.89.wav_ASR	got front and back of the
71-1_1049.328_0.769.wav_ASR	it's hard to talk
71-1_1050.288_0.602.wav_ASR	could be good
71-1_1051.388_0.52.wav_ASR	so
71-1_1052.271_0.5.wav_ASR	yeah
71-1_1054.451_1.998.wav_ASR	so maybe that'll come
71-1_1056.791_0.58.wav_ASR	we can do
71-1_1058.051_3.74.wav_ASR	we could teach through on line stuff
71-1_1062.471_2.149.wav_ASR	it's um so far i'm just doing other stuff
71-1_1064.971_1.119.wav_ASR	um i did a lot of research
71-1_1067.49_1.36.wav_ASR	we'll see if i can get back to it again
71-1_1069.371_0.419.wav_ASR	you don't know
71-1_1070.87_1.35.wav_ASR	 anyways so that's what i do
71-1_1072.81_4.64.wav_ASR	um and and i think doing it consistently is really important
71-1_1077.79_2.66.wav_ASR	and i just keep pushing myself to do different things
71-1_1081.13_6.08.wav_ASR	um uh there's little bit of nothing that i'm not focusing myself to
71-1_1087.51_0.909.wav_ASR	now focusing my so
71-1_1088.69_2.265.wav_ASR	it's certain things i go through every single day
71-1_1091.81_2.36.wav_ASR	um i do yoga every night
71-1_1094.51_1.1.wav_ASR	i think that's useful
71-1_1096.57_1.69.wav_ASR	uh i don't know
71-1_1098.26_19.94.wav_ASR	um again i'm always looking at my research i'll be able to increase uh my reading in some way or another um to the extent that my brain will be able to repair those um language parts
71-1_1119.04_7.42.wav_ASR	i spent a fair amount of time trying to figure out why a right handed person with the scroll on the right side ended up with a phase
71-1_1127.38_10.66.wav_ASR	but i mean other than the fact that it doesn't qualify me for many logical trials because
71-1_1138.248_3.801.wav_ASR	um other than that i guess i just don't worry about it all that much
71-1_1142.228_13.0.wav_ASR	and just doing what i can to try to heal and recover on normal plastic to be able to take force uh take take hold
71-1_1155.48_9.755.wav_ASR	though um i do understand that my age in my sixties is less likely as much as children is
71-1_1165.72_1.66.wav_ASR	so
71-1_1167.66_0.67.wav_ASR	we'll see what
71-1_1168.91_6.48.wav_ASR	just watch it every day um this experiment in work or this work in progress and see
71-1_1175.93_2.077.wav_ASR	how it comes out and how it doesn't come out
71-1_1178.67_1.08.wav_ASR	we'll see yeah
71-1_1179.91_1.98.wav_ASR	all the people don't know i have a face
71-1_1182.17_12.68.wav_ASR	and i like keeping it that way because the uh there is a s a s a magnesium attached to having a disposable
71-1_1196.42_8.392.wav_ASR	but rather just think i miss pop um then then think that they have to speak very carefully around me
71-1_1205.08_4.784.wav_ASR	oh i i'd rather just see if i can just win it
71-1_1210.7_3.66.wav_ASR	oh yeah very few people know that i have that i have a phase
71-1_1214.592_1.416.wav_ASR	the samples no
71-1_1216.008_3.437.wav_ASR	but um i don't tell anyone else about
71-1_1219.768_1.825.wav_ASR	it's just tried to figure it out
71-1_1242.33_1.36.wav_ASR	and it should be something important
71-1_1246.83_4.6.wav_ASR	you know i i guess i would
71-1_1251.764_12.94.wav_ASR	something that i would say is being very important for me
71-1_1266.024_2.112.wav_ASR	um very close to our target
71-1_1268.136_3.957.wav_ASR	uh i met a. d. a. d. about ten years ago
71-1_1273.036_2.404.wav_ASR	oh probably more fifteen years at this point
71-1_1276.336_2.78.wav_ASR	and i was teaching um at a university
71-1_1279.476_1.38.wav_ASR	and invited her to
71-1_1280.996_6.4.wav_ASR	was the advisor of the native students' organisation because my research has on state triple relationship
71-1_1287.93_7.06.wav_ASR	and i had invented her to come and speak in uh one of my classes
71-1_1295.79_0.926.wav_ASR	and she came down
71-1_1297.17_2.48.wav_ASR	and we hit it off with each other
71-1_1300.24_3.96.wav_ASR	and she was one of the most remarkable people that i've ever met
71-1_1304.73_5.19.wav_ASR	um she was the oldest in a family of a lemon
71-1_1310.55_3.42.wav_ASR	she grew up on the manhattan's revolution without running water
71-1_1315.01_5.11.wav_ASR	he was the first person to um get a colourful degree from her pride
71-1_1321.04_3.68.wav_ASR	and she became the first female triple chair
71-1_1325.92_7.08.wav_ASR	and in the last ten years i would say uh we've gone on and trips together
71-1_1333.92_3.12.wav_ASR	and i generally because as she's getting older she's under eighty
71-1_1337.32_0.87.wav_ASR	so she lets me
71-1_1339.05_7.74.wav_ASR	and go to different ends um or different um headings in which um she's going to offer test
71-1_1347.67_7.05.wav_ASR	what i've learned from hanging out with this one who's uh innovative was the word i would use
71-1_1355.21_1.06.wav_ASR	yeah
71-1_1356.984_2.503.wav_ASR	she doesn't see that well any more
71-1_1359.704_1.4.wav_ASR	you have trouble reading anymore
71-1_1361.57_3.02.wav_ASR	but um she has me right speeches for
71-1_1365.124_1.586.wav_ASR	he gets up and presents
71-1_1366.71_12.02.wav_ASR	um and she produces to to take uh she receives it to the the response no
71-1_1379.45_3.74.wav_ASR	she will find a way to power on through
71-1_1384.07_3.535.wav_ASR	and she gets things done that other people have not done
71-1_1387.89_9.96.wav_ASR	and why i see this is important is my own brother is very passionate and very kind of me and benefits that you derive to men
71-1_1398.43_12.315.wav_ASR	and hanging out with a. d. a. i have learned a great deal about what it means to be a powerful one not to worry about a few peopled when you say something
71-1_1411.09_1.635.wav_ASR	and just get up
71-1_1412.95_0.663.wav_ASR	see your tr
71-1_1414.29_1.84.wav_ASR	and present your test module
71-1_1416.263_8.47.wav_ASR	and push everywhere that you can easily to be able to get things through that you wanna get through
71-1_1424.733_14.14.wav_ASR	so working with a. d. uh over the last couple of years we've been able to stop a mind from the minds of the mania group which would have been really just
71-1_1440.7_6.776.wav_ASR	so um she has been my uh inspiration in terms of what i've learned from her
71-1_1447.78_1.68.wav_ASR	yeah
71-1_1449.92_2.26.wav_ASR	uh so that's that's the other
71-1_1452.86_0.96.wav_ASR	and so yeah
71-1_1454.02_6.652.wav_ASR	he's been an on going um source of importance for me i think to model myself after
71-1_1514.123_7.78.wav_ASR	well i mean it looks like begins with um a boy who's playing with uh soccer
71-1_1522.3_7.984.wav_ASR	because on his own uh probably in his garden um because this is something that he's really interested in doing
71-1_1530.81_8.77.wav_ASR	and he kick the ball maybe a little bit too powerful loudly and he wants
71-1_1540.7_3.8.wav_ASR	and it broke into the window next door
71-1_1545.58_2.64.wav_ASR	and unfortunately um
71-1_1549.0_11.31.wav_ASR	the the ball came through the window um right next to the cherry where his next door is sitting on his chair
71-1_1561.7_4.32.wav_ASR	so he's obviously really upset about this because he could have been hurt
71-1_1566.34_1.16.wav_ASR	and the glasses are bright
71-1_1568.22_1.04.wav_ASR	and it's in his
71-1_1569.74_1.088.wav_ASR	it shouldn't happen
71-1_1571.64_7.02.wav_ASR	and so he grabs the chair looks out the window to find the cobra who did this to him
71-1_1578.75_3.64.wav_ASR	they're going to be some kind of um uh
71-1_1582.51_3.18.wav_ASR	it's gonna need some kind of repetitions that are made
71-1_1585.938_20.64.wav_ASR	uh he looks like he's about ready to head over grab the boy and had to go through how the window would be paid for how he would get his own thing again would stay away from the window
71-1_1623.92_0.5.wav_ASR	oh
71-1_1624.855_4.46.wav_ASR	well it looks as if this little
71-1_1630.595_1.88.wav_ASR	it's
71-1_1632.686_1.727.wav_ASR	hard disk actually it could be kind of
71-1_1635.675_3.5.wav_ASR	can't decide if it's male or female
71-1_1639.515_3.031.wav_ASR	smile
71-1_1643.288_9.44.wav_ASR	um they's getting ready to head out to the library somewhere
71-1_1653.76_5.85.wav_ASR	and their mother looked outside and
71-1_1660.248_1.642.wav_ASR	now i think we're gonna see some rain
71-1_1662.48_1.17.wav_ASR	you might need the alarm
71-1_1664.82_1.11.wav_ASR	but this child said
71-1_1666.34_1.55.wav_ASR	you don't need an opener
71-1_1668.44_1.2.wav_ASR	you mean this is regular
71-1_1669.94_0.6.wav_ASR	it's not a rabbit
71-1_1670.78_1.68.wav_ASR	and i don't really care about getting
71-1_1672.82_0.87.wav_ASR	you know i don't
71-1_1674.76_0.73.wav_ASR	and not like sure
71-1_1675.74_1.68.wav_ASR	you don't melt when the water hits
71-1_1678.28_1.97.wav_ASR	oh this this children
71-1_1680.78_0.88.wav_ASR	and we're leaving anyway
71-1_1681.66_1.72.wav_ASR	it's a shark
71-1_1683.529_1.775.wav_ASR	it immediately becomes a problem
71-1_1686.38_1.31.wav_ASR	all the buttons
71-1_1688.02_4.78.wav_ASR	yeah i'm getting i'm getting rings in my eyes
71-1_1693.33_1.4.wav_ASR	um i'm really bad
71-1_1695.36_1.22.wav_ASR	this is not
71-1_1697.22_2.14.wav_ASR	you didn't stand that it would get in my eyes
71-1_1700.24_4.96.wav_ASR	so i immediately headed back because it was ranging much harder than i thought it was
71-1_1706.08_0.654.wav_ASR	long hand
71-1_1706.84_0.896.wav_ASR	it's a matter
71-1_1708.14_1.485.wav_ASR	um i just looked at her
71-1_1710.54_2.22.wav_ASR	she of course knew that i was right
71-1_1713.18_11.1.wav_ASR	um the mother immediately understood that while it was very difficult for this child to ask for it or to acknowledge that they were wrong
71-1_1725.08_5.08.wav_ASR	um they did make clear that they didn't need an umbrella if they were gonna be walking to the light
71-1_1730.64_3.56.wav_ASR	so the mother then gave them the
71-1_1734.68_10.14.wav_ASR	and they went back on their way with an algorithm remembering at this point that maybe others actually know what they're talking about
71-1_1761.65_0.5.wav_ASR	yeah
71-1_1762.547_29.94.wav_ASR	well what happened um is that the cat um the cat that belongs to the little girl and it became in a t. and a and became too clear that it didn't want to get off the tree but no longer that
71-1_1800.778_0.579.wav_ASR	it's all me
71-1_1802.158_0.382.wav_ASR	me
71-1_1802.54_6.1.wav_ASR	and the little girl is obviously just really annoying about the situation of our
71-1_1808.838_1.772.wav_ASR	she's very worried about getting her cat
71-1_1811.358_5.082.wav_ASR	so she began by going to her father and
71-1_1816.78_4.1.wav_ASR	can you please help me get the cat out of the tree
71-1_1820.94_4.437.wav_ASR	and the and the
71-1_1825.6_0.417.wav_ASR	four
71-1_1826.1_18.22.wav_ASR	and he grabbed his laptop and put it against the the the lime where the the clock was because uh those branches are too fragile
71-1_1845.67_8.6.wav_ASR	um he also inventively kick off the la later which then puts him back in the situation that he needs to be rescued
71-1_1855.03_5.868.wav_ASR	so at this point the dog is now barking because the dog wants to get out of the tree
71-1_1861.6_10.368.wav_ASR	the backing of the door of the dog is making it more difficult for the cat to be able to inch its way back to the trunk
71-1_1872.9_8.052.wav_ASR	oh sorry the little girl is still really stressing because her child um her child's got
71-1_1880.952_2.68.wav_ASR	that's a that's a sentimental pear
71-1_1883.772_0.899.wav_ASR	make that
71-1_1885.192_3.057.wav_ASR	is really wants her cat to be able to get out
71-1_1888.249_17.88.wav_ASR	so they call the finder the department to come down and not just rescue the cat but also rescued since he's accustomed to putting the ladder against the tree
71-1_1906.179_13.419.wav_ASR	uh but it it does actually shows that the faster um was really trying to do whatever his daughter wanted him to do in terms of helping on the uh get the cat out of the tree
71-1_1939.75_0.39.wav_ASR	yeah
71-1_2104.158_2.744.wav_ASR	um i'll keep the femminist criteria a bit
71-1_2107.478_3.16.wav_ASR	it'll be next time around
71-1_2113.118_0.492.wav_ASR	it
71-1_2113.85_8.89.wav_ASR	um cinderella is um she's the director of a
71-1_2123.66_2.76.wav_ASR	um her mother has killed has been killed
71-1_2127.23_2.66.wav_ASR	and so the two of them are
71-1_2131.04_13.9.wav_ASR	being and the her father decided that it would be really helpful for his daughter if he remembered if he could provide a better for his daughter
71-1_2146.02_1.74.wav_ASR	so he met this
71-1_2149.12_2.03.wav_ASR	uh don't know that we've ever heard a name
71-1_2151.74_3.0.wav_ASR	um but anyway th otherwise known as
71-1_2155.58_6.48.wav_ASR	made very clear that he would be that she would be a wonderful mother to her children
71-1_2162.44_1.851.wav_ASR	she also had two dollars of her own
71-1_2165.48_1.34.wav_ASR	or
71-1_2167.42_10.34.wav_ASR	and and fortunately the way that s um cinderella was stated was not appropriate
71-1_2178.36_5.417.wav_ASR	he was not uh treated the same way that the steph's daughters were treated
71-1_2183.777_4.48.wav_ASR	and and instead she was used as a as a as a mate
71-1_2188.336_5.469.wav_ASR	and i have no idea where her father is in this whole picture and why he's not doing anything about this
71-1_2194.037_3.593.wav_ASR	but uh maybe he's stumbling or he's gone or whatever
71-1_2197.83_17.72.wav_ASR	but he's left the management of his daughter to the stepmother who um treats her very badly um doesn't treat her the same and has given the message to her daughter
71-1_2216.67_10.5.wav_ASR	so she often becomes the maid to these two stepsisters and to a step mom
71-1_2228.39_5.92.wav_ASR	um but she still has she's a very very sweet young one
71-1_2235.23_16.92.wav_ASR	she has found uh she's found a way to also have hampishness and elaborate relationships with um the animals because that's one of her jobs is to um makes sure that the animals are fed
71-1_2252.39_1.84.wav_ASR	so she sings t
71-1_2255.14_0.93.wav_ASR	oh
71-1_2256.32_5.39.wav_ASR	she's close to the the the horns um the other animals um the other animals
71-1_2262.1_9.26.wav_ASR	and she dreams about uh being in a better situation where she's lucked and is treated um with more respect than she is
71-1_2271.67_11.59.wav_ASR	oh she's so quite beautiful which is certainly one of the reasons why the stepsisters are so um mean to her because they are not anyway near as attractive as she
71-1_2284.39_18.53.wav_ASR	but um while this is going on in this household the king would like to his mind to his son that it's time for him to marry because the king would like to retire
71-1_2303.08_7.52.wav_ASR	and he'd like to um hand down the uh kindergarten to his son
71-1_2311.32_1.88.wav_ASR	but first his son has to marry
71-1_2313.84_2.509.wav_ASR	and um he doesn't really want to
71-1_2316.62_1.587.wav_ASR	he's not interested in any more
71-1_2318.34_1.38.wav_ASR	it's not dating any more
71-1_2320.22_3.01.wav_ASR	but uh the plan is that this is his duty
71-1_2324.16_3.094.wav_ASR	it's kind of like the print hery of that time
71-1_2327.3_3.0.wav_ASR	the spare
71-1_2331.06_5.74.wav_ASR	but in any case uh the plan is that there's gonna be a a giant ball a large
71-1_2336.832_13.545.wav_ASR	and and all of the elderly which i guess means of child bearing barren years are supposed to show up at this dance so that he can pick the one that he wants
71-1_2350.732_4.303.wav_ASR	and again we will not get into the femminis cute of how this all work
71-1_2356.58_2.034.wav_ASR	indeedly uh the word gets out
71-1_2359.36_6.948.wav_ASR	the two stepsisters are just really excited about this idea because they're the right age
71-1_2366.94_9.235.wav_ASR	um because their mother had married sinclair's brother who makes a fair amount of money um they can stress really well
71-1_2376.175_11.163.wav_ASR	well they can they can get dressed up to go to this and uh see if they could be the one that would attract the um the attention of the print
71-1_2388.615_1.676.wav_ASR	uh it's a giraffe wants to go
71-1_2390.815_3.322.wav_ASR	um she also reads about this that that is coming
71-1_2394.137_3.18.wav_ASR	that she knows she's able because she's the right age
71-1_2397.537_6.18.wav_ASR	um i guess she's of that nationality or whatever criteria they're used
71-1_2404.5_6.33.wav_ASR	uh but her stepmother kind of makes it clear that no she's not invited to go
71-1_2411.78_5.16.wav_ASR	um she's not gonna be able to go to stores and buy clothes the way that
71-1_2417.82_2.25.wav_ASR	um so she tried to make something on our
71-1_2420.4_3.38.wav_ASR	he tried to take the materials and the rugs that are available
71-1_2424.24_4.62.wav_ASR	it looks uh looks up how to make them in a
71-1_2429.36_1.08.wav_ASR	it was on page seven
71-1_2430.56_1.38.wav_ASR	you think that's what
71-1_2432.61_1.33.wav_ASR	and she comes up
71-1_2434.24_1.5.wav_ASR	and of course she looks amazing
71-1_2436.71_9.244.wav_ASR	it's our pretty and pink the fill the smell with um she should've got away with it
71-1_2446.2_1.78.wav_ASR	uh this is not
71-1_2449.65_1.12.wav_ASR	this is
71-1_2450.992_2.458.wav_ASR	so her mother loves at her and
71-1_2453.57_1.49.wav_ASR	you're not going out with those clothes
71-1_2455.45_2.61.wav_ASR	and her step sisters
71-1_2458.95_2.32.wav_ASR	and she's out in the bar by her
71-1_2462.19_9.66.wav_ASR	and the sound this um very good godmother shows up um based on one of her words
71-1_2472.03_2.42.wav_ASR	or wish i could go to the ball
71-1_2475.65_12.128.wav_ASR	and she the reason that the hairy sorry very godmother brother is showing up is because she knows that um sander is a is a really sweet young girl
71-1_2488.53_2.041.wav_ASR	and she cares about everybody else
71-1_2490.87_1.674.wav_ASR	she does things for everybody else
71-1_2492.544_4.96.wav_ASR	and because of the purity of her heart she deserves this chance
71-1_2498.584_2.36.wav_ASR	so she uses her
71-1_2502.18_6.324.wav_ASR	and she not only creates a dress for her that is uh incredibly orange
71-1_2509.124_2.72.wav_ASR	you can go
71-1_2511.9_14.753.wav_ASR	um but she also transforms the mice into horses and the pumpkin in to uh carbohydrate to be able to take her so that she can get there
71-1_2526.84_2.1.wav_ASR	um and she can write in style
71-1_2529.78_4.64.wav_ASR	so uh cinderella it's very very happy hush her
71-1_2534.78_0.88.wav_ASR	or our grandmothers
71-1_2535.86_5.98.wav_ASR	remember this only will last until mid night
71-1_2542.26_4.463.wav_ASR	at mid night your dress will go back to your rug
71-1_2546.723_5.94.wav_ASR	inks your forecasts will go back will be transferred back in to
71-1_2554.163_6.318.wav_ASR	and the code will be or the characters will be transformed back into a pumpkin
71-1_2561.13_0.573.wav_ASR	and she said
71-1_2561.943_0.442.wav_ASR	so i know
71-1_2562.423_0.792.wav_ASR	thank you very much
71-1_2563.463_3.157.wav_ASR	if she goes to the
71-1_2567.38_17.24.wav_ASR	and of course because she is so uh addicted and shows up with this um really uh regular type of carbohydrate she's treated as well
71-1_2584.975_2.916.wav_ASR	should she the but men opens the door
71-1_2588.095_0.812.wav_ASR	help
71-1_2589.635_0.812.wav_ASR	he walks in now
71-1_2590.635_2.32.wav_ASR	indeed the print's just like
71-1_2593.435_0.658.wav_ASR	like that
71-1_2594.515_2.3.wav_ASR	it's like he's been stuck by lightning
71-1_2597.575_1.165.wav_ASR	he's the one i want to be
71-1_2598.975_1.165.wav_ASR	he heads over to her
71-1_2600.475_2.06.wav_ASR	there's an instinct
71-1_2604.46_2.0.wav_ASR	he dances with her the entire night
71-1_2606.82_5.16.wav_ASR	um he's pretty clear that maybe at this point in the world if i get to be with this one
71-1_2613.19_4.0.wav_ASR	and he's and sh and l. c. d. screen is pulling away
71-1_2617.56_0.34.wav_ASR	sh
71-1_2618.12_0.46.wav_ASR	got a good
71-1_2618.76_0.34.wav_ASR	is it
71-1_2619.22_1.32.wav_ASR	oh no it's a giraffe
71-1_2620.94_0.6.wav_ASR	okay
71-1_2622.58_0.6.wav_ASR	it's here
71-1_2624.18_1.12.wav_ASR	oh
71-1_2625.6_0.71.wav_ASR	oh i gotta get that
71-1_2626.5_0.52.wav_ASR	got a go
71-1_2627.3_5.8.wav_ASR	and she runs away uh at about two or three minutes to mid night because her she's
71-1_2633.26_1.166.wav_ASR	oh g i've got this curve
71-1_2634.56_0.786.wav_ASR	and i got a way
71-1_2635.38_1.167.wav_ASR	and she reuses a way
71-1_2637.7_2.81.wav_ASR	it's all the same she's i mean she's a really fast
71-1_2640.94_0.44.wav_ASR	so
71-1_2641.38_4.57.wav_ASR	way but all the same he sees that one of her shoes has been left there
71-1_2646.16_0.98.wav_ASR	the last speaker
71-1_2647.86_2.174.wav_ASR	um and so we picks that up
71-1_2650.2_3.24.wav_ASR	it's all he's got of her is this glass
71-1_2654.1_2.56.wav_ASR	so he goes back to his father and
71-1_2657.28_1.28.wav_ASR	uh i'll marry somebody
71-1_2658.86_1.868.wav_ASR	uh there's only one moment i wanna remember
71-1_2660.728_1.516.wav_ASR	and she's the one i wanna marry
71-1_2662.968_4.68.wav_ASR	and all i have is this clue that her but will fit into this
71-1_2668.928_2.54.wav_ASR	it's sort of advertising around the kindergarten
71-1_2672.608_7.36.wav_ASR	one that can who's feedback will fit into these libraries um the print will see you as a content
71-1_2680.85_7.16.wav_ASR	so oh okay oh the step steps who you know they were ignored at the ball
71-1_2688.27_2.82.wav_ASR	but they're pretty sure they can get their feet into the s clip
71-1_2692.05_1.6.wav_ASR	one of the internet
71-1_2694.54_19.21.wav_ASR	so he's and and of course at this point it's going to work taking care of the animals cleaning in the kitchen um once again just uh disturbing and ignoring
71-1_2714.59_1.81.wav_ASR	so the print starts drawing around
71-1_2716.91_4.25.wav_ASR	well i mean it's this really desirable so sort of thing that he's writing about
71-1_2721.43_10.724.wav_ASR	people are running out taking off their shoes and seeing if their feet will fit into this one single one
71-1_2733.67_1.9.wav_ASR	and he hands up and he stops at their house
71-1_2735.77_6.34.wav_ASR	he's really discouraged this point because he hasn't yet found a one who's feet will fit into that um slide
71-1_2743.01_1.095.wav_ASR	stops at this house
71-1_2744.37_2.793.wav_ASR	all the the stepisters do everything they can
71-1_2747.29_3.08.wav_ASR	but their feet are just too big or too long or
71-1_2750.71_0.798.wav_ASR	it's not work
71-1_2751.632_3.22.wav_ASR	and then all the sudden uh s
71-1_2755.261_2.278.wav_ASR	um he's just about ready to leave
71-1_2757.592_1.74.wav_ASR	he's seen a movie
71-1_2760.172_5.59.wav_ASR	and he sees this other one like the mail who's just in the corner
71-1_2766.572_0.428.wav_ASR	and he's
71-1_2767.252_0.588.wav_ASR	don't hear
71-1_2768.83_1.36.wav_ASR	and the steph
71-1_2770.312_0.798.wav_ASR	oh she's no
71-1_2771.5_0.97.wav_ASR	shoes
71-1_2773.43_1.84.wav_ASR	and she looks up
71-1_2775.92_5.43.wav_ASR	and he the price just has this strange feeling about her and
71-1_2781.92_1.44.wav_ASR	it's like to have her come out
71-1_2783.78_7.311.wav_ASR	and i'd like to s see if her feet will w i if this if the spiders will fit her feet
71-1_2791.091_2.035.wav_ASR	and so she comes at
71-1_2793.371_0.92.wav_ASR	it's a mouse
71-1_2794.711_3.639.wav_ASR	um you know she's been working in the kitchen and in the b
71-1_2798.931_6.2.wav_ASR	and she's you know not not looking anywhere like the process person that had been at the
71-1_2805.87_0.8.wav_ASR	but she came out
71-1_2806.831_0.759.wav_ASR	he's got
71-1_2808.51_3.56.wav_ASR	uh the print put the slider on her foot
71-1_2812.99_1.08.wav_ASR	and it fits
71-1_2814.73_0.98.wav_ASR	and then he looked at
71-1_2815.71_22.48.wav_ASR	and what was remarkable is that he was able to look beyond all of the gadget of the world that she had to see that it was exactly the same purpose even if she was clearly not of the same status that she had to see
71-1_2839.43_15.337.wav_ASR	oh they're happily uh they'd love happily after until just like print harry so they're not um high enough standard
71-1_2854.767_18.19.wav_ASR	and they had to he had to remove his cradle and go to another continent and yeah and then start writing uh producing mete filled bits nets nets
71-1_2872.957_0.84.wav_ASR	alright
71-1_2874.864_1.272.wav_ASR	oh yeah
71-1_2900.37_0.5.wav_ASR	okay
71-1_2905.61_1.0.wav_ASR	oh
71-1_2910.67_11.58.wav_ASR	um an interesting really irritating thing about clocks to me recently is that i went to a physical check
71-1_2923.03_2.831.wav_ASR	and i just turned sixty five
71-1_2926.39_2.52.wav_ASR	so i had never experienced this before
71-1_2929.05_5.28.wav_ASR	and i thought it was my uni my anal um physical
71-1_2935.52_1.03.wav_ASR	oh right
71-1_2936.75_0.57.wav_ASR	they said it
71-1_2937.65_2.34.wav_ASR	the nose is checking my blood pressure
71-1_2940.41_4.62.wav_ASR	if you're checking you know the my heart rate my pulse and all the other stuff
71-1_2945.73_3.06.wav_ASR	and then she handed me a piece of paper and a pen and said
71-1_2948.98_1.34.wav_ASR	i'd like you to draw a col
71-1_2951.06_1.01.wav_ASR	yeah
71-1_2953.58_0.57.wav_ASR	and she said
71-1_2954.34_3.38.wav_ASR	because i i want to see what kind of picture you you can draw
71-1_2958.32_2.76.wav_ASR	so it seemed ridiculous
71-1_2961.62_1.027.wav_ASR	uh i did it anyway
71-1_2963.0_0.93.wav_ASR	oh
71-1_2964.52_9.32.wav_ASR	and i knew how to how to draw a picture appropriately with a clock which is you first you put down the twelve
71-1_2974.0_0.89.wav_ASR	and then
71-1_2975.14_0.66.wav_ASR	and
71-1_2975.98_0.71.wav_ASR	then you put the n
71-1_2976.74_8.82.wav_ASR	and then you fill the numbers so that everything is located um where it should be instead of you know having them too crowded
71-1_2986.12_3.09.wav_ASR	and then i had to draw the pictures of two forty five
71-1_2990.32_1.08.wav_ASR	um and i finished
71-1_2991.6_0.4.wav_ASR	think so
71-1_2992.42_1.46.wav_ASR	or is this what you want
71-1_2994.75_4.17.wav_ASR	or did you want to just look at what you have on the wall that's right there which is a
71-1_2999.82_0.95.wav_ASR	and she said
71-1_3001.11_2.02.wav_ASR	um you have passed this
71-1_3003.49_0.32.wav_ASR	okay
71-1_3004.28_1.87.wav_ASR	it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's
71-1_3006.254_13.939.wav_ASR	but then you are sixty five and you go in for a a s sorry when you go to see a a an opportunity uh for an anonymous check you will have to draw a clock
71-1_3020.834_0.477.wav_ASR	and
71-1_3021.514_2.193.wav_ASR	one point will they stop doing this
71-1_3023.76_9.43.wav_ASR	because um well i did indeed go up with the you know the round soft
71-1_3033.8_1.68.wav_ASR	everything i do is
71-1_3035.807_16.95.wav_ASR	what happens at what generation will they decide that this is not the way to show that you do not have dimension or big end or whatever and that you simply have um a digital understanding of of what time is
71-1_3053.5_2.36.wav_ASR	so anyway if i do it i'm not gonna do it again
71-1_3056.16_6.11.wav_ASR	just gonna d maybe i'll just message with them and just put down some digital stuff and
71-1_3062.88_3.78.wav_ASR	yeah i have my p. k. a. or something like push button
71-1_3066.9_2.818.wav_ASR	but anyway it's it's a it's a test that they do
71-1_3069.718_3.888.wav_ASR	and i found it really irritating though i pass
71-1_3074.018_3.915.wav_ASR	and it's it's it's gonna be ugly very very quickly
71-1_3078.438_1.048.wav_ASR	yeah
71-1_3084.638_1.963.wav_ASR	let me see
71-1_3091.487_18.88.wav_ASR	one of the things i used to do when my daughter was younger i usually the first week and the second year um we would had to get together to watch the email watch
71-1_3110.83_14.71.wav_ASR	and what the egocentre works is is moreover here on the spongy rivers are on the way um somewhere else
71-1_3125.67_0.72.wav_ASR	they're coming back
71-1_3126.63_1.247.wav_ASR	going south or something
71-1_3127.877_5.666.wav_ASR	but they all show up in this uh for about three or four days
71-1_3134.157_8.44.wav_ASR	and so what people do is they have groups um the audios and other groups that show up with um
71-1_3144.23_4.65.wav_ASR	and we watch uh the the birds the eggs because you can see it
71-1_3149.19_1.113.wav_ASR	you're really really close
71-1_3150.45_1.46.wav_ASR	you can see the
71-1_3152.49_1.454.wav_ASR	and you can see them with their mouth
71-1_3154.33_2.28.wav_ASR	and there's just so many of them at one time
71-1_3157.17_2.038.wav_ASR	um it's a spongy we have a lot of hard
71-1_3159.43_4.8.wav_ASR	but we don't necessarily see bold the eggs as much
71-1_3164.36_1.23.wav_ASR	it's much more rare
71-1_3166.48_4.788.wav_ASR	um that's something that we did for a number of years
71-1_3171.36_2.94.wav_ASR	even when she was thirteen and wasn't really talking
71-1_3174.98_2.763.wav_ASR	um we always had fun on that day
71-1_3177.96_0.725.wav_ASR	we should
71-1_3179.02_3.122.wav_ASR	for first you dress really well because it's gonna be twenty below
71-1_3182.59_3.58.wav_ASR	um we would go to the banks with banana
71-1_3186.63_2.08.wav_ASR	we would wait for the eggs to grow
71-1_3188.91_1.44.wav_ASR	we would watch them for life
71-1_3190.65_2.38.wav_ASR	then we would go have
71-1_3193.31_2.86.wav_ASR	and she will talk that time
71-1_3196.61_2.19.wav_ASR	when we were home then it was
71-1_3199.11_0.88.wav_ASR	good choice is my
71-1_3200.21_0.568.wav_ASR	now hang on
71-1_3200.778_1.896.wav_ASR	oh i don't want to talk about my friends
71-1_3202.738_13.726.wav_ASR	but there was always that one um periodic even though very very difficult early years that my d always talked to me after we watched the eggs
71-1_3216.464_5.16.wav_ASR	so that's one of the uh things that i would think of when i think of the word
71-1_3227.38_1.01.wav_ASR	wha what was the word again
71-1_3230.244_2.56.wav_ASR	oh i don't know if you want to hear that story
71-1_3233.039_0.485.wav_ASR	oh
71-1_3233.991_2.78.wav_ASR	well i okay
71-1_3236.777_13.094.wav_ASR	you can tell you a a recent one um that will clearly not be um rated r. or anything
71-1_3250.021_10.775.wav_ASR	um i will s talk about something i did last summer um just my stroke i'd been trying to push myself a little bit
71-1_3260.881_2.569.wav_ASR	again i'm i'm much more tired than i used to be
71-1_3263.61_5.251.wav_ASR	but um i'm still trying to push my boundaries to find out exactly what's possible
71-1_3268.93_1.28.wav_ASR	and how much can i do
71-1_3270.29_1.827.wav_ASR	and how long can i draw
71-1_3272.13_3.6.wav_ASR	it's and how many hours a day can i you know be active
71-1_3275.741_2.789.wav_ASR	and um so i worked with this non profit
71-1_3279.53_5.7.wav_ASR	and we were having a end in northern wass and o. n. m. g. versus off the um norman renaissance
71-1_3285.397_2.48.wav_ASR	and it's a our our group is called
71-1_3289.337_1.68.wav_ASR	we do with m. m. i.
71-1_3291.677_3.779.wav_ASR	so i head up for this wellness um
71-1_3295.737_1.06.wav_ASR	um i had to get up
71-1_3296.957_5.26.wav_ASR	think i left town at five to get up there by eight
71-1_3302.331_5.519.wav_ASR	we had ads all day long and talking and you know different things going on
71-1_3307.891_1.32.wav_ASR	it was really really hard
71-1_3310.051_3.538.wav_ASR	and i was ready to drive home by five o' clock
71-1_3314.151_2.269.wav_ASR	the about an hour on the
71-1_3317.011_2.559.wav_ASR	about three and a half hour uh three and a half our target
71-1_3319.71_2.98.wav_ASR	you decided i can't drive any more t
71-1_3323.47_1.68.wav_ASR	my head was just
71-1_3326.15_3.68.wav_ASR	um i just i needed to sleep really quickly
71-1_3329.87_2.42.wav_ASR	had to listen to myself
71-1_3332.61_4.86.wav_ASR	my body says you're tired um you pull over and you r
71-1_3337.649_5.112.wav_ASR	you don't just like round through and you know keep on going
71-1_3343.27_1.34.wav_ASR	so i pulled into this hotel
71-1_3345.85_1.66.wav_ASR	um it's a lot i have to know
71-1_3347.849_3.041.wav_ASR	you know i didn't have a resource s research or any
71-1_3351.11_9.614.wav_ASR	and i was just looking for a place that had an opening so i could go in and get out of the sun and uh you know cover my eyes and not have to drive any more
71-1_3360.85_10.96.wav_ASR	but because i was as tired as i was and because i was pushed to my boundaries um uh my age had clearly led
71-1_3372.95_2.18.wav_ASR	so i walked in this whole
71-1_3375.69_3.36.wav_ASR	and um there were lots of i mean clearly there were a lot of bananas
71-1_3379.64_2.57.wav_ASR	um well actually i didn't know that
71-1_3382.66_1.98.wav_ASR	um but i thought it said
71-1_3385.14_0.809.wav_ASR	but i wasn't sure
71-1_3386.18_0.937.wav_ASR	and i went in the door
71-1_3388.0_2.42.wav_ASR	and there's this one behind the the desk
71-1_3390.82_0.48.wav_ASR	and i s
71-1_3391.54_2.24.wav_ASR	now d um i'm here for a room
71-1_3394.62_0.32.wav_ASR	my
71-1_3395.02_1.08.wav_ASR	do you have any extras
71-1_3397.62_5.68.wav_ASR	and and of course that's what happens with the phase
71-1_3403.92_3.86.wav_ASR	you know the vices could have made uh a response to cobra
71-1_3408.16_3.161.wav_ASR	um people are wearing masks
71-1_3411.64_1.783.wav_ASR	and they're being very careful about that
71-1_3413.72_2.58.wav_ASR	but of so of course i was trying to s
71-1_3416.34_1.56.wav_ASR	do you do you have a
71-1_3418.62_1.778.wav_ASR	oh
71-1_3420.7_1.02.wav_ASR	you have a accent
71-1_3422.16_3.26.wav_ASR	and right to her core
71-1_3426.26_1.62.wav_ASR	yeah everybody here's been maxing
71-1_3428.38_0.711.wav_ASR	you all our mate
71-1_3429.38_0.988.wav_ASR	why every thing down
71-1_3430.72_0.54.wav_ASR	um just saying
71-1_3431.88_0.98.wav_ASR	so you have a room
71-1_3433.14_0.664.wav_ASR	and she said
71-1_3433.92_1.033.wav_ASR	yes yes yes yes
71-1_3435.16_0.545.wav_ASR	don't worry
71-1_3435.705_1.0.wav_ASR	we followed c
71-1_3436.845_0.623.wav_ASR	it don't matter
71-1_3437.565_1.797.wav_ASR	or you're not gonna get it here
71-1_3439.805_1.863.wav_ASR	the um she gave me a remote
71-1_3441.825_6.66.wav_ASR	although that was one way to cover things up is you just go with it you know
71-1_3448.76_1.911.wav_ASR	we want it if she had a vagina
71-1_3451.44_0.31.wav_ASR	it's
71-1_3452.165_0.98.wav_ASR	you have a bad
71-1_3453.98_1.77.wav_ASR	and so we just want with boxes
71-1_3456.24_2.03.wav_ASR	and then find my way back to
71-1_3459.14_2.56.wav_ASR	you have an empty room that i can sleep in
71-1_3462.68_5.02.wav_ASR	so i got the room went in dark a lot of cold water and a little bit steeped for twelve hours
71-1_3468.94_0.48.wav_ASR	yeah
71-1_3471.54_2.08.wav_ASR	so that's that's another
71-1_3478.5_0.5.wav_ASR	yeah
71-1_3480.14_0.8.wav_ASR	um
71-1_3481.62_20.94.wav_ASR	um i was going to choose something to talk about um my undergrad um i would talk about how i paid my way through um my undergraduate um which is true
71-1_3504.63_14.68.wav_ASR	but i waited uh beginning at um at kind of a little cobby shop that was um near where i lived because i had no card
71-1_3520.12_1.31.wav_ASR	um and i could just bite there
71-1_3522.42_1.45.wav_ASR	and they were very very kind
71-1_3524.03_2.94.wav_ASR	and i did the research
71-1_3528.1_14.32.wav_ASR	but i learned very quickly after about six months that you would get paid ten to fifteen percent um as a tip based upon the the prices of the restaurant
71-1_3543.14_8.24.wav_ASR	what made sense was the most expensive in terms of prices and were there
71-1_3552.167_3.873.wav_ASR	doing the exact same s same part of survey
71-1_3556.39_19.218.wav_ASR	if they're only paying five dollars for their meal and they're handing you forty cents that's not gonna be nearly as good as it is if they're too four dollars for it
71-1_3575.98_5.36.wav_ASR	so what i learned to do is keep going to more and more and more expensive rest
71-1_3582.46_20.82.wav_ASR	um i mean the the the the maybe untold stories that work in the the like the g. b. smiths that are just as good if not better than the the really um highly priced
71-1_3604.84_2.74.wav_ASR	so um that's what i ended up doing
71-1_3608.2_4.664.wav_ASR	and uh but again it what was so interesting to me is that i worked just as hard
71-1_3613.32_4.157.wav_ASR	and i used the same sort of um you know
71-1_3618.84_5.61.wav_ASR	you have to sort of keep a revolving list of tasks that you're in the middle of doing
71-1_3624.45_1.994.wav_ASR	whether you're going to the bar to get a drink
71-1_3626.65_1.508.wav_ASR	you're going here to get your foot
71-1_3628.39_1.405.wav_ASR	you're gonna go people more or more
71-1_3630.11_0.946.wav_ASR	you're gonna give me your chip
71-1_3631.51_5.578.wav_ASR	you have to keep them all kind of reviewing all at one time
71-1_3637.31_4.757.wav_ASR	trying to decide exactly how you're going to prioritize it each of those tasks
71-1_3642.067_10.0.wav_ASR	it's um it's really i mean being wedginging being a wedge is a really um meaningful um
71-1_3653.687_3.66.wav_ASR	uh it's just borrowed that they don't pay people any money to do that
71-1_3657.49_4.33.wav_ASR	it was luckily because i made enough money that i was still able to grade
71-1_3662.01_8.22.wav_ASR	and i wasn't paying the degree of the amount of money that grand students and undergrads are paying now which is out
71-1_3672.05_0.61.wav_ASR	but
71-1_3673.93_2.38.wav_ASR	so
71-1_3676.61_1.701.wav_ASR	background scroll that was very different
71-1_3678.311_5.3.wav_ASR	but yeah i had no signal lines because i worked as a wireless in research
71-1_3698.06_0.59.wav_ASR	yeah
71-1_3699.03_2.999.wav_ASR	and it's it's really fundamentally kind of like
71-1_3703.14_1.235.wav_ASR	got you know three minutes
71-1_3704.68_0.709.wav_ASR	you can go back
71-1_3705.62_0.591.wav_ASR	okay
71-1_3706.54_0.366.wav_ASR	yeah
71-1_3707.62_2.536.wav_ASR	just sort of like it's it's kind of a challenge
71-1_3710.2_0.816.wav_ASR	it's kind of fun
71-1_3713.34_0.455.wav_ASR	yeah
71-1_3718.76_0.845.wav_ASR	uh we can
71-1_3719.76_0.59.wav_ASR	they need
71-1_3720.7_1.28.wav_ASR	you need more coffee over
71-1_3722.26_0.96.wav_ASR	you got this going on
71-1_3723.52_4.32.wav_ASR	and i will say that um the second place i worked i carried it
71-1_3728.62_8.414.wav_ASR	and i want to get a physical they were trying to figure out why this mouse on this arm was stronger than this one
71-1_3738.16_0.74.wav_ASR	it's something going on
71-1_3739.09_0.75.wav_ASR	your remote
71-1_3739.97_0.49.wav_ASR	and i
71-1_3740.68_1.82.wav_ASR	oh yeah it's really strong
71-1_3743.1_1.92.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
71-1_3753.971_14.825.wav_ASR	um well if i was going to make um pinnotter and gilly sargent i'd begin by telling about the red
71-1_3769.311_2.802.wav_ASR	and taking out two slides of a grid
71-1_3772.113_2.019.wav_ASR	and and learning them on the table
71-1_3774.633_8.24.wav_ASR	then i would go and get the jar of gel and the jar of pineapple
71-1_3783.713_4.173.wav_ASR	and i would bring probably a sponge and a night with me
71-1_3788.57_2.863.wav_ASR	we would begin with the inner button
71-1_3792.068_2.272.wav_ASR	it's really difficult to decide is it
71-1_3794.488_0.84.wav_ASR	pineapple
71-1_3796.268_4.045.wav_ASR	and i would spend that on the on one side of the bread
71-1_3800.828_3.96.wav_ASR	the other piece of bread i would put on
71-1_3805.108_1.06.wav_ASR	would you use a sponge
71-1_3806.568_1.011.wav_ASR	and i would pull out the
71-1_3807.92_4.373.wav_ASR	and i would spend that evenly on that piece of bread
71-1_3812.7_2.72.wav_ASR	then i would close the two of them together
71-1_3816.12_6.32.wav_ASR	you would close um screw the tops back on the jolly and the pendent
71-1_3822.66_0.63.wav_ASR	put them away
71-1_3823.88_1.4.wav_ASR	then i would eat my sandwich
71-1_3832.11_5.6.wav_ASR	well i don't do it often
71-1_3838.45_1.708.wav_ASR	yeah
71-1_3840.85_15.069.wav_ASR	um i would s when i do my language um decide the fact that i do have uh watching machine down there i tend to go to the one longer matthew because i can do all of it at one time
71-1_3856.37_2.654.wav_ASR	and i only wanna do it like once a week or every other week
71-1_3859.024_4.476.wav_ASR	um because it's s just something i find kind of boring to do
71-1_3863.904_3.04.wav_ASR	what i do is
71-1_3868.044_1.74.wav_ASR	fact i have to do this tomorrow
71-1_3870.184_1.23.wav_ASR	so let me think about this
71-1_3871.644_3.54.wav_ASR	oh all of my diary clothes
71-1_3875.33_5.584.wav_ASR	and i usually use the small test um to find out whether n they go into the hammer or not
71-1_3880.914_18.7.wav_ASR	um when i decide that everything needs to be washed which also will include the tools the wash clothes and the other uh tools hand cloth and gloves that are hanging up in the kitchen um i would allow them in
71-1_3900.01_5.52.wav_ASR	we would um use a controller of logo long
71-1_3907.24_0.66.wav_ASR	it would put
71-1_3908.31_4.39.wav_ASR	would carry it to the back side of my the back of my c. d.
71-1_3913.6_8.52.wav_ASR	we would get m i would make sure i had posters or had cards that i could use for the quarter machine in the lounge that i could use for the quarter machine in the lounge
71-1_3923.11_1.57.wav_ASR	um we would go to the garden mate
71-1_3924.88_6.327.wav_ASR	would find the largest machine that was available that i could do all of my language at one time in one machine
71-1_3931.207_5.18.wav_ASR	oh i would put the londer in
71-1_3937.23_12.357.wav_ASR	um if they didn't all that i would make sure that the clothing that could be washed at a higher uh a lower temperature would go into a separate smaller washing machine
71-1_3950.36_1.814.wav_ASR	uh makes sure the soap was in
71-1_3952.46_2.068.wav_ASR	and i would make sure i had enough
71-1_3955.36_6.792.wav_ASR	and then i would probably go by foot or something um they're being lost
71-1_3962.36_0.924.wav_ASR	uh come back
71-1_3963.54_1.44.wav_ASR	they're in the tri band
71-1_3965.86_2.403.wav_ASR	uh i don't really fold them the way i'm supposed to
71-1_3968.54_0.71.wav_ASR	it's just
71-1_3969.66_4.29.wav_ASR	and then put them away kind of um as i used them when i
71-1_3985.92_4.75.wav_ASR	um you mean what would i choose to wear or
71-1_3995.3_0.57.wav_ASR	oh
71-1_3996.39_11.38.wav_ASR	well the first thing i would do every morning is start my coffee because that really is going to have to happen before i make decisions about what matches what
71-1_4008.33_2.38.wav_ASR	oh
71-1_4011.9_2.75.wav_ASR	um i usually do the four over
71-1_4015.51_1.41.wav_ASR	and i would
71-1_4017.61_2.19.wav_ASR	so i usually would grind the cloth
71-1_4020.33_1.78.wav_ASR	start the the water
71-1_4023.83_2.36.wav_ASR	oh i would go into my bed
71-1_4026.63_3.12.wav_ASR	generally i have some idea of what i'm gonna do
71-1_4030.63_3.28.wav_ASR	um if only because i have to dig stuff out somehow
71-1_4033.91_1.26.wav_ASR	and i don't wanna have any
71-1_4035.602_4.45.wav_ASR	you don't i don't really have time to look a lot in the morning
71-1_4040.49_2.54.wav_ASR	so i got an idea of what i'm gonna wear already
71-1_4043.51_5.14.wav_ASR	um so i usually um start well clearly under
71-1_4049.59_3.481.wav_ASR	and then whatever pants or skirt i'm wearing
71-1_4053.071_3.66.wav_ASR	and um that point it the water's usually ready
71-1_4057.231_2.079.wav_ASR	so yeah i got my lines clearly
71-1_4059.631_10.319.wav_ASR	um yeah running around here half dress and then figuring out what kind of shirt i'm gonna wear um whether and then trying to make decisions about how cold it is
71-1_4070.191_1.359.wav_ASR	so i need to
71-1_4071.75_1.32.wav_ASR	or do i need to write it out
71-1_4073.07_2.819.wav_ASR	um well the coppers is being made
71-1_4076.37_2.828.wav_ASR	but the time the copy is made i've got all my basic clothes on
71-1_4079.87_6.666.wav_ASR	then i take the coffee with me um in the background when i make decisions about hair and hair and all that
71-1_4086.94_4.822.wav_ASR	but uh yeah the base is all assembled the night before so i wanna have to worry about it
71-1_4091.79_5.715.wav_ASR	and if i absolutely am tired and don't know what i'm doing i just wrap back because it matches every thing
71-1_4098.11_1.432.wav_ASR	so i have a lot of clothes
71-1_4100.07_0.77.wav_ASR	oh there's that
71-2_14.77_15.16.wav_ASR	um i think my favourite part about where i live and i live on the near east side of the um about a mile away from the capital is that i'm close to the lake
71-2_30.89_1.34.wav_ASR	but
71-2_32.41_2.38.wav_ASR	we we have four different legs that are here
71-2_35.21_8.54.wav_ASR	and and the music actually comes from a word from how chong that actually specifically means four lines
71-2_44.69_5.4.wav_ASR	um so a block away from where i live is uh
71-2_50.725_3.302.wav_ASR	and it's the biggest of the
71-2_54.665_6.7.wav_ASR	and what i like the most about it is there's a bight pass to my
71-2_62.83_6.42.wav_ASR	the layout is too my left um with a running part that goes along it
71-2_70.27_7.38.wav_ASR	and i literally can get pretty much everywhere that i need to go in the city of manhattan without having to
71-2_79.43_1.82.wav_ASR	but i'm very close to the
71-2_82.17_4.02.wav_ASR	so one of the things i do when i run
71-2_86.95_2.98.wav_ASR	so now i would pretty much call it fast walk
71-2_90.071_3.86.wav_ASR	oh no not not from my
71-2_94.531_6.34.wav_ASR	in my time i was i would run about seven or eight miles a morning
71-2_100.931_2.26.wav_ASR	and we would get it down or about seven minutes
71-2_103.351_3.4.wav_ASR	oh it's pretty much just walking and
71-2_107.621_3.7.wav_ASR	and we're more like a eleven minute um miles
71-2_111.741_2.56.wav_ASR	but i usually get about five in every morning
71-2_114.621_7.309.wav_ASR	um it's it's kind of methodistic in the sense that you can look at the wall
71-2_122.181_1.029.wav_ASR	you can see the bird
71-2_123.87_10.3.wav_ASR	um it's just much more um satisfying that it would be to be in a trend
71-2_134.77_3.32.wav_ASR	so it's one of the things i really like about where i live
71-2_139.91_1.36.wav_ASR	it's a trend
71-2_142.244_0.5.wav_ASR	oh
71-2_144.217_0.467.wav_ASR	oh
71-2_144.93_1.073.wav_ASR	but don't think that i'm
71-2_146.764_2.154.wav_ASR	that's the right word that i mean
71-2_149.284_0.5.wav_ASR	you mean
71-2_153.748_0.593.wav_ASR	oh
71-2_155.384_1.306.wav_ASR	oh i just see the word
71-2_156.884_0.526.wav_ASR	well i can see
71-2_157.764_1.566.wav_ASR	oh i'm screwing that
71-2_159.584_0.92.wav_ASR	now i wasn't
71-2_160.706_2.562.wav_ASR	times i hear a word that i already know
71-2_163.426_0.544.wav_ASR	thank you
71-2_164.206_1.044.wav_ASR	that i'm saying that wrong
71-2_165.746_4.624.wav_ASR	um but i i just have to be reacquainted with words that i actually already know
71-2_171.106_0.564.wav_ASR	oh yeah
71-2_173.086_3.54.wav_ASR	go on a date is much better than being on a trendy meal
71-2_177.146_2.769.wav_ASR	yeah and a walk away which is why i like living here
71-2_179.915_0.5.wav_ASR	yeah
71-2_200.31_2.58.wav_ASR	again my speech is not reliable
71-2_204.23_8.987.wav_ASR	but the most part when i speak i know what i'm going to say
71-2_213.77_16.481.wav_ASR	but if i try to say something that's more complicated something that's more advanced um my words don't come out the way that i'd like to say them
71-2_230.251_8.589.wav_ASR	or the words are in my brain but i'm not quite able to articulate them the way that i want to
71-2_238.97_3.38.wav_ASR	um generally i know right away when i made a mistake
71-2_243.091_1.339.wav_ASR	oh but sometimes i don't
71-2_244.631_2.0.wav_ASR	just days i i said to someone
71-2_246.696_3.48.wav_ASR	well we've got the selection coming up and german four
71-2_250.676_1.27.wav_ASR	and she
71-2_253.536_0.404.wav_ASR	or four
71-2_253.94_0.621.wav_ASR	it's it's
71-2_254.576_0.84.wav_ASR	and i said
71-2_255.492_0.747.wav_ASR	what did i say
71-2_256.376_0.528.wav_ASR	yeah
71-2_256.996_0.815.wav_ASR	you said gan you
71-2_258.98_1.021.wav_ASR	well it feels like a
71-2_260.696_3.525.wav_ASR	again i tried to just wing those and figured out a way to get past it
71-2_264.41_8.22.wav_ASR	but i simply cannot trust that what will come out of my mouth is what i'm actually trying to
71-2_273.01_14.82.wav_ASR	and i don't know how to do how to fix that except just to keep it and try to catch them faster i get
71-2_295.73_2.62.wav_ASR	yes i remember exactly when i had a store
71-2_298.52_5.42.wav_ASR	had a stroke on germany first twenty twenty
71-2_320.33_14.302.wav_ASR	so i essentially had a spongy clap stage uh to my right temporal slab and did not know what it was um for two days
71-2_335.13_1.573.wav_ASR	and then of course they added me
71-2_336.703_9.4.wav_ASR	but it was past the window of opportunity to be able to give me some type of ducks that might have um broken the clock
71-2_347.563_2.227.wav_ASR	so i entered the household
71-2_350.403_1.92.wav_ASR	you assumed i would have another scroll
71-2_353.183_0.607.wav_ASR	you have not
71-2_354.09_4.36.wav_ASR	and they have not been able to find the costs of the initial
71-2_359.72_1.67.wav_ASR	it's the perfect scroll
71-2_362.04_12.44.wav_ASR	and so it might have been a concentration of working out really hard uh being stressed because of the pandemonium and not being able to have uh christmas
71-2_374.76_2.765.wav_ASR	those were pre segmentation
71-2_378.52_3.0.wav_ASR	we were in a position then where it was pretty isolated
71-2_381.743_3.632.wav_ASR	and and i don't know what else it could have been
71-2_385.583_5.67.wav_ASR	literally there's there is physically nothing wrong with my body
71-2_391.703_3.994.wav_ASR	and all of my numbers uh indicate that i should not have a stroke
71-2_395.843_2.223.wav_ASR	and yes i had a stroke
71-2_398.363_1.62.wav_ASR	so yeah
71-2_400.181_2.92.wav_ASR	perpetu gum gum gum gum gum gum gum gum gum gum gum gum gum gum gum gum gum gum gum gum gum
71-2_403.981_4.263.wav_ASR	which at some point i um you just move on
71-2_408.721_0.379.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
71-2_418.32_17.68.wav_ASR	um well as i said a week of the recovery has been successful and has not been on um to the direction of the recovery or uh help from any medical
71-2_437.57_8.66.wav_ASR	and i think that's kind of a treasure in the sense that um people will that have
71-2_446.73_3.68.wav_ASR	it was characterized as having a mild scenic
71-2_451.57_12.92.wav_ASR	um we are we are in the position of the potential to come too completely recover if we're given the right kind of treatments and the right kinds of treatments and um certain time
71-2_464.99_16.04.wav_ASR	so i think the first six months after stroke is really cruel in terms of random recovery because you're building on the spongy's recovery um to bring back language
71-2_482.13_11.14.wav_ASR	um i'm really disappointed in the administrative hell in the sense that i was not given what i should have got
71-2_493.53_18.08.wav_ASR	so what i've done on my own is um really increased my the quality of my data which was already um mediocre um slide uh of of idiap
71-2_511.89_1.417.wav_ASR	and i've already s observed that
71-2_513.307_1.654.wav_ASR	you've been doing that about ten years
71-2_515.327_10.103.wav_ASR	um i gave up drawing completely um though i don't really think that was an issue since i was drawing maybe one glass and much
71-2_525.43_10.02.wav_ASR	it might increase to it might increase um but it might increase to it might increase
71-2_536.21_4.1.wav_ASR	it might increase inflammation in my body
71-2_540.325_10.3.wav_ASR	and that's something that i'm trying to work uh very strongly to make sure that i have an in tighty information um
71-2_551.465_1.7.wav_ASR	we've increased my extra size
71-2_553.585_1.6.wav_ASR	again i'm already
71-2_559.81_19.778.wav_ASR	oh i've increased the co ordinate the very conscious cost that i do every single day to make sure that um i can make sure that my focus and uh that um i can make sure that my focus is a really high
71-2_579.588_2.895.wav_ASR	again i was an accident
71-2_582.748_15.385.wav_ASR	so i have alrea always um done a lot of reading every day doing a lot of writing every day trying to develop and we've got a lot of um close work everyday every single day
71-2_598.133_2.617.wav_ASR	you've done it much more correctly than in the past
71-2_601.85_7.16.wav_ASR	um writing is always reliable in the sense that i have the option of
71-2_609.473_2.297.wav_ASR	and i do sometimes the wrong word
71-2_612.753_2.617.wav_ASR	are you you're generally catching it when i add it yeah
71-2_615.79_3.34.wav_ASR	and i always had to add it before the stroke too
71-2_619.37_9.39.wav_ASR	so i don't know to what extent those messages are connected to the stroke um objects or whether that's just the way that i write
71-2_628.91_4.36.wav_ASR	and sometimes uh y you do a a rough draft to get the ideas out
71-2_633.443_2.915.wav_ASR	and then you refine it the second time around
71-2_637.303_9.727.wav_ASR	so i i think the only difference from the way in which i live my life after this drop then before is making sure that i always get enough
71-2_647.963_4.187.wav_ASR	um before the stroke i tried to get sleep
71-2_652.45_7.12.wav_ASR	but if i didn't i just power on because i have a schedule that i have to
71-2_660.87_8.901.wav_ASR	um now it's it's a priority for me to the extent um that i have available to me to make sure that i sleep as much as i can
71-2_670.05_5.06.wav_ASR	um but i just have a reservation every single day that i've all worked
71-2_676.49_0.563.wav_ASR	brilliantly well
71-2_677.41_1.165.wav_ASR	accessories every day
71-2_679.05_2.72.wav_ASR	um push my brain as much as i can
71-2_682.23_7.28.wav_ASR	may try to i made attempt to take back um a language skill
71-2_689.79_3.4.wav_ASR	we were taking spongy glasses before the straw
71-2_693.397_2.653.wav_ASR	um i took print when i was in high school
71-2_696.33_3.6.wav_ASR	but i picked up a little bit of danish when i lived in copenhagen
71-2_701.01_4.263.wav_ASR	but i thought spanish would be much more useful than french is
71-2_706.37_2.1.wav_ASR	so i started taking a spanish clock
71-2_708.69_4.73.wav_ASR	and i had to i had to determine it because it was late at night
71-2_713.57_1.99.wav_ASR	it's just really wasn't working out for me
71-2_716.7_10.19.wav_ASR	but from what i read recently i think one of the things that might be really helpful is to pick up some
71-2_727.56_1.88.wav_ASR	it's i you know i don't
71-2_729.6_1.14.wav_ASR	thought it might be confusing
71-2_731.12_2.971.wav_ASR	why not try it you know
71-2_734.091_1.949.wav_ASR	why not
71-2_736.54_3.066.wav_ASR	oh yeah that may be what i do next
71-2_739.76_1.333.wav_ASR	um what i'm already doing
71-2_767.08_3.158.wav_ASR	see me
71-2_771.54_4.68.wav_ASR	um happy s sad
71-2_779.25_0.7.wav_ASR	um
71-2_782.83_5.9.wav_ASR	gonna talk about my reaction to what happened on nine o'clock and two thousand and two thousand and one
71-2_790.19_2.46.wav_ASR	i was um
71-2_793.11_3.98.wav_ASR	was the beginning of a the spring semester in two thousand and one
71-2_797.09_4.16.wav_ASR	and and my daughter had gone to school
71-2_803.03_9.82.wav_ASR	so as soon as she left uh about eight fifteen i turned i got on the computer because i had to finish my self
71-2_813.15_3.66.wav_ASR	yes i had already sh i i should have already finished my c. d.
71-2_817.67_1.9.wav_ASR	um and it was generally done
71-2_819.73_2.089.wav_ASR	but i was kinda playing with some of the end
71-2_822.23_5.923.wav_ASR	oh my electronic volatiles class because i just wanted to just updated a little bit
71-2_828.41_1.08.wav_ASR	so i wasn't online
71-2_830.33_2.92.wav_ASR	um obviously the radio was not because i had to concentrate
71-2_833.352_4.423.wav_ASR	or or i certainly wasn't watching television when i was trying to do my work
71-2_837.872_12.614.wav_ASR	so i was in this like sponginess with no connection to the outside what's over it's just going through these different articles and designing which one would fit best in terms of what i was trying to do
71-2_851.51_5.54.wav_ASR	and at two o'clock in the afternoon um i was was gonna take a break
71-2_857.21_3.32.wav_ASR	it was gonna go to my job and uh work out
71-2_861.07_1.14.wav_ASR	and it was a beautiful day
71-2_862.61_1.64.wav_ASR	was you know separate
71-2_868.85_0.8.wav_ASR	you turned on
71-2_870.87_3.98.wav_ASR	and the announcer said
71-2_875.69_2.16.wav_ASR	don't really know if the scrolls are gonna close
71-2_878.53_0.64.wav_ASR	like
71-2_879.77_1.12.wav_ASR	the scrolls are gonna close
71-2_881.09_0.48.wav_ASR	oh
71-2_888.143_3.145.wav_ASR	um and i got to the the gem
71-2_892.33_2.473.wav_ASR	and they were televisions um
71-2_895.423_2.206.wav_ASR	you were in the dress when you came in
71-2_897.723_1.36.wav_ASR	that
71-2_899.443_1.827.wav_ASR	everybody looked really sad
71-2_901.963_1.96.wav_ASR	so i i'm walking in there
71-2_904.483_2.874.wav_ASR	thing happened here that i don't know about
71-2_907.37_1.5.wav_ASR	but everybody else knows it
71-2_909.35_2.12.wav_ASR	they're all staring at the screen
71-2_911.55_3.34.wav_ASR	so i went to the section where my trend
71-2_915.83_3.818.wav_ASR	um and again the trends were not anyway here was running along the way
71-2_919.77_3.262.wav_ASR	but that's what i was gonna do that day because i had to do some lip
71-2_923.27_1.915.wav_ASR	and that's what i thought
71-2_925.185_12.8.wav_ASR	but at that point by two and a half in the end they were just replaying it over and over again about the two lines that were hiding it
71-2_938.265_2.813.wav_ASR	and they were introducing people who were trying to get away
71-2_941.365_1.64.wav_ASR	and everything is covered
71-2_944.49_6.22.wav_ASR	and i remember getting on the the trend mile and um you know putting on my headphones and listening to my headphones and listening to my headphones
71-2_951.07_7.56.wav_ASR	and i just kept going faster and faster and faster uh because the addington of what it had was just so sharp
71-2_959.41_3.86.wav_ASR	so i kinda use that you know to uh increase my work
71-2_963.53_2.82.wav_ASR	um and i got out of there
71-2_966.61_1.02.wav_ASR	and i went home and said
71-2_967.91_0.384.wav_ASR	yeah
71-2_968.294_4.966.wav_ASR	got a really close friend um that gives in d. c. that works near the pen
71-2_973.35_2.086.wav_ASR	and so is he
71-2_975.69_0.829.wav_ASR	it's going on
71-2_977.21_0.94.wav_ASR	so i tried to call
71-2_978.45_3.78.wav_ASR	of course i couldn't get through because all the the signals were were d
71-2_982.23_3.06.wav_ASR	um um no one could get home in this
71-2_985.57_1.836.wav_ASR	everything's uh shut
71-2_988.71_2.16.wav_ASR	oh god um i got on um i got on my
71-2_991.09_0.94.wav_ASR	that's the start e mail
71-2_992.31_1.48.wav_ASR	but i email my department
71-2_993.97_1.78.wav_ASR	it's in the it's in the it's in the it's in the it's in the it's in the it's in the it's in the it's in the it's in the it's in the it's in the it's in the
71-2_995.93_0.34.wav_ASR	it's a
71-2_996.81_2.067.wav_ASR	we're gonna have a pineapple on camp
71-2_999.41_1.76.wav_ASR	we're gonna invite the community
71-2_1001.32_2.481.wav_ASR	and we're going to explain what is going on
71-2_1004.36_5.934.wav_ASR	and um uh we're gonna we're gonna explain all of that
71-2_1010.3_3.871.wav_ASR	we're gonna explain the apologies of it
71-2_1014.18_3.5.wav_ASR	we're gonna um talk about the history of
71-2_1018.48_2.588.wav_ASR	we're gonna explain exactly what is going on here
71-2_1021.068_3.442.wav_ASR	and uh everybody got back to me and
71-2_1024.788_2.32.wav_ASR	you mean they everyone responded and said
71-2_1027.288_1.502.wav_ASR	it'd be happy to talk about it
71-2_1029.048_5.302.wav_ASR	it'd be happy to talk about the s things in our room that are going on current
71-2_1034.35_7.22.wav_ASR	and maybe that's related to what's going on with the uh the the borders that are
71-2_1041.762_18.784.wav_ASR	they all we knew at that point that they were coming from the middle east and that they were um attaching the inside and the western um the eastern and the western um
71-2_1060.546_2.0.wav_ASR	and and how it is that we're gonna
71-2_1063.386_1.58.wav_ASR	they were engineers with us
71-2_1066.026_2.694.wav_ASR	um yeah it all came together really
71-2_1069.006_1.514.wav_ASR	we went to bed at one o'clock in the morning
71-2_1071.126_4.007.wav_ASR	um finally got the email back from my friend and d. c. who was fine
71-2_1075.986_3.141.wav_ASR	got up went to campus the next day
71-2_1079.127_3.12.wav_ASR	and all the the lengths were just grand
71-2_1082.467_8.34.wav_ASR	and we didn't just talk about what happened in every single class uh our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after our after
71-2_1091.927_2.073.wav_ASR	oh right that's a lot
71-2_1094.327_0.6.wav_ASR	yeah
71-2_1095.507_3.195.wav_ASR	it was a great power by the way
71-2_1098.702_2.177.wav_ASR	we had i think we had five hundred peels
71-2_1101.002_4.48.wav_ASR	it's standing long uh standing
71-2_1106.562_0.607.wav_ASR	my turn
71-2_1107.262_1.0.wav_ASR	it's standard
71-2_1108.642_3.021.wav_ASR	people had to stand in the back
71-2_1111.942_1.56.wav_ASR	what i'm trying to say is
71-2_1115.89_2.82.wav_ASR	well i've all these phases that i should be able to say
71-2_1118.87_0.92.wav_ASR	my start to say that
71-2_1119.99_1.393.wav_ASR	well i forgot with the in the middle
71-2_1122.11_1.8.wav_ASR	standing room
71-2_1124.33_0.389.wav_ASR	yeah
71-2_1124.719_2.671.wav_ASR	filled up the place basically
71-2_1127.69_1.1.wav_ASR	and everybody's question
71-2_1129.59_0.76.wav_ASR	did they hide us
71-2_1130.57_2.4.wav_ASR	um and that's what we begin with
71-2_1133.59_0.94.wav_ASR	oh
71-2_1136.424_12.445.wav_ASR	but then i missed the whole thing because of course i was on line writing a lecture that i never gave because um you know um circumstances took over
71-2_1189.34_19.84.wav_ASR	well it seems to be taking uh place in uh a newspaper which is relatively um the software which is relatively close to each other
71-2_1209.06_5.336.wav_ASR	or it looks like what's going on is uh a a boy is in the back here
71-2_1214.88_2.2.wav_ASR	and he's playing with his soccer
71-2_1217.52_1.92.wav_ASR	it's protecting his car
71-2_1220.38_11.126.wav_ASR	and unfortunately this time the build the build does the ball doesn't go where he hoped it would go and crashes in to the window
71-2_1232.06_5.1.wav_ASR	it looks like it might have been the window of his next door
71-2_1237.38_1.26.wav_ASR	it could have been his father
71-2_1238.86_0.86.wav_ASR	it's difficult to know
71-2_1239.78_7.2.wav_ASR	but it was um a window that was next to the air in which he was playing um with his stereo
71-2_1247.88_3.96.wav_ASR	well it hit the the glass of the window and broke it
71-2_1252.48_4.08.wav_ASR	and unfortunately there was a man that was sitting in the chair right next to the chip
71-2_1257.78_7.66.wav_ASR	and the softer ball not only broke the window but went through completely into the um the hole
71-2_1266.32_2.88.wav_ASR	apparently they have no screens from what i'm guessing
71-2_1269.48_2.687.wav_ASR	so it can't be discussed because we have smartphones here
71-2_1272.167_11.407.wav_ASR	in the case um the ball ended up in the um in the house um in the room uh in the room
71-2_1284.62_3.27.wav_ASR	and he was not pleased about this
71-2_1288.15_5.76.wav_ASR	he stuck up and looked out the window to try to figure out who had broken the window
71-2_1294.2_1.43.wav_ASR	where did the bulb come from
71-2_1295.93_9.0.wav_ASR	and who is the uh person who had directed that ball towards his window
71-2_1305.71_7.06.wav_ASR	um he's it's clearly that there's going to be some kind of um remotes as a result of this
71-2_1313.51_3.88.wav_ASR	uh because if it's his hand his son is going to be slow
71-2_1317.638_12.22.wav_ASR	and if it's this name um he's gonna expect an apology and probably um some sort of pain to repair the the glass that's been broken
71-2_1331.61_2.368.wav_ASR	so rama in the software
71-2_1351.36_23.18.wav_ASR	well we're gonna tell we're gonna tell this story much uh which um is a a play on the fact that they're apparently was a much older television show which was called before
71-2_1374.637_1.24.wav_ASR	it was very pita
71-2_1376.717_2.203.wav_ASR	ah you know the softer
71-2_1379.217_1.12.wav_ASR	but there is the house one
71-2_1380.877_2.16.wav_ASR	um a faster knows best
71-2_1383.339_19.92.wav_ASR	in any case this particular story is gonna be mostly um i would say as a general more contemporary it may be unnecessary
71-2_1403.327_4.073.wav_ASR	nowadays but in this particular case that's exactly what's happening
71-2_1407.4_17.237.wav_ASR	and and what's going on is um this child and this child's mother needs to take um an umbrella with him when he leads
71-2_1424.637_5.175.wav_ASR	it's and the mother is saying because sh they're getting ready for the boy to go off on his own
71-2_1430.477_1.44.wav_ASR	and the mother is saying
71-2_1432.357_10.134.wav_ASR	it's on what we see um with the clothes that are out of sight and what we see on the whether reports it's gonna rain
71-2_1442.577_1.295.wav_ASR	but i think you should take an arrow
71-2_1443.872_2.02.wav_ASR	and a little boy is going like
71-2_1446.272_1.58.wav_ASR	you're not taking an elephant
71-2_1448.132_1.546.wav_ASR	but i don't need one
71-2_1450.032_1.204.wav_ASR	you don't care if it rain
71-2_1451.572_0.969.wav_ASR	and not gonna
71-2_1453.572_2.904.wav_ASR	um i'm i'm fine on my own
71-2_1457.132_0.708.wav_ASR	so she said
71-2_1458.152_1.904.wav_ASR	well alright you know best
71-2_1460.812_1.116.wav_ASR	you said goodbye
71-2_1462.212_0.403.wav_ASR	yeah
71-2_1462.615_2.1.wav_ASR	if she's still holding the upper
71-2_1465.335_0.768.wav_ASR	he heads out
71-2_1466.655_2.06.wav_ASR	and it's not just a sponge
71-2_1468.935_3.82.wav_ASR	but it really starts to uh range really hard
71-2_1472.915_1.22.wav_ASR	so it's a down problem
71-2_1475.7_2.625.wav_ASR	and um
71-2_1478.655_2.945.wav_ASR	so the um range is getting closer
71-2_1481.94_2.26.wav_ASR	and he's getting really well
71-2_1484.32_4.93.wav_ASR	it's clothes are getting trendy and saturated with the water
71-2_1489.82_1.78.wav_ASR	so he gets about half a bowl
71-2_1492.22_1.78.wav_ASR	and he can't even see what's going on
71-2_1494.3_3.58.wav_ASR	so he heads back to his mother very
71-2_1499.24_0.76.wav_ASR	it looks a lot
71-2_1501.22_2.46.wav_ASR	she has the grade not to say
71-2_1503.88_0.744.wav_ASR	you told you so
71-2_1505.06_1.279.wav_ASR	because mothers know best
71-2_1506.48_1.32.wav_ASR	yeah
71-2_1508.74_1.78.wav_ASR	and he stands there and looks at her
71-2_1510.86_1.98.wav_ASR	should she handle some the upper end
71-2_1513.76_0.96.wav_ASR	you head's off
71-2_1515.14_3.02.wav_ASR	this time remembering in his brain
71-2_1519.26_3.04.wav_ASR	my brother's not always wrong about
71-2_1524.14_4.02.wav_ASR	and le but of course he forgets it by the next week when something else comes up
71-2_1528.48_7.687.wav_ASR	where we are in this week he is now um assured that his mother actually has wisdom which he does not yet have
71-2_1536.5_2.081.wav_ASR	oh sorry
71-2_1555.22_3.121.wav_ASR	well speaking of ramah
71-2_1559.54_8.9.wav_ASR	um what happened here uh began because um the cat was sitting on the porch
71-2_1569.36_3.67.wav_ASR	and the cat has to sit uh sit on the the
71-2_1573.78_3.17.wav_ASR	but the next door um
71-2_1576.95_6.958.wav_ASR	and the dog came out and immediately saw the cat and ran over and started barking at the cat
71-2_1584.11_1.22.wav_ASR	and the cat was bob
71-2_1586.07_5.36.wav_ASR	the cat ran from the the dog and ran up the tree because that was close
71-2_1591.15_6.0.wav_ASR	close and that was a way to get away from the um from the dog um because the dog couldn't climb
71-2_1597.65_2.042.wav_ASR	so the cat climbed up the tree
71-2_1600.41_0.894.wav_ASR	the c. n. k.
71-2_1601.49_6.55.wav_ASR	it's a cat that's just barely uh a kind and isn't really a custom to be that high up
71-2_1608.43_1.61.wav_ASR	um so the cat called up
71-2_1610.78_6.66.wav_ASR	uh the little girl ran out so her cat was up in the tree and called her father and she said
71-2_1619.16_1.18.wav_ASR	card is up and down
71-2_1621.04_3.96.wav_ASR	and she's out on the bar
71-2_1625.76_9.82.wav_ASR	and it doesn't look like she's fighting her way to get back out because she's meowing um you know very loudly and clearly wants to be rescued
71-2_1636.4_1.22.wav_ASR	um so please help me
71-2_1638.16_2.86.wav_ASR	um please help me get my cat out of the tree
71-2_1641.3_3.6.wav_ASR	but the phone's trying to be silverish and the curve
71-2_1645.16_4.36.wav_ASR	so he immediately goes into the garage and finds his laptop
71-2_1650.2_21.487.wav_ASR	um and the plan for him was um he would simply put up the the the ladder got to the the girl's hand his way and hand it to his daughter
71-2_1671.68_2.39.wav_ASR	and then he could be you know the hero
71-2_1674.76_5.62.wav_ASR	he could be um he could fulfil his desires
71-2_1681.42_2.26.wav_ASR	unfortunately he got up in the tree
71-2_1684.54_10.49.wav_ASR	and the ch he hadn't seriously rested the later against the tree in the way he really needed
71-2_1695.33_1.1.wav_ASR	and it's
71-2_1697.33_4.1.wav_ASR	so now we have two people that have to be recorded from the tree
71-2_1701.65_7.1.wav_ASR	we have the cat that is still meowing um loudly uh out in the far
71-2_1709.29_12.14.wav_ASR	and of course the phone can't reach it because he's his wife is uh too heavy to be able to um move into those linos without breaking them down
71-2_1721.65_1.78.wav_ASR	yeah and then he would fall down and
71-2_1724.19_6.76.wav_ASR	so at this point the mother who knows best has called the finder department and said
71-2_1731.81_2.587.wav_ASR	got a got a got a got a got a got a got a got a got a got a got a got a got a got a got a got a got a got a got a got a got a
71-2_1734.59_1.211.wav_ASR	but that isn't what she said
71-2_1735.801_6.58.wav_ASR	but that's what she thought in her brain because she doesn't think them to know about
71-2_1742.881_2.24.wav_ASR	um can you please bring
71-2_1745.553_16.023.wav_ASR	uh unfortunately we now need help from uh firefighters to my husband who's a kind of the cat out of the tree
71-2_1761.576_6.523.wav_ASR	and my daughter is still 'cause she's worried about the cat
71-2_1768.376_1.494.wav_ASR	and now she's wired about a dead
71-2_1770.876_2.274.wav_ASR	and the dog is still barking
71-2_1773.756_3.1.wav_ASR	it's it's about ready
71-2_1777.576_1.228.wav_ASR	it's the powerpights are here
71-2_1779.076_1.061.wav_ASR	they're coming up
71-2_1780.05_2.35.wav_ASR	or and they're going to help the man get down further
71-2_1782.71_3.09.wav_ASR	and they're going to reach out and get the cat
71-2_1786.3_8.752.wav_ASR	uh and what the other's gonna do is she's gonna go and grab the dog and put him in the other room so that everybody will relax a bit
71-2_1796.11_3.213.wav_ASR	it everybody can make it out of the tree without getting hurt
71-2_1799.323_1.586.wav_ASR	oh
71-2_2004.09_16.38.wav_ASR	and uh what we're essentially looking for here is that and what the criteria and what the criteria and what the criteria is that uh women have to possess in order to improve their situation in society
71-2_2021.77_1.86.wav_ASR	so we're gonna start with that
71-2_2023.99_13.24.wav_ASR	um and this is an example of the very restrictive roles that were available to women um in certain colours and certain size
71-2_2038.46_5.74.wav_ASR	um now what we're seeing here are fam a family which is completely mild clashing
71-2_2045.26_10.16.wav_ASR	and the um in both cases what we had uh were two families with children
71-2_2056.56_3.02.wav_ASR	and each of them had a space that did
71-2_2061.01_13.758.wav_ASR	the hasty had one dar um who um who um was leaving with him
71-2_2075.16_1.256.wav_ASR	oh but his wife had died
71-2_2076.416_3.656.wav_ASR	so he had a a young daughter who was about six years old
71-2_2080.296_11.24.wav_ASR	again in uh european society of we'll go back to well let's say nineteen centred um men could not raise their own children
71-2_2091.936_1.731.wav_ASR	you had to have a a a one
71-2_2093.856_0.741.wav_ASR	was for
71-2_2094.68_3.78.wav_ASR	people were v relatively rigid in terms of what they were allowed to
71-2_2099.12_3.78.wav_ASR	so he had to find a wide in order to care for his dogs
71-2_2103.96_13.22.wav_ASR	um in a in a another part of town relatively same social status um we have um a man and a man and wife who had two children
71-2_2118.02_0.76.wav_ASR	and he
71-2_2119.64_8.66.wav_ASR	so the only way that she would be able to survive as a female or find another man that would marry her
71-2_2129.4_2.86.wav_ASR	so they're both out looking for another
71-2_2133.36_1.3.wav_ASR	and they meet each other
71-2_2135.0_28.16.wav_ASR	and and of course what the company is looking for the web is looking for is some one that will take care of his daughter's uh will treat his daughter's very different uh very it will do all the other things that women are supposed to do isn't it
71-2_2164.74_1.14.wav_ASR	so they meet each other
71-2_2166.5_3.74.wav_ASR	and he's got the impression that she's gonna be a wonderful white
71-2_2170.64_3.8.wav_ASR	um she certainly pushes all over his daughter
71-2_2175.66_1.62.wav_ASR	and so they they may
71-2_2177.28_12.12.wav_ASR	there are now three children
71-2_2189.86_2.76.wav_ASR	and they've now blended into this new size
71-2_2193.69_11.26.wav_ASR	oh the the fourth and fulfils his role which is go out and make money for the family and leaves the house uh under the management of the staff
71-2_2205.31_21.673.wav_ASR	oh the smartboard on the other hand has forgotten her memories and is going to be she's going to behave the other boards' and is going to treat the other specialists
71-2_2227.87_6.94.wav_ASR	and for whatever reason the father does not interfere in what he sees when he is home in what he sees when he is alone
71-2_2235.41_10.02.wav_ASR	and so what we have is this this really desirable situation that exists for scenario
71-2_2245.527_4.893.wav_ASR	uh cinderella again had a a beautiful mother who loved her
71-2_2250.667_1.201.wav_ASR	it was close to her father
71-2_2252.027_0.76.wav_ASR	you lost your remote
71-2_2253.147_9.1.wav_ASR	now she's also in this situation where she's clearly um treated differently than her stepdaughters uh steph
71-2_2262.887_2.555.wav_ASR	separate power source array
71-2_2265.442_1.074.wav_ASR	it happens all the time
71-2_2267.022_0.954.wav_ASR	going on
71-2_2269.122_1.278.wav_ASR	again they live inside the
71-2_2270.462_8.32.wav_ASR	there's no way that women can um improve their s their position in the society etcetera
71-2_2279.762_2.46.wav_ASR	it's the only possible option to them
71-2_2282.222_18.073.wav_ASR	um and so their priority is to learn how to manage a house um and also be adaptable to the hardware
71-2_2300.295_2.36.wav_ASR	and i don't know what happens if they're not hardware
71-2_2303.295_2.211.wav_ASR	um i guess they just pack it
71-2_2305.815_2.972.wav_ASR	um in any case that's not part of this particular story
71-2_2309.455_1.22.wav_ASR	uh she's straight
71-2_2310.915_3.032.wav_ASR	and so that's one complication she doesn't have to deal with
71-2_2313.947_8.6.wav_ASR	in any case on the other side of the um at a higher place is
71-2_2323.465_20.82.wav_ASR	and again while the price has essentially uh a lot of economic power and he's at the top of his is actually uh a lot of economic theory and he's at the bottom of his control
71-2_2344.363_9.7.wav_ASR	because the plan is that he will marry a wife and that white will then bear him children
71-2_2354.443_6.44.wav_ASR	and those children then means that there will be um a legacy that will continue on to the next generation
71-2_2361.383_1.861.wav_ASR	so he may not wanna get
71-2_2363.24_6.92.wav_ASR	and we don't really know what his um gender identity is or origin
71-2_2370.56_2.72.wav_ASR	but he's he understands what his job is
71-2_2373.42_1.38.wav_ASR	he has to find a way
71-2_2375.14_1.42.wav_ASR	he has to find a part
71-2_2377.46_11.7.wav_ASR	and his plan is to find some one who's relatively attractive while he focuses it the objectives of his response
71-2_2389.76_4.76.wav_ASR	so um the plan is he's gonna get this over with quick
71-2_2394.609_4.6.wav_ASR	just they're gonna have this huge dance this huge ball
71-2_2400.449_1.88.wav_ASR	the everyone in the kin
71-2_2403.749_2.623.wav_ASR	yeah i'm assuming we're pretty much minimal class and above
71-2_2406.669_3.7.wav_ASR	um he's not really going to the present track um clark
71-2_2410.569_1.731.wav_ASR	it's not part of this
71-2_2413.36_14.64.wav_ASR	um is inviting all of the elderly people who are not married um who would like to be married and make his
71-2_2429.0_1.96.wav_ASR	again this is clearly
71-2_2432.56_5.54.wav_ASR	um it's almost like that battery shape which i've never seen and never would see
71-2_2438.84_2.588.wav_ASR	um but i certainly know a way of it
71-2_2441.428_16.26.wav_ASR	that that woman are gonna be the one that's going to be the one that's gonna be the one that's going to um meet with
71-2_2458.96_11.18.wav_ASR	so anyway all three of these women um the two sis s step sisters and catherine all no that they are elderly
71-2_2470.64_6.62.wav_ASR	and they all start thinking uh about how wonderful their s the situation would be if they get
71-2_2477.759_2.965.wav_ASR	and and again what's interesting is we're not talking about low
71-2_2480.919_2.54.wav_ASR	or not talking about um you know
71-2_2485.819_3.132.wav_ASR	um we're not talking about people that are compatible with each other
71-2_2489.099_5.541.wav_ASR	we're talking about they will some how be attractive enough for this mail to choose them
71-2_2495.14_6.668.wav_ASR	and then their life situation will improve because those of the only options that are available to them
71-2_2502.2_11.34.wav_ASR	and it's a very restrictive society and uh a certain time in in culture which is very very um limiting or feeling
71-2_2514.72_1.813.wav_ASR	so they're they're all getting ready
71-2_2516.76_1.25.wav_ASR	they know what they have to do
71-2_2518.04_0.98.wav_ASR	they have to look at it right
71-2_2519.46_1.52.wav_ASR	so they have to have a really nice draw
71-2_2521.32_1.34.wav_ASR	their hair has to be fixed up
71-2_2522.8_14.67.wav_ASR	but they have to somehow make them stand out from the others in order to be chosen um in this deciding how they're gonna be into it
71-2_2538.05_7.3.wav_ASR	so um because the stepmother favourites her own daughters she loves out whatever money they have
71-2_2545.61_13.82.wav_ASR	and she gets them the the the fanciest dresses that you could possibly choose and you know with uh hair dressers in to get them and they make up and they're make up
71-2_2560.48_2.99.wav_ASR	standard uh
71-2_2563.97_8.22.wav_ASR	so she pulls out um uh a book that she got from her mother which has patterns of dresses
71-2_2572.57_8.51.wav_ASR	because she's very smart and very creative and because she's had to do a lot of the manual work in the house she knows how to to show
71-2_2581.9_5.18.wav_ASR	so she pulls together some um squares of material that are available to her
71-2_2587.26_3.6.wav_ASR	should she put together this quick draw is really
71-2_2591.12_1.64.wav_ASR	you mean it's kinda off the shoulder
71-2_2593.16_3.109.wav_ASR	yeah it's kind of pink uh which kinda plays off her hair
71-2_2597.18_1.602.wav_ASR	and um she's ready to go
71-2_2599.24_1.68.wav_ASR	she's doing the best that she
71-2_2600.92_1.16.wav_ASR	and that's what she has a base
71-2_2602.7_0.86.wav_ASR	and she's ready
71-2_2603.98_2.02.wav_ASR	of course her mother said
71-2_2606.3_1.06.wav_ASR	or no circuit design
71-2_2609.46_2.94.wav_ASR	you are not of our
71-2_2612.88_1.4.wav_ASR	you are a a pen
71-2_2615.14_2.22.wav_ASR	you don't have the right clothes for it
71-2_2617.64_1.2.wav_ASR	you're right correct
71-2_2619.54_0.74.wav_ASR	you are not gonna
71-2_2620.5_1.42.wav_ASR	my daughters are going
71-2_2622.98_4.02.wav_ASR	they the stepisters of course have got their cue from their mom
71-2_2627.22_1.94.wav_ASR	they know to be really really cool to her
71-2_2629.38_1.02.wav_ASR	but they laugh at her
71-2_2631.4_4.92.wav_ASR	and she goes out on the barn um to take care of the animals because that's kind of her job
71-2_2636.32_4.32.wav_ASR	so that's the place where she can go and get some kind of action from the other end
71-2_2641.04_0.764.wav_ASR	and it's all there
71-2_2642.1_1.3.wav_ASR	yeah she's
71-2_2644.4_2.137.wav_ASR	and she's wearing her dress and her
71-2_2647.06_1.593.wav_ASR	or she doesn't know what she's gonna do
71-2_2648.78_0.6.wav_ASR	is she
71-2_2649.62_7.806.wav_ASR	uh what can she possibly do what can't she possibly do to some how get out of the miserable situation that she's in
71-2_2657.46_8.42.wav_ASR	and this very godmother appears to her uh because she's the you know a wonderful person
71-2_2666.1_1.27.wav_ASR	it's getting to other people
71-2_2667.6_1.24.wav_ASR	should she deserves it
71-2_2669.7_4.22.wav_ASR	so this pretty godmother shows up and says
71-2_2674.82_0.58.wav_ASR	are you cool
71-2_2675.52_0.52.wav_ASR	what's wrong
71-2_2676.1_0.7.wav_ASR	what do you mean
71-2_2677.62_0.66.wav_ASR	and she said
71-2_2678.52_2.04.wav_ASR	we would like to go to the the ball
71-2_2680.9_1.26.wav_ASR	but i want to wear
71-2_2682.56_1.04.wav_ASR	don't wanna be left out
71-2_2683.76_3.48.wav_ASR	we wanna have the appropriate clothes that i i
71-2_2687.6_1.84.wav_ASR	you'd be dressed well like everyone
71-2_2689.8_7.06.wav_ASR	and i won't be able to have the same options that my s topics have
71-2_2697.8_0.58.wav_ASR	so she
71-2_2699.7_0.6.wav_ASR	it
71-2_2700.72_5.86.wav_ASR	and she you know use her uses her magic abilities and s
71-2_2707.42_0.56.wav_ASR	he looks
71-2_2708.52_7.98.wav_ASR	and she transforms the rats into horns that will be pulling um a carrot
71-2_2716.86_3.12.wav_ASR	and the cord cable is transformed from a pump
71-2_2721.2_4.98.wav_ASR	and she uses her own and and goes over sindersen's
71-2_2726.24_11.79.wav_ASR	so and all the sound she's wearing these uh outdated uh detailed extremely expensive
71-2_2738.29_8.18.wav_ASR	for hair is is uh made up um and the the the latest
71-2_2747.67_2.25.wav_ASR	um she's got beautiful make up
71-2_2750.27_1.14.wav_ASR	oh she looks gorgeous
71-2_2752.87_4.26.wav_ASR	for uh very godmother says to her
71-2_2758.27_1.606.wav_ASR	go to the board
71-2_2759.97_1.155.wav_ASR	you deserve this
71-2_2761.59_3.96.wav_ASR	uh please understand that this allocation will only last till
71-2_2766.17_5.725.wav_ASR	at a mid night the horses will be transported back in the dark
71-2_2772.51_4.809.wav_ASR	the camera will be transferred back into a spongy
71-2_2778.35_9.98.wav_ASR	and the rags that you're wearing will or the fancy glass that you're wearing will be transparent back in to
71-2_2789.37_2.005.wav_ASR	so please go
71-2_2791.95_0.762.wav_ASR	half an hour
71-2_2792.712_5.46.wav_ASR	and but recognise this is just a moment out of your existence
71-2_2798.512_7.04.wav_ASR	this is a special bulb that um that is that that is hitting your your excess
71-2_2805.892_1.758.wav_ASR	uh it's not really gonna change either
71-2_2808.012_1.558.wav_ASR	please enjoy your morning
71-2_2810.63_3.14.wav_ASR	so she hugs the very god
71-2_2814.41_1.88.wav_ASR	he gets in the code
71-2_2817.21_2.2.wav_ASR	it's taken to the
71-2_2820.33_0.36.wav_ASR	you get
71-2_2821.17_8.52.wav_ASR	even her steph's don't know who this one is because she's dressed so magnificently that she stands out
71-2_2830.55_10.16.wav_ASR	um all they all all the other people that are watching all they can think of is she must be from a really really rich
71-2_2842.35_1.34.wav_ASR	and we don't know of our
71-2_2843.97_3.16.wav_ASR	she must be from a very high social standard
71-2_2847.65_1.71.wav_ASR	and she's clearly very good
71-2_2849.56_5.5.wav_ASR	and i mean the fact that they don't even recognise their own step sister is pretty tricky
71-2_2855.87_1.702.wav_ASR	in any case she walks in
71-2_2858.34_8.7.wav_ASR	uh print's even in his oh format and he's seen her and said
71-2_2867.361_0.856.wav_ASR	it's the standard
71-2_2868.82_1.51.wav_ASR	she's the she's the one
71-2_2870.72_1.77.wav_ASR	um and he adds over to word
71-2_2872.76_1.61.wav_ASR	it immediately looks at
71-2_2874.58_5.47.wav_ASR	he sees that she's also beautiful on top of being well uh clearly witty and well dressed
71-2_2880.91_1.45.wav_ASR	um she's also great
71-2_2882.78_0.91.wav_ASR	it's a wonderful day
71-2_2884.34_0.31.wav_ASR	or
71-2_2885.36_1.74.wav_ASR	there's an automatic
71-2_2887.88_2.89.wav_ASR	and there's there's there's camera between
71-2_2891.62_0.875.wav_ASR	and he said
71-2_2893.18_1.008.wav_ASR	it's thinking it's mind
71-2_2894.42_1.321.wav_ASR	thought this would be a good
71-2_2896.04_2.52.wav_ASR	but i thought this was gonna be a giddy a d. y.
71-2_2898.78_2.795.wav_ASR	but i really like her
71-2_2902.0_1.34.wav_ASR	it is this is this is
71-2_2903.86_2.26.wav_ASR	was hoping for something this ma
71-2_2906.281_1.956.wav_ASR	but i was prepared for something else
71-2_2908.461_1.931.wav_ASR	this this can
71-2_2910.761_2.955.wav_ASR	so he wants to spend time with her as much as he can
71-2_2913.941_0.479.wav_ASR	oh it's a
71-2_2914.681_0.98.wav_ASR	she's into it too
71-2_2915.801_1.52.wav_ASR	you mean they're they're really connected
71-2_2917.761_1.52.wav_ASR	it's just this one's a bug
71-2_2920.001_4.289.wav_ASR	and then she looks up at the clock and sees that it's five minutes to mid night
71-2_2926.49_28.8.wav_ASR	and she's really not this well this is what she's really looks like how she's willing to um that she's really is um that she's really going
71-2_2956.938_4.418.wav_ASR	so he she knows that the legislation will also be gone
71-2_2961.538_9.22.wav_ASR	he she's pretty sure that what he really wanted is the the the trapping the appearances uh all the stuff that goes along with well
71-2_2971.438_5.015.wav_ASR	so she knows this as soon as he sees who she really is um it's gonna be over
71-2_2976.453_4.78.wav_ASR	so she raises as a way as she can because she wants to get away she
71-2_2981.093_8.34.wav_ASR	he doesn't wanna see the look in his eyes when he sees who she really is and what her real status is and how she's really dressed
71-2_2990.23_2.14.wav_ASR	so he's he doesn't understand what he had
71-2_2992.653_0.437.wav_ASR	here's he go
71-2_2993.173_0.717.wav_ASR	what did he say
71-2_2994.053_1.277.wav_ASR	did you say something to
71-2_2995.46_1.51.wav_ASR	there's she had
71-2_2997.36_6.02.wav_ASR	and she raises a way as quickly as she can so quickly that she traps on her shoe
71-2_3003.6_0.62.wav_ASR	sh
71-2_3004.74_1.712.wav_ASR	and um her shoe falls off
71-2_3006.6_1.342.wav_ASR	she doesn't have time to grab it
71-2_3008.32_0.93.wav_ASR	she's gotta get go
71-2_3009.56_0.89.wav_ASR	it's gotta get a way
71-2_3010.96_1.49.wav_ASR	so she makes it around the core
71-2_3012.45_3.64.wav_ASR	and and immediately it happens
71-2_3016.65_9.027.wav_ASR	the the the bold dress um is transformed back into our rugs
71-2_3025.677_7.746.wav_ASR	so the penguin luckily she didn't get in it because i don't know what would have been a matter if she were actually inside the penguin
71-2_3033.917_1.461.wav_ASR	um
71-2_3035.637_0.493.wav_ASR	it's a part
71-2_3036.697_2.343.wav_ASR	and the f the forests are gone
71-2_3039.7_1.22.wav_ASR	oh they're rats again
71-2_3041.9_5.82.wav_ASR	so she walks home snacks in the back because she don't really care what she's doing
71-2_3047.96_2.44.wav_ASR	it could be out in the j the bar or whatever
71-2_3051.18_1.98.wav_ASR	and she remembers her
71-2_3053.64_0.44.wav_ASR	sh
71-2_3054.52_2.96.wav_ASR	uh i got to see what it was like to be on the other side of it
71-2_3058.28_1.562.wav_ASR	oh maybe i can be content
71-2_3059.842_2.694.wav_ASR	or maybe there's some other way that i can get out of here
71-2_3062.542_1.178.wav_ASR	at least i had
71-2_3064.362_9.62.wav_ASR	least i know that if i had the appropriate clothes um i could i could walk into a a society at that level and i could
71-2_3075.322_2.431.wav_ASR	in the meantime he's back in the palace
71-2_3078.142_1.402.wav_ASR	um he's shaking after
71-2_3079.8_11.914.wav_ASR	it's you know kind of uh th the psychology of what's going on in his brain is got all these women are throwing themselfs at him but also she's laughing hard to get because she's laughing hard
71-2_3092.42_1.26.wav_ASR	so there's kind of a mixture
71-2_3093.8_0.92.wav_ASR	you skip the show
71-2_3095.48_0.44.wav_ASR	and he's a
71-2_3096.62_2.419.wav_ASR	and i want that one
71-2_3099.039_1.554.wav_ASR	he says that to his father
71-2_3101.459_0.874.wav_ASR	uh i will get married
71-2_3102.659_1.457.wav_ASR	don't do everything you want me to do
71-2_3104.319_1.26.wav_ASR	or fulfill my obligations
71-2_3106.019_2.317.wav_ASR	but i'm only gonna remember a one i wanna be with
71-2_3108.479_1.188.wav_ASR	and i decided to it is
71-2_3109.899_0.481.wav_ASR	it's her
71-2_3110.579_0.492.wav_ASR	the print
71-2_3111.559_1.82.wav_ASR	the mister
71-2_3113.739_1.359.wav_ASR	um and i got a shoe
71-2_3115.098_9.104.wav_ASR	so all i have to do now is go round and see if i can figure out who's foot who's foot who'll fit into that shoe
71-2_3124.478_2.226.wav_ASR	and then that will be the person
71-2_3126.704_14.559.wav_ASR	um because he's beginning to understand in his mind that there are some limitations of this society which is that there are many meetings that trended their superficialities and how much money they make
71-2_3141.263_17.44.wav_ASR	and he's beginning to think if the their souls could just they could just be so engaged but that would be something that um it could exist uh regularly of what their initial position in society was
71-2_3158.75_4.86.wav_ASR	so he's thinking at this point he's thinking much more broadly than his father is
71-2_3163.91_2.82.wav_ASR	and so they've got this this this bar
71-2_3167.87_7.62.wav_ASR	if he can find a one who's feet in to those glasses he will know who that person is
71-2_3175.61_0.918.wav_ASR	then it'll look at her
71-2_3176.528_4.36.wav_ASR	and it'll be able to know that that's the person that his is true
71-2_3181.928_1.599.wav_ASR	that's the person that he will be
71-2_3184.23_8.169.wav_ASR	and because the way society works is if you're rich you can marry down but if you're uh but but it has to be their choice
71-2_3192.59_7.512.wav_ASR	if you're poor and you wanna matter up um you're gonna be used as some kind of solar carrier
71-2_3200.21_5.812.wav_ASR	so you pretty much need um someone rich to reach down in some way
71-2_3207.09_0.38.wav_ASR	so
71-2_3208.27_0.924.wav_ASR	if he's mail
71-2_3209.37_0.56.wav_ASR	sh
71-2_3210.23_5.02.wav_ASR	and given the periodic limits of them she doesn't get to ask him
71-2_3215.67_1.58.wav_ASR	he has to ask per
71-2_3217.53_2.64.wav_ASR	and this is this goes back two hundred years
71-2_3220.23_10.62.wav_ASR	and this is the way in which um ergonomically uh two their depth um in terms of what people could actually do
71-2_3232.95_1.66.wav_ASR	so um he's going around
71-2_3234.63_9.058.wav_ASR	and and of course this is clearly a very interesting way to find the partner that he's actually looking for the mystery one who got away
71-2_3244.37_1.53.wav_ASR	but he's no he's not what to do
71-2_3246.27_1.395.wav_ASR	you mean it's upgraded
71-2_3248.05_0.952.wav_ASR	it's the one i want
71-2_3249.19_4.215.wav_ASR	um who saw the one you know with the the great carrot
71-2_3253.405_1.7.wav_ASR	again you just call this a target
71-2_3255.445_1.264.wav_ASR	everybody's looking for
71-2_3256.825_0.684.wav_ASR	they can't mind
71-2_3258.025_3.705.wav_ASR	so we're gonna start with the the show because he's got something in front of him
71-2_3262.625_10.345.wav_ASR	and they advertise that he will be going city to sitty to see if women would come forward um to see if you can find the woman that will fit the shoe
71-2_3273.59_2.54.wav_ASR	so of course the standards
71-2_3276.77_4.492.wav_ASR	you he passes us by um the night of the ball
71-2_3281.67_5.34.wav_ASR	but all we gotta do is get our feet to fit into that shoe
71-2_3287.15_7.66.wav_ASR	of course they're looking at this in a really superficial kind of way because he knows that as soon as he finds the right one
71-2_3298.01_6.16.wav_ASR	and clearly even if those shoes did fit the step dancers it wouldn't matter
71-2_3304.47_1.08.wav_ASR	or a bio
71-2_3305.92_1.24.wav_ASR	check there'd be no camera
71-2_3307.5_1.43.wav_ASR	yeah they don't understand that
71-2_3309.14_4.5.wav_ASR	her really uh behind in terms of understanding human relationship
71-2_3314.91_9.46.wav_ASR	uh cinderella is she knows if she has the opportunity to connect with him again he can take her out of the situation that she's in
71-2_3324.63_1.94.wav_ASR	and they did correct
71-2_3326.99_0.66.wav_ASR	they shouldn't
71-2_3327.87_0.666.wav_ASR	but they did
71-2_3328.77_1.6.wav_ASR	um it was very imp
71-2_3331.15_16.88.wav_ASR	but for whatever reason because of the the precedence to step out of her role and move into a um uh the press is been given that opportunity to step out of her role and move into a um
71-2_3349.85_4.94.wav_ASR	so when they come up to the house both of the step daughters go
71-2_3355.33_3.9.wav_ASR	may try very hard to see if their feet will fit into the shoe
71-2_3359.65_1.118.wav_ASR	and they they don't
71-2_3361.07_2.251.wav_ASR	doing everything that he can
71-2_3363.39_2.46.wav_ASR	in this point the price is just very
71-2_3366.67_1.663.wav_ASR	it's just gonna find it again
71-2_3368.45_4.78.wav_ASR	and and he'll be stuck with somebody else that his father will probably arrange for him
71-2_3374.21_1.02.wav_ASR	and he finally said
71-2_3375.45_9.07.wav_ASR	there's any other woman in this house who could possibly be eligible for this
71-2_3385.34_2.26.wav_ASR	and cinderella
71-2_3388.1_5.46.wav_ASR	and this is the brightest thing she's ever done because her stepmother is just gonna punish her for this after
71-2_3394.22_0.66.wav_ASR	and she said
71-2_3395.354_0.61.wav_ASR	um here
71-2_3396.64_1.68.wav_ASR	the standard buttons and looks at
71-2_3398.32_11.3.wav_ASR	or she's ready to you know clearly to punish her and and damage her out to the barn um prevent her not to eat for a while and really really make her life miserable
71-2_3410.66_4.26.wav_ASR	um but the purpose that's working with the press
71-2_3415.8_1.04.wav_ASR	he said everyone but
71-2_3417.006_1.52.wav_ASR	come on
71-2_3419.206_5.75.wav_ASR	and she steps forward directly the fact that she's being glare at by the family member
71-2_3426.49_1.26.wav_ASR	and she sits down
71-2_3428.266_4.56.wav_ASR	and her what fits the shoe
71-2_3433.786_1.224.wav_ASR	the print looks at her
71-2_3435.486_0.884.wav_ASR	her eyes me
71-2_3437.19_5.92.wav_ASR	and once again he knows he's made his
71-2_3444.51_11.84.wav_ASR	and at that point all of the power that the print has um to be able to protect her from her stepmother is kind of and four
71-2_3457.31_6.494.wav_ASR	um all of our beautiful clothes come back though we're beginning to think this might have been in the offer in the first place
71-2_3465.03_1.22.wav_ASR	the stepmother said
71-2_3467.17_0.966.wav_ASR	it's out of my hand
71-2_3468.27_3.048.wav_ASR	or i had no ability to function her anymore
71-2_3471.91_15.74.wav_ASR	and the price pulls her out of the and brings her back to the colours um which she will be uh a much higher standard than she um has been
71-2_3488.11_2.18.wav_ASR	it's just gonna have to learn how to
71-2_3490.38_2.51.wav_ASR	or she's gonna have to learn how to talk back
71-2_3493.22_6.463.wav_ASR	she's gonna have to learn um how to connect herself as a lady
71-2_3500.06_5.22.wav_ASR	all the things that are associated with a higher social class
71-2_3505.28_7.11.wav_ASR	um but because they connect at a human level um this is gonna work
71-2_3569.68_4.16.wav_ASR	was just thinking about telling you about the one i told you last
71-2_3574.16_1.744.wav_ASR	so i have to come up with a new one and that
71-2_3575.904_16.746.wav_ASR	um when i was in the third grade which means i was very good with being able to read a class
71-2_3594.17_4.66.wav_ASR	but there were some details that i was not completely clear about
71-2_3599.49_5.1.wav_ASR	one of those is what is a quarter after on a clay
71-2_3606.01_7.8.wav_ASR	um i mean i certainly knew that the shorter handle or hand was the audio
71-2_3614.27_3.18.wav_ASR	and the wrong handle was the min
71-2_3618.41_10.9.wav_ASR	um but from my perspective from my in my eight euro brand when someone said twenty five after or a quarter after it made twenty
71-2_3629.95_0.94.wav_ASR	didn't mean fifteen
71-2_3632.237_7.116.wav_ASR	and what it happened is my older sister was had stayed home sick that day
71-2_3640.43_4.54.wav_ASR	and i was supposed to go to her administrative school
71-2_3645.277_2.053.wav_ASR	it was in the it's great
71-2_3647.95_6.86.wav_ASR	and i was supposed to get her home tomorrow and bring it home to her so that she could do a work and she could return it the next day
71-2_3655.69_1.8.wav_ASR	and so i went to my teacher and
71-2_3657.81_4.4.wav_ASR	it's supposed to go to um mister
71-2_3662.55_3.64.wav_ASR	and i'm supposed to pick up my sisters' homework
71-2_3667.09_0.66.wav_ASR	and she said
71-2_3668.13_1.372.wav_ASR	why don't you go a quarter after
71-2_3669.502_1.648.wav_ASR	so i said
71-2_3671.37_0.632.wav_ASR	yeah i will
71-2_3672.79_7.687.wav_ASR	thoughts after was twenty five minutes after because s in my mind that's what made sense
71-2_3680.63_1.36.wav_ASR	the colour is twenty five min
71-2_3682.55_2.16.wav_ASR	it's a quarter is worth twenty five cents
71-2_3685.29_6.464.wav_ASR	so quarter after would be three twenty five not three which is what she's saying
71-2_3691.83_1.241.wav_ASR	quarter after the hour
71-2_3693.83_6.8.wav_ASR	so i waited till three twenty five which is five minutes before the scroll is is closed
71-2_3701.57_3.218.wav_ASR	it's way too late for me to be going and doing what i'm supposed to be doing
71-2_3704.71_1.76.wav_ASR	but i was supposed to done it ten minutes earlier
71-2_3706.77_5.92.wav_ASR	and i'm watching the clock until it's exactly three twenty five and getting up and going to doing what i'm supposed to do
71-2_3713.17_1.54.wav_ASR	and i ran over
71-2_3715.13_4.3.wav_ASR	of course it's a mess because i'm missing the end of my clasp
71-2_3720.41_4.7.wav_ASR	um her class is p. f. t. s class is closing down
71-2_3726.15_4.02.wav_ASR	so i get back to my class probably at three thirty five
71-2_3730.99_3.236.wav_ASR	my teacher is still waiting there because my stop is still in the dust
71-2_3734.91_1.24.wav_ASR	did you wait so long
71-2_3736.33_0.6.wav_ASR	yeah
71-2_3737.07_2.17.wav_ASR	we went exactly when you told me to go
71-2_3739.78_1.66.wav_ASR	you told me to go back
71-2_3742.38_0.58.wav_ASR	and she said
71-2_3743.24_2.52.wav_ASR	oh you didn't go till three twenty five
71-2_3746.02_0.42.wav_ASR	you said
71-2_3746.78_1.46.wav_ASR	but isn't that
71-2_3749.18_19.93.wav_ASR	and so at the age of eight i understood finally that when a double as they're referring to a clock that they mean fifteen five minutes after an hour and not twenty five minutes after and before
71-2_3769.95_0.381.wav_ASR	how's
71-2_3770.47_0.576.wav_ASR	it's i don't know
71-2_3783.83_0.927.wav_ASR	yeah well t. v.
71-2_3784.77_0.667.wav_ASR	uh
71-2_3785.65_0.876.wav_ASR	smile
71-2_3786.87_2.118.wav_ASR	you should have you know a quarter after the hour
71-2_3788.988_1.9.wav_ASR	or
71-2_3791.248_1.687.wav_ASR	they just won't clear about
71-2_3793.668_2.282.wav_ASR	now that i actually talked back to
71-2_3796.328_1.262.wav_ASR	you mean i was in
71-2_3797.748_1.362.wav_ASR	you never talk back to any
71-2_3799.368_1.8.wav_ASR	oh right it's just really cute
71-2_3809.35_6.62.wav_ASR	um
71-2_3816.149_18.351.wav_ASR	um i think to talk about this story i think i'm going to talk about when i learned how to write a turkey because at the time when i did it i was asked if i could bake the bird
71-2_3836.08_11.38.wav_ASR	and of course um growing up in an extended family and which we had very very huge things i never made my own thanks giving by my own hands
71-2_3847.78_2.32.wav_ASR	uh generally we would go to my grandmother's house
71-2_3850.98_1.12.wav_ASR	and she had a left shoulder
71-2_3852.94_2.427.wav_ASR	so um our job
71-2_3855.367_3.059.wav_ASR	but my father was the second oldest of that family
71-2_3859.04_2.22.wav_ASR	our job was to bring some pigs
71-2_3861.92_7.327.wav_ASR	and usually we would bring something else whether it would be grand battery or something else uh red
71-2_3869.707_2.393.wav_ASR	uh we never made the tur
71-2_3872.607_2.173.wav_ASR	you were never responsible for doing any of
71-2_3874.78_1.654.wav_ASR	uh
71-2_3876.434_0.914.wav_ASR	or be plenty of
71-2_3877.82_5.48.wav_ASR	you know i'd hang up with my in the kitchen with the window because they were kind of restricted that
71-2_3883.46_1.96.wav_ASR	the menu would be in the living room watching fruit bowl
71-2_3886.28_4.902.wav_ASR	yeah you would just try to deal with those um
71-2_3891.42_2.44.wav_ASR	but anyway i was by myself
71-2_3893.937_6.46.wav_ASR	oh i was um i was i was a senior in
71-2_3903.017_2.6.wav_ASR	but i was working as a waiter
71-2_3906.217_1.753.wav_ASR	and i didn't i didn't have a card
71-2_3909.03_2.46.wav_ASR	and i couldn't get enough time off from work
71-2_3911.917_1.736.wav_ASR	you didn't have enough silver there
71-2_3913.653_4.9.wav_ASR	or so for whatever reason i had to work on windows before things
71-2_3919.253_1.48.wav_ASR	and i was gonna describe
71-2_3920.873_2.933.wav_ASR	but i was gonna miss this big family uh end
71-2_3924.413_4.96.wav_ASR	but i decided that i was still going to make sure that i had the trapping
71-2_3929.773_1.74.wav_ASR	but i still had
71-2_3931.715_1.84.wav_ASR	but i still had
71-2_3934.135_1.48.wav_ASR	that i still had trends
71-2_3935.995_1.437.wav_ASR	but those are the things i like it
71-2_3937.995_2.438.wav_ASR	so i was gonna go through this 'cause now i'm in doubt right
71-2_3940.455_1.144.wav_ASR	and i know how to do all that
71-2_3941.995_1.475.wav_ASR	um why shouldn't i be able to do it
71-2_3943.535_0.973.wav_ASR	it can't be hard
71-2_3945.135_1.145.wav_ASR	it comes on the t. v.
71-2_3946.495_1.92.wav_ASR	it looks like you turned that of an hour
71-2_3948.615_1.065.wav_ASR	put the
71-2_3949.895_1.065.wav_ASR	you leave it in for a long
71-2_3951.06_1.38.wav_ASR	and then you pull it
71-2_3952.98_1.427.wav_ASR	then you
71-2_3954.407_0.765.wav_ASR	you can do that
71-2_3956.5_5.3.wav_ASR	um the tuesday before thanksgiving after i'm called
71-2_3962.12_0.88.wav_ASR	and everyone's
71-2_3963.12_1.013.wav_ASR	or not gonna be here
71-2_3964.3_1.612.wav_ASR	you can't believe you're not gonna be
71-2_3965.912_1.841.wav_ASR	and feeling all the pride in all this
71-2_3967.94_2.64.wav_ASR	but i get how i pick up this
71-2_3970.948_2.557.wav_ASR	and i don't get a particularly big one
71-2_3973.708_0.995.wav_ASR	it's pretty big
71-2_3974.748_3.832.wav_ASR	probably like twenty pounds which is certainly more than i need
71-2_3979.388_1.599.wav_ASR	um but you know i don't know
71-2_3981.128_5.18.wav_ASR	smaller than the ones that my family has ever used for things
71-2_3986.648_1.44.wav_ASR	so i pick up this
71-2_3989.32_4.94.wav_ASR	um after i got home from work on wednesday i pulled it out of the fridge
71-2_3994.86_1.6.wav_ASR	yeah kinda see what i'm going here with that
71-2_3997.14_1.16.wav_ASR	and plug it out of the fridge
71-2_3998.92_0.655.wav_ASR	and s
71-2_3999.94_8.707.wav_ASR	yeah i probably if i put it in the morning on thursday morning um i should be able to eat probably like four o'clock in the afternoon
71-2_4008.6_3.427.wav_ASR	yeah and you know i heard you know how to make pies and all the other stuff
71-2_4012.36_2.28.wav_ASR	um
71-2_4015.16_2.54.wav_ASR	put tin foil over it
71-2_4018.12_1.74.wav_ASR	got the template core
71-2_4020.98_0.76.wav_ASR	you put it in
71-2_4022.48_2.3.wav_ASR	and you know in the mean time i'm getting really hungry
71-2_4025.22_1.08.wav_ASR	so the day is going
71-2_4026.96_2.58.wav_ASR	the other smells really good
71-2_4030.16_1.799.wav_ASR	um i've already got the pigs that are
71-2_4032.82_2.322.wav_ASR	so i thought the price 'cause i don't have time to back them up
71-2_4035.7_1.44.wav_ASR	oh no
71-2_4037.36_0.82.wav_ASR	and i'm watching t. v.
71-2_4038.6_1.326.wav_ASR	and so it's about four clocks
71-2_4040.14_5.623.wav_ASR	and i identified my next door neighbour to come over and help thanks giving with me sharing with me
71-2_4045.6_2.7.wav_ASR	me and i poured out the oil
71-2_4048.88_8.18.wav_ASR	uh i po i opened the other door pulled out the the the turkey and take off the the tin foil
71-2_4058.22_5.156.wav_ASR	and also kind of rah on the top
71-2_4063.76_1.56.wav_ASR	um
71-2_4065.473_3.02.wav_ASR	and what apparently i didn't understand you had to follow them
71-2_4068.773_3.506.wav_ASR	yeah i didn't know that they're actually less expensive
71-2_4072.673_10.555.wav_ASR	um what i have is a tricky which is over looked on the bottom quite unook on the top part of it
71-2_4083.413_1.1.wav_ASR	it's bugged
71-2_4084.791_4.6.wav_ASR	or or you don't need to when you wiggle it is speech
71-2_4089.731_1.877.wav_ASR	um having blood coming out of it
71-2_4092.3_1.672.wav_ASR	so i've got my next target
71-2_4094.631_1.127.wav_ASR	so why are we gonna eat
71-2_4095.771_0.429.wav_ASR	it's
71-2_4096.271_1.769.wav_ASR	well it looks like it's not done
71-2_4098.231_1.569.wav_ASR	oh no why it's taking this long
71-2_4101.011_1.629.wav_ASR	um and i so
71-2_4103.091_0.989.wav_ASR	let's just see the top
71-2_4104.66_1.34.wav_ASR	so i put it back in the cup
71-2_4106.3_0.82.wav_ASR	we edit the power
71-2_4107.6_2.94.wav_ASR	um we start eating you know whatever i got in the house
71-2_4110.92_3.32.wav_ASR	like keeping the other door and charging yeah
71-2_4114.46_1.1.wav_ASR	oh no
71-2_4115.9_3.62.wav_ASR	oh
71-2_4119.66_2.687.wav_ASR	oh no i'm not really hungry anymore because we've been eating
71-2_4122.347_5.32.wav_ASR	and i think i had some macro and chips in the um uh refrigerator
71-2_4127.947_0.653.wav_ASR	we didn't
71-2_4128.987_0.853.wav_ASR	you already have the top
71-2_4130.887_1.513.wav_ASR	um you know we're eating other stuff
71-2_4132.587_2.053.wav_ASR	think we're drinking beer pretty much of that point
71-2_4135.127_1.673.wav_ASR	and it's still just wasn't
71-2_4136.987_0.32.wav_ASR	well
71-2_4137.427_1.789.wav_ASR	think there's something wrong with my
71-2_4139.216_4.64.wav_ASR	for whatever reason this bird did not cut
71-2_4144.716_6.64.wav_ASR	so basically um i finally took it out of the oven and stuck it back in the refrigerator
71-2_4152.1_1.576.wav_ASR	um it was half
71-2_4154.1_6.54.wav_ASR	and then i found out the next day from my ant that it was supposed to be hard probably three or four days in advance
71-2_4161.66_3.14.wav_ASR	um
71-2_4164.8_10.968.wav_ASR	and i never told anybody other than my grandkids that the reason that my daughter did not work out is not because i forgot the thought
71-2_4175.98_2.66.wav_ASR	but because i told the other just didn't work
71-2_4178.98_0.94.wav_ASR	yeah that's the
71-2_4180.26_1.499.wav_ASR	but that's the one i want with right
71-2_4181.86_0.46.wav_ASR	you did not
71-2_4182.62_1.64.wav_ASR	they would have laughed at me for
71-2_4184.269_5.704.wav_ASR	or they'd record me for deadlines for not knowing something as basic as that
71-2_4190.749_3.091.wav_ASR	but it's the first um bird i ever tried to
71-2_4194.709_2.56.wav_ASR	it's it's you need to tell you the details
71-2_4197.749_2.931.wav_ASR	yeah there's more in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the
71-2_4201.309_1.4.wav_ASR	so anyway yeah
71-2_4202.869_1.276.wav_ASR	oh i
71-2_4204.145_0.66.wav_ASR	you didn't take
71-2_4205.385_11.22.wav_ASR	the next was actually inside the paper and it was stuck inside the curve which i didn't even know because it was too frustrating
71-2_4217.465_4.355.wav_ASR	when i finally was able to get it out i had paper in there too on top
71-2_4222.245_1.467.wav_ASR	yeah kind of a mouse
71-2_4223.712_2.033.wav_ASR	so uh eventually i ate it
71-2_4225.772_5.36.wav_ASR	um i just hacked it up then kind of cut it in
71-2_4231.613_1.392.wav_ASR	it's but
71-2_4244.36_0.39.wav_ASR	it's
71-2_4246.12_3.22.wav_ASR	um oh okay
71-2_4250.31_12.91.wav_ASR	um going to talk about uh how tell that i stayed in when i was living in copenhagen um and was travelling with five other people
71-2_4263.273_6.26.wav_ASR	now in this particular case uh what it had is we were on christmas break
71-2_4270.133_3.68.wav_ASR	so we had a month off in which they were no class
71-2_4274.793_1.429.wav_ASR	and so
71-2_4276.413_2.08.wav_ASR	we're about twenty five of us there
71-2_4278.663_5.439.wav_ASR	we were between the ages of ninety and twenty one and were in europe
71-2_4284.483_8.28.wav_ASR	and we have the ability to be able to buy new lasers
71-2_4293.323_0.72.wav_ASR	you're basically
71-2_4294.543_3.437.wav_ASR	uh i can't remember what it cost at this point
71-2_4297.98_2.54.wav_ASR	but i think it was about a hundred dollars you paid
71-2_4300.82_16.44.wav_ASR	you could otherwise go anyway um anyway as far as it was on this uh this role
71-2_4317.626_3.34.wav_ASR	so yeah we had all these ways of trying to do it cheap
71-2_4321.286_2.024.wav_ASR	oh we'll sleep on on train
71-2_4323.546_4.404.wav_ASR	we would take things at night so that we wouldn't have to worry about a
71-2_4328.866_1.9.wav_ASR	but um
71-2_4331.086_2.44.wav_ASR	were several of us that were travelling
71-2_4333.686_1.58.wav_ASR	was with a friend called kappy
71-2_4335.298_4.36.wav_ASR	and we were connecting in with spongy and cabby
71-2_4339.721_2.975.wav_ASR	and um and we were they were coming
71-2_4342.838_1.313.wav_ASR	you attached from somewhere else
71-2_4344.198_2.045.wav_ASR	we're all gonna meet together in room
71-2_4346.718_4.949.wav_ASR	and we figured we would all stay in a hotel together um to save money you know
71-2_4351.738_2.52.wav_ASR	you would have i think two b
71-2_4354.57_1.472.wav_ASR	um so there was a cable
71-2_4356.47_1.518.wav_ASR	and one of us would sleep with a cat
71-2_4357.988_3.735.wav_ASR	and and then two women would be in the other the other but
71-2_4362.65_1.8.wav_ASR	so it's n. u. e. right
71-2_4364.61_1.672.wav_ASR	um because this is christmas page
71-2_4366.73_2.06.wav_ASR	we adore in r
71-2_4369.51_2.46.wav_ASR	and the first thing we we would do
71-2_4372.105_3.44.wav_ASR	and we were gonna c meet with each other at the training stage
71-2_4376.45_1.74.wav_ASR	um we all met at the train station
71-2_4378.485_2.025.wav_ASR	we all got in with then half an hour of each other
71-2_4380.725_0.585.wav_ASR	we connect
71-2_4381.31_17.334.wav_ASR	and the first thing we would always do is go to the um the information centred in the trends and get the maps and find out what's going on in the in the communication and where the cheap outlines are and you know basically what we're gonna be doing
71-2_4399.31_1.66.wav_ASR	there's a guy there
71-2_4400.97_1.48.wav_ASR	and he was about twenty
71-2_4402.65_5.436.wav_ASR	um very attractive alternative man who said
71-2_4408.77_2.324.wav_ASR	but he was just starting with that too so
71-2_4410.93_1.58.wav_ASR	or they're three average man
71-2_4412.97_0.805.wav_ASR	the one guy
71-2_4414.09_1.187.wav_ASR	he's struggling with us
71-2_4415.73_2.32.wav_ASR	and and he just said
71-2_4418.51_1.44.wav_ASR	oh you're gonna be in
71-2_4420.19_0.352.wav_ASR	it's
71-2_4420.542_1.785.wav_ASR	had yeah we're gonna be f in a couple of days
71-2_4423.022_0.528.wav_ASR	your plan
71-2_4423.642_1.191.wav_ASR	so we don't have plain
71-2_4425.142_0.92.wav_ASR	we're just
71-2_4426.362_1.68.wav_ASR	we're open to any experiment
71-2_4428.462_0.4.wav_ASR	he said
71-2_4428.922_1.677.wav_ASR	we're gonna be having a party tonight
71-2_4431.182_1.62.wav_ASR	would you like to come to our party
71-2_4433.777_1.345.wav_ASR	and of course you know
71-2_4435.601_1.401.wav_ASR	course we'll come to your party
71-2_4437.262_1.273.wav_ASR	we don't know anybody here
71-2_4438.722_1.324.wav_ASR	of course we'll come to your parties
71-2_4440.046_0.685.wav_ASR	so
71-2_4440.731_1.855.wav_ASR	we lumped to an entire party
71-2_4442.966_1.106.wav_ASR	yeah
71-2_4444.486_4.06.wav_ASR	as seen the movie the take and take which means it coulda gone very different
71-2_4448.786_0.842.wav_ASR	that's not what
71-2_4450.606_1.32.wav_ASR	so we get to our hotel
71-2_4453.086_0.895.wav_ASR	and we check it
71-2_4454.966_4.62.wav_ASR	um the guy behind the desk looked at all of us and said
71-2_4459.59_1.88.wav_ASR	do you all want to be in one room together
71-2_4462.21_0.62.wav_ASR	um we s
71-2_4463.448_1.886.wav_ASR	well one room two beds
71-2_4466.53_1.558.wav_ASR	to he looked at cavin
71-2_4468.088_2.082.wav_ASR	and and he pulled them aside and said
71-2_4470.79_1.3.wav_ASR	you must not be a cable
71-2_4472.41_4.094.wav_ASR	if i were in that room i would not be able to speak the entire night
71-2_4476.504_3.19.wav_ASR	they're their entire night with all of these beautiful women around
71-2_4480.57_2.338.wav_ASR	and uh haven't come out yet
71-2_4482.944_3.806.wav_ASR	but uh about a year later after that when we all had a routine
71-2_4487.104_0.926.wav_ASR	now i'm i'm gay
71-2_4488.81_0.614.wav_ASR	yeah
71-2_4489.544_1.514.wav_ASR	oh we we didn't know that
71-2_4491.584_4.638.wav_ASR	yeah but i was thinking at the time you know he he actually didn't know he was gay
71-2_4496.25_7.099.wav_ASR	but he said one of the things that made clear to him that he was gay as well that
71-2_4504.19_3.358.wav_ASR	it wouldn't be able to sleep if i were in the room with these beautiful women
71-2_4508.07_0.96.wav_ASR	and he was thinking
71-2_4509.29_1.838.wav_ASR	you know i'm not interested in that
71-2_4511.51_1.94.wav_ASR	yeah
71-2_4513.97_1.867.wav_ASR	well maybe there's a reason for that
71-2_4515.85_1.695.wav_ASR	yeah
71-2_4518.19_2.637.wav_ASR	so we g i actually stopped with cat
71-2_4520.91_0.704.wav_ASR	oh that was
71-2_4523.37_1.48.wav_ASR	you mean there was no
71-2_4525.51_3.045.wav_ASR	it didn't matter i mean who we're gonna sleep with
71-2_4528.59_1.436.wav_ASR	he was like my brother at that point
71-2_4530.79_1.74.wav_ASR	so kenny and i slap in one bad
71-2_4532.73_0.64.wav_ASR	it was a dog
71-2_4533.83_2.42.wav_ASR	and sandy and katty slap in the other one
71-2_4536.43_6.242.wav_ASR	and we put all our stuff up you know our bag packs and our um sleeping bags and our uh sleeping bags
71-2_4542.95_1.454.wav_ASR	then we all want to this part
71-2_4544.65_2.441.wav_ASR	and everybody's really dressed at this party
71-2_4547.69_2.18.wav_ASR	you were genes
71-2_4558.543_1.81.wav_ASR	everybody's all made up
71-2_4560.543_2.446.wav_ASR	there we are looking like we look
71-2_4563.963_5.82.wav_ASR	and uh the whole thing at the party became the focus of
71-2_4569.795_5.22.wav_ASR	so this guy is sleeping with all three of you in the hotel
71-2_4575.455_8.129.wav_ASR	oh that's all we talked about all night um was just that cavin had three different women that he was having sex with
71-2_4583.835_2.445.wav_ASR	so
71-2_4586.535_3.105.wav_ASR	which i could be an American man and travel with three
71-2_4589.64_1.073.wav_ASR	and you know
71-2_4591.62_1.186.wav_ASR	obviously
71-2_4593.08_2.472.wav_ASR	oh impressive by the whole thing
71-2_4595.68_0.879.wav_ASR	we um
71-2_4597.78_4.75.wav_ASR	what's interesting is on the way back um we stopped again in the the the battery
71-2_4602.76_3.63.wav_ASR	capable came out of the bath room the men's bathroom and so on
71-2_4607.06_1.72.wav_ASR	it has got the trends in and out
71-2_4609.0_0.74.wav_ASR	or
71-2_4609.96_0.5.wav_ASR	happy
71-2_4610.475_1.125.wav_ASR	so
71-2_4611.66_1.84.wav_ASR	oh i was at the um euro no
71-2_4614.02_1.751.wav_ASR	and i was standing there
71-2_4615.94_0.733.wav_ASR	and i was p. e.
71-2_4617.72_1.59.wav_ASR	and all this man came
71-2_4619.54_4.24.wav_ASR	yeah he could have gone to the other side of the room
71-2_4624.08_1.411.wav_ASR	came and stuff right next to them
71-2_4626.74_0.6.wav_ASR	yeah he said
71-2_4627.405_1.298.wav_ASR	and i don't know what that mean
71-2_4628.703_0.68.wav_ASR	it's a side view
71-2_4630.703_0.392.wav_ASR	oh my
71-2_4631.095_1.208.wav_ASR	it's a television you know
71-2_4632.523_0.44.wav_ASR	he said
71-2_4633.223_4.051.wav_ASR	he had the biggest pines i'd ever seen
71-2_4637.563_0.429.wav_ASR	oh
71-2_4638.163_1.275.wav_ASR	so some of that
71-2_4640.283_2.322.wav_ASR	thinking about that a year later it kind of made sense
71-2_4642.723_0.997.wav_ASR	oh the time
71-2_4643.84_0.556.wav_ASR	oh no
71-2_4644.543_1.18.wav_ASR	be this is what a tool
71-2_4645.732_10.149.wav_ASR	we just thought a teletown was so strange that somebody would be able to sleep in a uh a fully loaded one or not be able to sleep when he's exhausted
71-2_4656.872_1.771.wav_ASR	we could not speak if i were in that room
71-2_4658.952_2.411.wav_ASR	it just couldn't imagine all those women around them
71-2_4661.432_1.043.wav_ASR	we're sharing a battery
71-2_4663.072_0.5.wav_ASR	oh my
71-2_4663.885_1.9.wav_ASR	oh yeah
71-2_4665.989_3.342.wav_ASR	that's better than the one where i had to say
71-2_4669.685_0.92.wav_ASR	you have any
71-2_4670.828_2.306.wav_ASR	and um which is what i told you last week
71-2_4673.345_2.38.wav_ASR	oh i don't have a whole lot of storage
71-2_4676.085_0.796.wav_ASR	yeah
71-2_4677.505_0.76.wav_ASR	but
71-2_4683.67_0.73.wav_ASR	okay
71-2_4684.79_1.88.wav_ASR	we've already talked about my
71-2_4687.29_1.19.wav_ASR	so come up with a different one
71-2_4688.98_22.04.wav_ASR	um i used to have this thing that i would do to family members and friends uh which involved them in research um on their laptops their browsers and uh in particular
71-2_4711.28_5.98.wav_ASR	and what i would do is i would usually go quite
71-2_4718.12_0.593.wav_ASR	but get up
71-2_4718.88_1.542.wav_ASR	you would excuse myself
71-2_4720.7_0.485.wav_ASR	yeah
71-2_4721.32_1.92.wav_ASR	and i would talk to the uh architects
71-2_4723.38_1.18.wav_ASR	we would say something like
71-2_4724.78_0.758.wav_ASR	it's my job
71-2_4725.64_1.14.wav_ASR	it's its birthday today
71-2_4727.48_2.1.wav_ASR	he doesn't like any attachment
71-2_4729.698_4.925.wav_ASR	and so is there any point in time in which you could bring us uh a cake
71-2_4734.623_3.695.wav_ASR	and then we could really experiment him by singing really loudly
71-2_4738.31_3.62.wav_ASR	usually um the wireless tap they're always
71-2_4742.318_0.971.wav_ASR	oh we don't have to do that
71-2_4743.298_0.762.wav_ASR	that would be fine
71-2_4744.738_1.792.wav_ASR	so i just think about doing that
71-2_4746.63_5.9.wav_ASR	and and very often i would bring my own candles um b the kind that don't blow out
71-2_4752.99_5.848.wav_ASR	um the light um 'cause then it can really really emphasize people
71-2_4758.97_1.497.wav_ASR	yeah
71-2_4761.43_2.915.wav_ASR	oh uh it was my company's budget
71-2_4764.86_4.14.wav_ASR	and his relationship with his girlfriend has just end
71-2_4769.48_3.76.wav_ASR	it's always kind of quiet and and shy
71-2_4774.06_7.648.wav_ASR	so i decided that what we should really do is we should um call a lot of attention to him because
71-2_4782.483_4.66.wav_ASR	so uh there were about fifteen of us there in the family
71-2_4787.403_2.28.wav_ASR	um we weren't all sitting in the same
71-2_4790.743_1.267.wav_ASR	we weren't in the same boat
71-2_4792.783_6.78.wav_ASR	but i decided that would actually add to the end if um we had people singing from a distance around him
71-2_4800.425_7.26.wav_ASR	oh i i took my news and a newspaper with me uh to talk to the um wireless stat
71-2_4808.085_1.875.wav_ASR	and matthew was then six
71-2_4810.545_1.415.wav_ASR	and evan was eight
71-2_4812.62_1.14.wav_ASR	so they came with me
71-2_4813.825_0.36.wav_ASR	and
71-2_4814.405_1.486.wav_ASR	that's what we're gonna do
71-2_4815.905_1.236.wav_ASR	oh
71-2_4817.285_1.99.wav_ASR	we're going to surprise him on his birthday
71-2_4819.275_11.285.wav_ASR	so w what we have to do is is we have to make sure that everybody understands that they're gonna have to start to sing at some point and that they shouldn't know in advance
71-2_4831.135_4.64.wav_ASR	so d. n. o. is over talking to i don't know some other related
71-2_4836.42_3.78.wav_ASR	and matthew and evan and i or running around talking to everyone
71-2_4840.48_2.887.wav_ASR	okay now you have to sing very loud
71-2_4843.64_1.672.wav_ASR	you got a very very quiet
71-2_4845.6_1.096.wav_ASR	yeah
71-2_4847.02_9.14.wav_ASR	so he here's maddy talking to the um i it was his brother mm probably my other cousin
71-2_4856.255_2.8.wav_ASR	remember to send very very low
71-2_4859.535_1.02.wav_ASR	they don't
71-2_4861.135_1.305.wav_ASR	injoying this whole process
71-2_4864.14_0.78.wav_ASR	yeah
71-2_4865.495_0.665.wav_ASR	can be so
71-2_4866.355_0.48.wav_ASR	it's right
71-2_4867.715_1.611.wav_ASR	what are they going to do
71-2_4869.355_1.262.wav_ASR	you knew something was coming
71-2_4871.42_5.18.wav_ASR	but he didn't know about the type of uh production that we had put in
71-2_4876.94_5.5.wav_ASR	didn't know about the special handles that wouldn't burn uh wouldn't blow out
71-2_4882.7_11.06.wav_ASR	you didn't know that we were gonna get the um the entire waste wasting staff uh people who were waiting on the tables to bring it
71-2_4894.34_6.12.wav_ASR	and he didn't know that everybody in my family would really enjoy the entire process
71-2_4900.46_6.912.wav_ASR	and you know we get very kind of um loud and uh when we do things like this
71-2_4907.74_2.645.wav_ASR	yeah of course they came from behind
71-2_4910.64_5.579.wav_ASR	the i only thought one um wood survey was going to bring the k.
71-2_4917.02_1.8.wav_ASR	instead we had like six or so
71-2_4919.0_1.337.wav_ASR	everybody decide to come along
71-2_4920.337_2.048.wav_ASR	oh my god
71-2_4922.677_1.435.wav_ASR	it came from a high
71-2_4924.697_6.411.wav_ASR	he he could tell that it was coming because everybody on the other side or ringing and looking at him
71-2_4931.777_2.24.wav_ASR	and matthew and evan or just laugh
71-2_4934.457_1.743.wav_ASR	well
71-2_4936.937_0.93.wav_ASR	it's time to
71-2_4938.097_0.862.wav_ASR	it's time to think
71-2_4938.959_2.806.wav_ASR	oh and you got done got done
71-2_4941.979_0.74.wav_ASR	sign
71-2_4943.099_1.014.wav_ASR	you blow it out
71-2_4944.419_1.009.wav_ASR	came back again
71-2_4945.559_0.321.wav_ASR	like this
71-2_4946.139_1.029.wav_ASR	you must be getting old
71-2_4947.999_3.841.wav_ASR	are you at least have the ability to blow out the candle
71-2_4951.84_1.08.wav_ASR	it's can you
71-2_4953.279_0.841.wav_ASR	yeah
71-2_4955.019_0.65.wav_ASR	um
71-2_4955.879_0.703.wav_ASR	it's going
71-2_4956.739_1.861.wav_ASR	yeah it's looking at me
71-2_4958.6_2.165.wav_ASR	and he got down and said
71-2_4961.02_4.396.wav_ASR	you know uh i gotta remember this
71-2_4965.96_1.081.wav_ASR	oh you gotta remember that
71-2_4967.18_0.36.wav_ASR	so i said
71-2_4967.76_1.097.wav_ASR	was it a surprise
71-2_4968.88_0.538.wav_ASR	it's a side view
71-2_4969.54_2.689.wav_ASR	it was not a surprise when i heard matthew say
71-2_4972.7_2.78.wav_ASR	remember to sing very very loud
71-2_4976.56_11.193.wav_ASR	so uh i will say that i i know i think i had i think i gave her um weighters i think i gave her like twenty dollars or something what she had done because she carried it off so well
71-2_4988.7_0.52.wav_ASR	it's
71-2_4989.46_1.132.wav_ASR	it was so much fun
71-2_4990.7_0.32.wav_ASR	is it
71-2_4991.1_1.881.wav_ASR	it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's
71-2_4992.981_3.44.wav_ASR	and and d. just looked at it
71-2_4998.102_3.085.wav_ASR	oh alright yeah anyway that was fine
71-2_5001.681_0.427.wav_ASR	but
71-2_5016.87_9.94.wav_ASR	um back in the days when i would make kinetebetter and gilly spongy because of of course i can't any more for all sorts of reasons
71-2_5026.95_5.193.wav_ASR	upper part of it and too much sugar and all the rest of it
71-2_5032.23_5.632.wav_ASR	but back in the days when i would have done this oh what i would have done is that i would have started out with the br
71-2_5038.61_13.295.wav_ASR	and i would have tossed it because um the test tester of toast works better for me than it does um with on and off buttons
71-2_5052.65_3.64.wav_ASR	um so i would begin by putting it in the poster
71-2_5056.23_6.16.wav_ASR	and while it's storing up i would hold out the pen button and the gel
71-2_5063.89_6.546.wav_ASR	um when the bread comes out of the toaster i would begin with the pineapple
71-2_5070.71_0.899.wav_ASR	goes on the bottom
71-2_5071.89_4.232.wav_ASR	but i would do with a night is i would pull out some pineapple
71-2_5076.47_2.8.wav_ASR	we would spend it evenly on the bread
71-2_5079.93_2.64.wav_ASR	then i would take the other piece of toe
71-2_5083.17_7.54.wav_ASR	and i would take a sponge and um sponge out some gel
71-2_5091.25_1.174.wav_ASR	rid of
71-2_5093.29_1.54.wav_ASR	and then put the two of them together
71-2_5095.33_3.74.wav_ASR	and probably slice it before a
71-2_5100.37_1.46.wav_ASR	uh i don't need things like that
71-2_5102.25_1.58.wav_ASR	if i did that's how i would do it
71-2_5111.35_0.5.wav_ASR	okay
71-2_5112.173_4.003.wav_ASR	well i think we talked about this last week
71-2_5116.353_4.662.wav_ASR	and i'm not done my laundry since last week which means i really need to do it at this point
71-2_5122.17_24.64.wav_ASR	um when i do longer um what i'm able to do is not separate them uh from colour and white uh because i've got to the point that i only buy them um from colourful and white uh which is also much better for the environment
71-2_5147.64_14.38.wav_ASR	so all of my solved all of my data is already put aside um because as close the small tasks they end up in my
71-2_5163.84_1.68.wav_ASR	so when it's time to do
71-2_5205.68_2.96.wav_ASR	uh my plan is probably tomorrow after
71-2_5208.96_5.54.wav_ASR	have a break between two different opinions that will allow me to do that
71-2_5214.8_4.46.wav_ASR	what i'm going to do is i'll pull into the londer which is on the east wall
71-2_5221.0_3.28.wav_ASR	oh i think it's about twenty one hundred
71-2_5224.612_5.38.wav_ASR	i will walk into a a medium size washing machine
71-2_5230.452_2.529.wav_ASR	and i will put all of my laundry in
71-2_5233.212_2.606.wav_ASR	we will not separate it by colour or white
71-2_5236.572_4.435.wav_ASR	we will then add the sub oh sorry the sub at the top of it
71-2_5241.89_6.96.wav_ASR	then i will put in enough colours to be able to uh begin the circle
71-2_5249.67_3.44.wav_ASR	and i will wash on my clothes on
71-2_5253.83_7.3.wav_ASR	um after the quarters are in i push the cold water bowl
71-2_5261.412_5.86.wav_ASR	and then i take note of the fact that it will take twenty five minutes for it to walk
71-2_5300.51_7.94.wav_ASR	um because it's tools and um swear words and things and spreadsheets that will take longer to to draw
71-2_5309.73_7.36.wav_ASR	then i threw it all back in the and take it home and then sometimes unsold it or put it away
71-2_5317.17_8.72.wav_ASR	it sometimes i just take right out of the clean and put it on my my uh my body or my bed or whatever i need it
71-2_5335.726_1.6.wav_ASR	okay
71-2_5338.086_0.904.wav_ASR	well i've never done that
71-2_5339.206_1.26.wav_ASR	uh i have tried
71-2_5341.05_1.916.wav_ASR	we'll make very clear that i have tried
71-2_5343.826_8.14.wav_ASR	and have not ever i have not succeeded in doing so um for different reasons
71-2_5352.99_2.016.wav_ASR	um if i wanted to do it correct
71-2_5355.43_3.92.wav_ASR	um and this is what it says on the side
71-2_5360.33_1.64.wav_ASR	which has never worked for me
71-2_5362.41_2.88.wav_ASR	uh this is essentially the way that we would do
71-2_5365.51_1.04.wav_ASR	it would get
71-2_5368.81_1.36.wav_ASR	or i would get
71-2_5370.83_2.38.wav_ASR	we would go to a plant
71-2_5374.88_3.677.wav_ASR	and there is one that's about a mile and a half from where i live
71-2_5378.64_3.28.wav_ASR	and you buy a special type of
71-2_5384.1_1.523.wav_ASR	or it it comes in a bad
71-2_5385.8_1.105.wav_ASR	but i think it's it's
71-2_5387.32_6.933.wav_ASR	why i know is that it's it's it's full enough that you should be able to grow things on it
71-2_5394.253_3.88.wav_ASR	and i would put this into a pot
71-2_5398.493_12.547.wav_ASR	and i would make sure that there was uh a whole in it for legacy so that if you put the water in the water it's uh accessible water will be able to drain out into a tray
71-2_5412.06_6.94.wav_ASR	um put the part near uh window so that there's enough s
71-2_5420.54_3.72.wav_ASR	and what i would do is make sure that the
71-2_5424.56_4.012.wav_ASR	um first i would read the directions on the c. package which i've done before
71-2_5429.36_2.358.wav_ASR	ch is you have to go down about two inches
71-2_5431.718_2.05.wav_ASR	so you take a seed
71-2_5434.438_1.243.wav_ASR	oh you place it
71-2_5436.118_0.689.wav_ASR	you cover
71-2_5437.218_1.782.wav_ASR	you water it
71-2_5439.278_1.558.wav_ASR	then you leave it alone
71-2_5441.258_2.82.wav_ASR	supposedly newer takes its core
71-2_5444.438_5.88.wav_ASR	um in my particular situation one time i didn't have enough sun
71-2_5451.69_10.26.wav_ASR	um another time i simply overwatered it to the point that the the soil was so saturated that the seed
71-2_5463.05_8.069.wav_ASR	and i think the other time it was too cold in my apartment to be able to spray in the way that it was supposed to
71-2_5471.119_2.542.wav_ASR	but i've seen other people do it
71-2_5473.819_1.78.wav_ASR	you know the process exists
71-2_5475.839_4.031.wav_ASR	had just been unable to actually do it in a way that makes it actually work
71-2_5480.75_10.703.wav_ASR	yeah i'm still in the potential status potential stay of stage of understanding of what you're supposed to be able to do
71-2_5491.453_11.589.wav_ASR	but i haven't yet figured out how to keep the sky bright enough so that it it can uh it can't write without me overwriting it to the point that i
71-2_5503.85_5.443.wav_ASR	so i think there's a balance i haven't yet agreed to be able to do it
84-1_17.07_2.48.wav_ASR	and i would have to say one of my favourite tricks
84-1_19.816_4.091.wav_ASR	you have my wife and i have two sons that are older now
84-1_24.096_5.94.wav_ASR	and for a number of years we went skiing in u. t. in paris
84-1_31.276_2.24.wav_ASR	uh i really enjoyed the output
84-1_33.838_6.2.wav_ASR	so my question was probably about three years old and my older was probably
84-1_40.738_1.181.wav_ASR	it's probably a little bit
84-1_42.198_2.46.wav_ASR	be like five and
84-1_45.878_4.42.wav_ASR	well it's just so much fun to get out there and and uh
84-1_50.529_3.88.wav_ASR	uh i i could see already but my but my two kids
84-1_55.149_1.45.wav_ASR	my wife speed a little bit
84-1_56.809_3.24.wav_ASR	my two kids became pretty good singers
84-1_60.329_3.354.wav_ASR	um pretty sure that a lot of them was
84-1_63.693_8.407.wav_ASR	we had a guide when we were in um in in um in and in um
84-1_72.333_1.915.wav_ASR	just lost the name of the place
84-1_74.633_3.58.wav_ASR	and um when we were in euro
84-1_78.653_2.88.wav_ASR	and we would guide with him for a number of years and
84-1_81.538_1.66.wav_ASR	he did a really good job
84-1_83.198_9.633.wav_ASR	but i hope that we'll give you a little bit of spongy kids and number two how much i numbered my kids and number two how much i enjoyed skiing with them while when i could
84-1_100.218_1.397.wav_ASR	it it was very nice
84-1_127.149_12.52.wav_ASR	well i just um i just got accepted to be part of the bar again in february in pen pal
84-1_141.089_3.08.wav_ASR	uh would say my my skills
84-1_144.711_5.549.wav_ASR	i i i don't i think my skills are pretty good
84-1_150.311_2.822.wav_ASR	they're never gonna be great as they once were
84-1_153.811_8.199.wav_ASR	so i would say on a scale of one to ten right now i would say i'm probably a s
84-1_162.21_3.04.wav_ASR	so i feel like i made a lot of progress
84-1_165.81_5.761.wav_ASR	but i know that there's more progress i need to make especially w with big words
84-1_172.07_1.91.wav_ASR	big words can be difficult
84-1_174.17_3.53.wav_ASR	oh i do see a speech responder
84-1_177.77_3.733.wav_ASR	it's been extremely extremely helpful
84-1_181.503_0.887.wav_ASR	like a
84-1_182.39_6.734.wav_ASR	and i have a i also have something that's um some some work out with me
84-1_189.203_1.429.wav_ASR	the two of them are just great
84-1_196.9_1.27.wav_ASR	oh i remember that pretty well
84-1_207.12_2.95.wav_ASR	well my wife was a way for the
84-1_210.39_2.78.wav_ASR	we had a house in australia
84-1_214.15_3.64.wav_ASR	and i remember that website because i had to work
84-1_217.968_4.82.wav_ASR	and i thought the biggest thing we c i could do for the week end was to stay home
84-1_223.738_8.03.wav_ASR	so i think she probably went down there or maybe wednesday or thursday
84-1_232.508_2.66.wav_ASR	and i came home from work on friday
84-1_236.128_0.848.wav_ASR	uh-huh
84-1_236.976_0.998.wav_ASR	i did some work
84-1_238.176_2.0.wav_ASR	got up the next morning
84-1_240.536_5.24.wav_ASR	but that was the thirty thirties of
84-1_247.676_1.721.wav_ASR	and i felt pretty good
84-1_249.716_1.188.wav_ASR	but about my day
84-1_251.576_2.08.wav_ASR	we went out for a basic ride
84-1_254.296_1.0.wav_ASR	and i came home
84-1_255.22_20.6.wav_ASR	and that's the right that um and that no it was i think like a weak or too a weak maybe after four it was i think like a weak or too a weak
84-1_276.504_5.66.wav_ASR	and so on Saturday night i went to bed a little bit early
84-1_282.524_4.46.wav_ASR	but um well i i thought they might be some biology
84-1_287.724_3.66.wav_ASR	and i also thought it would be helpful in the mornings
84-1_291.464_1.784.wav_ASR	so i could clean up a little bit
84-1_293.7_2.69.wav_ASR	so we live in a fairly nice area
84-1_297.14_2.43.wav_ASR	and i went to bed around ten thirty
84-1_300.6_5.7.wav_ASR	and that night Saturday night there was a lot of violence in in certain city
84-1_307.16_3.84.wav_ASR	and i remember that that of a building was burned
84-1_315.929_2.242.wav_ASR	and so i got a
84-1_318.529_2.98.wav_ASR	uh i'd give it a fairly secure place
84-1_322.129_4.884.wav_ASR	and um the next morning i got up really early and went outside
84-1_327.229_1.08.wav_ASR	it was a total mess
84-1_329.189_1.324.wav_ASR	so i started cleaning up
84-1_331.129_3.4.wav_ASR	and sometimes the day i felt a little bit
84-1_334.969_1.819.wav_ASR	so i went back home
84-1_337.0_1.019.wav_ASR	for a little
84-1_338.309_1.26.wav_ASR	we got a paper
84-1_340.069_2.184.wav_ASR	and then i thought pretty good for the rest of the day
84-1_342.769_10.717.wav_ASR	it's some time on that saturday night before maddy thirty first and o. g. i mean s and june first i had my scroll
84-1_354.11_3.04.wav_ASR	and in the morning my wife could not get a hold of me
84-1_357.75_1.397.wav_ASR	so we have a door man here
84-1_359.39_0.831.wav_ASR	you went up
84-1_360.85_1.3.wav_ASR	and i was on the floor
84-1_362.37_2.0.wav_ASR	and so he call an animal
84-1_364.67_4.58.wav_ASR	um i um i my wife was in um offensive mirror
84-1_369.477_7.22.wav_ASR	so um she was told that i had better that i should that
84-1_377.397_1.08.wav_ASR	yeah but
84-1_378.897_3.68.wav_ASR	um that my wife should come home
84-1_382.428_8.24.wav_ASR	and i have two songs one who's in um one who's in
84-1_391.348_6.86.wav_ASR	they were told it was probably a good idea for them to come home because i wasn't sure what was gonna happen
84-1_398.267_6.5.wav_ASR	and so i remembered distinctly that i was brought into the emergency room
84-1_405.227_2.72.wav_ASR	and apparently i d i could not say a lot more
84-1_407.987_2.86.wav_ASR	my my voice was very garbled
84-1_411.47_14.3.wav_ASR	um but the end by the end of the speaker my my wife told me later that um she thought i was gonna s he wasn't sure what kind of shape i'd be in
84-1_425.77_14.463.wav_ASR	but by the end of the survey which was um i had a broad view um i was able to build
84-1_440.31_3.579.wav_ASR	they didn't know how much exactly i'll be able to do
84-1_444.38_6.0.wav_ASR	so i um i spent about six eight weeks in the in um reha
84-1_451.21_2.29.wav_ASR	and i came out not sure what i could
84-1_453.84_4.18.wav_ASR	so today i i feel pretty good about my voice
84-1_458.6_2.9.wav_ASR	as i said i still feel like there's more i can do
84-1_462.06_4.25.wav_ASR	so as i said i think i'm about seventy percent right now
84-1_478.63_9.28.wav_ASR	well i was in the house i was in reham for eight weeks about a place that's about maybe eight blocks from here
84-1_488.29_1.76.wav_ASR	and it was a time when it was cobra
84-1_490.47_3.04.wav_ASR	so it wasn't really easy for me to see people
84-1_494.13_3.84.wav_ASR	but one of the one of the people where we live
84-1_498.084_2.28.wav_ASR	because i live in a high storage building
84-1_501.2_9.29.wav_ASR	one of the persons was like maybe the second or third commandet which is where i went to for my reha
84-1_511.17_8.41.wav_ASR	and um this person who's name is kate was allowed to give two people in to see me
84-1_520.09_3.903.wav_ASR	oh i got to see well my two sisters came in
84-1_524.19_2.789.wav_ASR	and my my sister came in
84-1_527.21_2.02.wav_ASR	and then my wife came in
84-1_529.33_4.5.wav_ASR	so i had a very good uh i had very good teamwork
84-1_534.47_8.45.wav_ASR	and so each day i would have um i would have um i would have um o. t. p. and speech
84-1_543.73_2.66.wav_ASR	that was every day except for Saturdays and Sundays
84-1_554.07_3.15.wav_ASR	well what can that there's nothing i can do about
84-1_558.98_2.94.wav_ASR	so i i mean i understood i had to deal with that
84-1_562.65_2.916.wav_ASR	yeah i always feel with it but i tried to
84-1_590.17_3.99.wav_ASR	well i have to tell you i've had a pretty good life until my death
84-1_595.73_3.421.wav_ASR	we would say that one of the best things that i was
84-1_599.151_7.46.wav_ASR	um i was in a program at a school called wednesday which is in middle town
84-1_607.212_12.7.wav_ASR	when i was there part of this programme i was in this concert it's made it so that i had to spend a semester uh
84-1_620.93_9.96.wav_ASR	and during starting in like seventeen great through high school and then into college i spoke fr rant french pretty well
84-1_631.61_7.66.wav_ASR	um because i had a teacher in in wong kong who was at the time going out with one of the cobra
84-1_639.596_3.36.wav_ASR	and so um she was french
84-1_643.098_1.783.wav_ASR	and she used to talk about that a lot
84-1_645.456_2.323.wav_ASR	uh so i took a class from her
84-1_648.376_1.811.wav_ASR	and somehow i did pretty well
84-1_650.376_6.36.wav_ASR	so when i when i w then i was in the program at um at west
84-1_657.064_3.6.wav_ASR	and i would say one of the Happiest areas for me was graphical
84-1_661.59_8.094.wav_ASR	but i i went up doing pretty well at the school and um even though i had got in on a wait list
84-1_670.684_1.52.wav_ASR	um it was really exciting
84-1_672.25_9.12.wav_ASR	uh i d i d i knew a bunch of people in my class but i was really close with the class of eighty
84-1_681.67_2.875.wav_ASR	and um it was just a fun time for me
84-1_684.545_1.765.wav_ASR	uh i was present at my father's party
84-1_687.01_6.06.wav_ASR	and i i met someone who became one of my closest friends
84-1_693.27_2.1.wav_ASR	he was the prototype
84-1_695.55_2.306.wav_ASR	so i it was really nice
84-1_698.38_8.68.wav_ASR	uh i s pened a after i graduated from high school i spent some of my rummies with him and some of my room mates
84-1_707.68_2.16.wav_ASR	he he was someone who was remote
84-1_710.58_2.476.wav_ASR	he went to harry's school
84-1_713.273_5.48.wav_ASR	and at the end of his frustration he went down he went down
84-1_719.733_2.72.wav_ASR	and he went down to the um book store
84-1_722.973_3.56.wav_ASR	and he bought all books about r televisions
84-1_726.863_7.22.wav_ASR	so he went back to went back to s to cambridge and he changed
84-1_734.443_1.76.wav_ASR	he was already in las vegas
84-1_736.563_2.08.wav_ASR	you'd been under guarded protection
84-1_739.263_4.24.wav_ASR	and he and he um after his first year of going the remote he said
84-1_743.663_0.992.wav_ASR	it wasn't for me
84-1_744.8_5.82.wav_ASR	and he went to at a program he went to a program in a television
84-1_756.57_3.48.wav_ASR	yeah i had a i was really it was a good place from
84-1_764.754_4.32.wav_ASR	but i haven't been visiting since my draw
84-1_769.655_5.279.wav_ASR	but i used to be you know i used to be fairly involved
84-1_775.834_6.1.wav_ASR	and my youngest my youngest son went there after spending a euro and scroll
84-1_782.807_7.94.wav_ASR	and he really really did a a a he was he did really well at the school
84-1_790.907_3.04.wav_ASR	so i was very excited for him
84-1_828.61_2.67.wav_ASR	well i have to know these pictures quite well
84-1_832.07_3.18.wav_ASR	um it's a story about a kid playing
84-1_836.05_3.3.wav_ASR	and he hit the b he struck the ball
84-1_839.99_3.52.wav_ASR	and went through the window of a nearby house
84-1_843.796_24.848.wav_ASR	and and it was taken by one of the young or maybe um it was taken by one of the young or maybe um uh just a a regular part of the house
84-1_868.644_20.254.wav_ASR	and then he looked out the window to see if he could figure out who may have hid his hide the socket ball so that it landed on his on his um no on his laptop on his lapel i think
84-1_907.89_1.94.wav_ASR	oh
84-1_909.988_8.342.wav_ASR	it's it's about a young boy who when he went to school he was deciding whether or not to take an umbrella
84-1_918.59_2.6.wav_ASR	he decided not to take the elephant
84-1_921.69_2.48.wav_ASR	and it turned out that it started running
84-1_924.87_1.88.wav_ASR	so he went back home
84-1_926.94_1.818.wav_ASR	and he was so
84-1_929.34_2.127.wav_ASR	but apparently he changed his clothes
84-1_932.02_5.76.wav_ASR	and he went back outside with a umbrella so that he could get to school
84-1_938.24_6.041.wav_ASR	um i assume we went to school on time but i really don't know whether that's part of the study or not
84-1_957.58_7.15.wav_ASR	so this is a little girl maybe under ten who had a cat who was stuck in the tree
84-1_965.45_7.58.wav_ASR	so apparently the the dead got off his um got a later
84-1_973.283_3.967.wav_ASR	guillermo was um guillermo
84-1_977.59_1.904.wav_ASR	he stopped and looked at the cat
84-1_979.94_19.956.wav_ASR	so the cat went up to get the get the the the the the cat went up to get the cat
84-1_999.896_13.754.wav_ASR	and i guess the um the um the uh lady got kicked away so that the s the bunch was stuck up there with the um cat
84-1_1014.556_2.6.wav_ASR	and the the dog started barking
84-1_1017.78_2.68.wav_ASR	and eventually the fire department came
84-1_1021.24_0.94.wav_ASR	they were
84-1_1022.44_0.5.wav_ASR	pros
84-1_1023.32_0.654.wav_ASR	don't know
84-1_1024.06_3.563.wav_ASR	but think they were ready to get the cat and get the man down
84-1_1188.54_7.06.wav_ASR	so this is the story about a a young man named sinder
84-1_1196.189_19.982.wav_ASR	and she was working at a place where there was a a middle age lady and two people who had grown up with her and it was interesting in trying to get some one to marry them
84-1_1216.59_15.38.wav_ASR	so it turned out that the that the that there was a young print who was interested who was his father
84-1_1232.85_29.52.wav_ASR	and the young print's decided that they should get together and have a ball so that maybe the uh people from the communication could find out if any but if the produce in the in having a relationship with the programme
84-1_1263.48_2.52.wav_ASR	but don't remember the name of the presenter
84-1_1266.09_4.89.wav_ASR	but so they sent around an invitation to all the people in the community
84-1_1272.04_9.98.wav_ASR	and the two younger ladies who lived with her who lived with her who lived with her
84-1_1284.38_8.84.wav_ASR	her older brother decided that they would go to the ball and start getting dressed to go to the ball
84-1_1293.98_17.52.wav_ASR	but sinderella who was like a careaker on the property and was stuck doing things like walking the floor and cleaning the floor and stuff like that she found out about their being this um
84-1_1312.413_4.54.wav_ASR	and she wanted to know if there was some way she could add
84-1_1317.593_1.78.wav_ASR	so she
84-1_1320.333_2.28.wav_ASR	don't remember exactly how it happened
84-1_1323.133_6.02.wav_ASR	she was able to get into touch with somebody i think they call the very
84-1_1330.065_3.52.wav_ASR	and um she talked to the very god
84-1_1334.45_20.985.wav_ASR	and so well the two people from the from the from the house were going with her her her her lady
84-1_1355.435_4.2.wav_ASR	so she got dressed up in in fancy clothes
84-1_1360.415_5.337.wav_ASR	and she was told by theairy godmother that she could go to the ball
84-1_1365.795_1.72.wav_ASR	but she had only one record
84-1_1368.295_2.94.wav_ASR	and that is that she'd be bad by a mid night
84-1_1371.407_11.811.wav_ASR	so she went to the ball and felt in love with the price and was having a good time with the price
84-1_1383.218_12.28.wav_ASR	but when the cl clock's dead right so mid night um sinclair and new that she had to get out of there
84-1_1396.098_5.08.wav_ASR	so she raised for the door and down the steps and into the chambers
84-1_1401.35_2.26.wav_ASR	but soon the carrier
84-1_1404.69_9.9.wav_ASR	and she was by herself with i think some young people who may have been like rabbits and other membranes of the of the communication
84-1_1415.23_19.09.wav_ASR	um so um so um she found out that the that the young price was looking for
84-1_1434.84_11.51.wav_ASR	and sh he sent out a a i guess some sort of play or something that if the person was around she should please contact him
84-1_1446.76_12.16.wav_ASR	and when that didn't happen then a young man went around the village to see if by chance anybody knew any thing about this young
84-1_1459.92_3.1.wav_ASR	and when she went to the house that had the two
84-1_1463.595_2.1.wav_ASR	you guess you might by now call it s
84-1_1468.04_9.89.wav_ASR	um she i think somehow got a hold of sinderella who may be like watching clothes in the bathroom or something
84-1_1478.88_7.897.wav_ASR	and when she was brought up there's the one shoe that had been left behind
84-1_1486.777_13.623.wav_ASR	and it fit her so that it she knew that the that the young print was going to continue to like this young lad
84-1_1501.077_2.06.wav_ASR	and so i guess they got back together
84-1_1503.537_1.94.wav_ASR	obviously they got married
84-1_1550.75_3.76.wav_ASR	never really had a lot of experiences with clock
84-1_1555.47_3.2.wav_ASR	it was pretty much always on time
84-1_1559.37_10.68.wav_ASR	and when i was growing up particularly when i was in high school there for some reason was no real time limit on what time i had to get home
84-1_1570.61_8.74.wav_ASR	so um i was you know i went to a lot of parties on friday night and Saturday night and could come home when i wanted
84-1_1579.38_20.6.wav_ASR	but i think it was in large part 'cause my two solar power parents decided that you know he that the two of them really had to teach me how to be um how to be able to know when i was out too late
84-1_1600.084_3.495.wav_ASR	so i mean there were a few times when i was out too late
84-1_1604.124_2.309.wav_ASR	but nothing really ever happened to me
84-1_1606.924_3.866.wav_ASR	and then when i went to college i would come home during the summer
84-1_1611.804_6.56.wav_ASR	and i remember that um i was involved with the couple younger girls
84-1_1618.528_4.623.wav_ASR	but i would go out with them but i could get home whenever i wanted to
84-1_1623.52_6.58.wav_ASR	and i remember one sumber i had a job that required me to be to work at six o'clock in the morning
84-1_1630.928_3.42.wav_ASR	so sometimes during the summer i would stay out all night and then go to work
84-1_1645.61_7.485.wav_ASR	well so i worked a lot pretty much when i had i would i turned out to be
84-1_1653.47_2.186.wav_ASR	think i might have told you this
84-1_1655.73_0.463.wav_ASR	yeah sure
84-1_1656.193_3.42.wav_ASR	but i worked for a french company
84-1_1660.878_8.049.wav_ASR	and um i when i had my stroke i started thinking about things i could do
84-1_1668.927_8.2.wav_ASR	cause it's really between and between um a lot of time i spent particularly with my children
84-1_1678.067_2.92.wav_ASR	they were in a town in germany called print
84-1_1681.727_2.08.wav_ASR	and they both played a lot of hockey
84-1_1684.367_2.89.wav_ASR	um so i never really had a lot of time
84-1_1687.246_2.783.wav_ASR	but one thing i've decided that i'm going to do
84-1_1690.506_4.76.wav_ASR	with in the past within the next year we're gonna be moving a little further south
84-1_1695.886_3.08.wav_ASR	and i really thought that one thing i could do was bird
84-1_1699.586_2.933.wav_ASR	because i always had an interest in that
84-1_1702.606_1.984.wav_ASR	but never really focused on that
84-1_1705.086_1.62.wav_ASR	and i really thought particularly
84-1_1706.856_2.9.wav_ASR	now i ride a three wheel bike
84-1_1709.936_4.506.wav_ASR	like can't write a um a two wheel bicycle like i used to do
84-1_1714.521_16.081.wav_ASR	so i'm really hoping that we move i can learn about birds and maybe become some one of an interests in in um in birds watching 'cause i think that would be a good thing for me to do
84-1_1736.76_2.52.wav_ASR	oh so did she live in bumbleton
84-1_1760.0_20.64.wav_ASR	well i i guess when i started the prototype when i started the prototype and the next one i was mainly responsible for the intended state
84-1_1780.938_3.5.wav_ASR	but they quickly figured out that i could speak
84-1_1785.098_1.94.wav_ASR	so the losers were in grade
84-1_1787.898_2.948.wav_ASR	and i was one of the fewolders outside of france
84-1_1791.078_1.06.wav_ASR	was in the unit
84-1_1793.658_4.48.wav_ASR	um they used to send me to various places
84-1_1798.398_5.96.wav_ASR	and i remember that i stayed in a real nice hotel in
84-1_1805.978_2.42.wav_ASR	and i also stayed in the nice hotel
84-1_1809.158_3.84.wav_ASR	oh i was in a a nice hotel when i went to china
84-1_1813.177_5.8.wav_ASR	and i also was in a nice hotel when i was in um
84-1_1822.457_6.54.wav_ASR	so i and uh during one of the times i was there and it was the fourth
84-1_1829.537_3.16.wav_ASR	so i remember that the staff brought me a little cake
84-1_1833.15_7.12.wav_ASR	um so i just i l i i i don't really need a big ol well though my wife likes some
84-1_1841.05_10.3.wav_ASR	um i always thought i was in places that i could be comfortable even when um even when
84-1_1851.626_2.28.wav_ASR	ye i i don't remember
84-1_1854.01_5.896.wav_ASR	oh it was in germany for uh for to be part of a case that was pending
84-1_1860.446_2.235.wav_ASR	and we stayed in a god awful hotel
84-1_1862.726_3.066.wav_ASR	even that turned out to be good
84-1_1865.941_11.7.wav_ASR	so it would g it was a good way from me to learn about i guess to learn about the way different how to tell me different
84-1_1878.421_3.38.wav_ASR	oh i was in a whole tail and a bad part of the
84-1_1882.0_1.381.wav_ASR	remember that pretty well
84-1_1897.088_7.408.wav_ASR	well when i was in college
84-1_1904.816_0.654.wav_ASR	and i thought you
84-1_1905.47_0.58.wav_ASR	the prototype
84-1_1906.59_6.9.wav_ASR	okay the key was there for about about thirty thirty five years
84-1_1913.91_2.92.wav_ASR	and in nineteen ninety nine
84-1_1917.85_5.54.wav_ASR	um but before that time she and a group of people
84-1_1923.607_16.1.wav_ASR	there was a one percent from the class of sixty five one percent from the class of eighty five which was me and a person from the class of seventy nine
84-1_1939.914_5.6.wav_ASR	the three of us the six five of us became very good friends
84-1_1945.874_9.776.wav_ASR	and every year 'cause w w w did not have any um did not really have any fruit
84-1_1955.75_8.1.wav_ASR	he was he had a child who died when when when he was i think maybe six or seven years old
84-1_1964.11_8.96.wav_ASR	and and so one thing he used to do once a quarter from kinetic he also used to go down to the noughts
84-1_1973.501_5.94.wav_ASR	and we stayed we we would we would we would i went from my grandmother
84-1_1979.861_3.68.wav_ASR	they went for every year their after for about twenty five euros
84-1_1983.921_5.12.wav_ASR	well i went to a place that's no longer in existence but it's called
84-1_1989.678_3.6.wav_ASR	and um it was a very nice
84-1_1994.718_3.712.wav_ASR	um and we just had a wonderful time every here
84-1_1998.43_14.51.wav_ASR	so i really think back on that a lot and remember just how much fun i had with these people and how much i still keep in contact with them
84-1_2012.94_5.74.wav_ASR	and so these these people are some very um well known peep
84-1_2019.2_6.8.wav_ASR	and um so i've already had one of the words has already died
84-1_2026.88_4.22.wav_ASR	uh he was the head of this thing called the the uh
84-1_2031.651_17.0.wav_ASR	it's a big it's a big um it's a big it's a big
84-1_2048.851_0.828.wav_ASR	you forgot the name
84-1_2049.811_1.4.wav_ASR	they have a huge trap
84-1_2051.568_3.28.wav_ASR	and so he's gonna retire and move back to the nursery
84-1_2055.648_10.086.wav_ASR	so i'm very excited that at the end um submitter i'm gonna be meeting with them and these people who go back to the class of sixty two
84-1_2066.128_2.086.wav_ASR	so i'm i'm looking forward to it
84-1_2068.397_8.98.wav_ASR	uh i some days i i sometimes i would be a little better i would be a little better than i am now
84-1_2077.677_3.26.wav_ASR	oh they all know i had um i had a straw
84-1_2081.677_3.36.wav_ASR	um i i'm really looking forward
84-1_2085.17_5.06.wav_ASR	most days some days i think that maybe i shouldn't go 'cause i'm not far enough
84-1_2090.73_1.56.wav_ASR	but it's it's um
84-1_2093.19_1.8.wav_ASR	kinda remember what we were talking about
84-1_2100.86_4.44.wav_ASR	so so we went to this very nice restaurant right
84-1_2105.464_2.296.wav_ASR	we didn't for about twenty or twenty five years
84-1_2108.22_5.907.wav_ASR	and it was a place for me and for the other people that were in the in the group
84-1_2114.08_11.39.wav_ASR	we used to do it every year 'cause it was near the time when one of our favourite people from the last six two had a bird's eye view
84-1_2132.16_4.04.wav_ASR	it was a french restaurant
84-1_2137.66_14.62.wav_ASR	um it if you go back to the nineties and eighties and it's a it's a fifty nine t. v. it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a
84-1_2152.28_7.02.wav_ASR	you know it's in a in a in a nice old um building that has three or four floors
84-1_2159.56_1.7.wav_ASR	um
84-1_2161.495_22.32.wav_ASR	and because we would go there and um three or four times throughout the year they knew he'd the staff really really well so that when we came in for the birthday party um it was it was just fancy
84-1_2184.085_1.14.wav_ASR	it was really nice
84-1_2189.53_1.988.wav_ASR	it's not there anymore yeah
84-1_2191.525_0.84.wav_ASR	it was so
84-1_2192.725_1.984.wav_ASR	there was a an orange and his wife
84-1_2195.385_3.86.wav_ASR	and i think they obviously you know
84-1_2199.985_8.94.wav_ASR	and they sold the recharger to a guy who was i think from either France or from germany
84-1_2210.365_2.624.wav_ASR	um he did not do a very good job
84-1_2212.939_7.3.wav_ASR	so it i would say after three or four years it um it it didn't exist anymore
84-1_2224.89_2.489.wav_ASR	now w we're so um we're going to
84-1_2228.519_2.26.wav_ASR	or the volume who it was
84-1_2231.118_5.52.wav_ASR	uh c which i could remember the name of the place that he was involved in my yeah
84-1_2237.538_4.0.wav_ASR	but he he has one spon who's got three wonderful child
84-1_2242.058_2.84.wav_ASR	they live in in northern jir
84-1_2245.216_14.64.wav_ASR	so my my friend who's now is has fixed up a place i think in the fifty or sixties in new year
84-1_2260.677_6.594.wav_ASR	so i know that's where the party is gonna be because the apartement is apparently finished now
84-1_2267.297_1.81.wav_ASR	he's been working on it for a couple of years
84-1_2290.78_3.59.wav_ASR	oh interestingly enough i had one for lunch
84-1_2296.1_4.56.wav_ASR	um i like it once in a while
84-1_2300.734_16.34.wav_ASR	one of the people who was in who one of the people who's part of the group of sixty five or sixty six
84-1_2317.101_4.2.wav_ASR	and he has a pen pot and a jelly sandwich every day for lunch
84-1_2321.761_2.78.wav_ASR	well what you do is you take two pieces of brown
84-1_2325.321_9.159.wav_ASR	um um i have my bread um i have my bread and the freezer 'cause i only use a certain amount
84-1_2335.061_1.789.wav_ASR	so i take the pieces of the bread
84-1_2336.89_7.96.wav_ASR	uh i i they become they come to room target
84-1_2347.07_2.92.wav_ASR	then i have a special pendent but i use
84-1_2350.01_1.08.wav_ASR	it would be too costly
84-1_2353.6_1.85.wav_ASR	well the p. d. battery there is natural
84-1_2356.05_2.9.wav_ASR	so um that's the pendent battery i buy
84-1_2359.35_3.68.wav_ASR	and i would we have a huge charger of that around
84-1_2363.63_3.48.wav_ASR	so i would open the jar take some pendent butter
84-1_2367.83_2.504.wav_ASR	and then i would take different kinds of colour
84-1_2370.434_9.058.wav_ASR	but right now i'm on a kick where i have um it's like broccoli strawberry and raspberry together in a mix
84-1_2380.014_1.86.wav_ASR	and i put that on the sandwich
84-1_2382.514_2.34.wav_ASR	then i close the sandwich
84-1_2385.454_3.553.wav_ASR	and you can either um cut it in half or leave it whole
84-1_2389.007_2.9.wav_ASR	and for some stupid reason i always leave it on
84-1_2392.387_1.62.wav_ASR	and i had
84-1_2394.347_5.34.wav_ASR	oh i had so i had that about one third as i was preparing for my two o'clock call
84-1_2413.71_5.31.wav_ASR	well spongy is something i still tried to do but i think my wife t probably does more of it
84-1_2420.092_4.906.wav_ASR	oh i would choose what kind of territory i would want it
84-1_2424.998_6.36.wav_ASR	but typically i would choose cold water because most of the stuff i need to watch is cold water
84-1_2431.958_3.042.wav_ASR	so i would in the special we have a machine
84-1_2435.278_2.14.wav_ASR	we live in the in the part
84-1_2437.656_7.8.wav_ASR	but we live in an area that used to be that was where we have to buy the component
84-1_2446.076_9.42.wav_ASR	but because we're getting ready to move next year we sold in the same building
84-1_2455.617_4.36.wav_ASR	so we would um we would get the whiter side
84-1_2461.32_13.017.wav_ASR	we would um once the wire set it's a machine that it it comes out on the side
84-1_2474.39_1.33.wav_ASR	so there's nothing on the top
84-1_2476.55_1.89.wav_ASR	oh we have to mold the watch
84-1_2479.39_8.06.wav_ASR	and then we put the the the the in it and start it
84-1_2487.48_6.74.wav_ASR	and you can see it um from the um from the we can see it from the
84-1_2495.135_8.325.wav_ASR	now it's not something that is it's something that is um easy to see from the floor
84-1_2504.52_2.52.wav_ASR	and so we put it on wire
84-1_2507.302_4.58.wav_ASR	and it usually lasts for some reason for a few minutes
84-1_2512.062_3.808.wav_ASR	but after an hour and five minutes the wash is done
84-1_2515.962_6.0.wav_ASR	if we have particular clothes that need to put on the line we would typically put it on the line
84-1_2522.162_4.18.wav_ASR	the rest of it would go into the dryer where it would dry
84-1_2526.352_8.24.wav_ASR	and then it would be ready to be folded and put in the couple of drawers that we use for for um wrong
84-1_2535.332_2.932.wav_ASR	um my wife has quite a few more than i do
84-1_2538.264_8.158.wav_ASR	but um it's a place where we can put our stuff um and um use it as we as we need to
84-1_2557.42_3.87.wav_ASR	well you have to understand that now i have it takes me a while
84-1_2562.42_5.82.wav_ASR	um so i usually get up in the morning
84-1_2568.47_8.6.wav_ASR	and i have to i will put on my underwear
84-1_2578.86_3.09.wav_ASR	and then i would put on my
84-1_2583.37_2.06.wav_ASR	and i would put on my side
84-1_2586.38_6.68.wav_ASR	and then i would lie in bed for a little bit to do some exercise
84-1_2593.52_9.62.wav_ASR	supposedly even though i'm never more than three years old it's still important for me to um get some exercise and every day
84-1_2603.74_0.96.wav_ASR	or i do that
84-1_2604.776_5.64.wav_ASR	and then i will typically once that is done i'll turn on the t. v.
84-1_2610.876_6.2.wav_ASR	and i'll get dressed the rest of my day which includes um my sigh
84-1_2617.536_4.7.wav_ASR	you haven't seen this but i wear a price on my right foot
84-1_2622.416_1.873.wav_ASR	so i put that on as well
84-1_2624.77_4.28.wav_ASR	and i um i start my day
84-2_12.09_1.1.wav_ASR	my favourite colour
84-2_13.79_9.28.wav_ASR	um it's easily thank giving um 'cause i have a very small family but usually the family comes as well as my two spongy
84-2_24.03_1.468.wav_ASR	now one of them's memory
84-2_25.77_2.32.wav_ASR	but the and the others gonna be married pretty soon
84-2_28.25_4.26.wav_ASR	so i looked forward to a table with m a few more people
84-2_32.564_2.32.wav_ASR	um i have two sisters
84-2_35.624_2.44.wav_ASR	one of them who lies i think i told you in north
84-2_38.244_1.46.wav_ASR	one of them
84-2_40.424_2.76.wav_ASR	um so they typically come
84-2_43.573_14.028.wav_ASR	and um for many many years i have um until i had my stroke i was in charge of the cutting of the turkey which i do on a grid
84-2_58.053_1.58.wav_ASR	so it's really really nice
84-2_60.413_2.52.wav_ASR	now i don't do it on the green anymore
84-2_63.47_4.5.wav_ASR	and we had a used to have a place at the shore but we don't have that anymore
84-2_68.71_4.28.wav_ASR	so i somebody else cuts it in the oven
84-2_78.94_7.65.wav_ASR	well i've been the hose for thanks giving since my mother died in ninety nine
84-2_86.96_1.04.wav_ASR	so it's been a while
84-2_92.66_0.372.wav_ASR	it is
84-2_93.22_2.6.wav_ASR	it's it's nice but it doesn't last very long
84-2_100.512_2.1.wav_ASR	oh we celebrate hong kong
84-2_103.112_6.44.wav_ASR	um so we don't we we typically we don't even give presentation any more
84-2_109.668_11.36.wav_ASR	and unfortunately both of the young ladies that my two sons married are both not
84-2_121.788_3.708.wav_ASR	one of them i think has no relation which is fine with me
84-2_125.777_3.18.wav_ASR	and one of them i think is basically
84-2_130.297_4.6.wav_ASR	but um i think she likes celebrating holiday as well
84-2_154.92_3.84.wav_ASR	kind of speech is probably the thing that i'm working on the most
84-2_159.16_7.84.wav_ASR	as you know i used to be a lawyer and i just i just went back on the actuality
84-2_167.46_3.07.wav_ASR	um so i can still be a lawyer if i wanted to be a lawyer
84-2_171.22_15.68.wav_ASR	but i i feel that a lot of times is especially with small words and pronouns and with um his and her and left and right i'm still a little i'm not great with
84-2_187.36_3.34.wav_ASR	but that uh that like i have to think for a while
84-2_190.722_2.64.wav_ASR	especially now that lower does mo
84-2_193.622_1.4.wav_ASR	or
84-2_195.302_2.954.wav_ASR	but i have to remember like which is left and which is right
84-2_198.782_1.54.wav_ASR	and inputs me some time
84-2_200.742_3.33.wav_ASR	and i'm i'm pretty good about backward and forward
84-2_204.582_2.796.wav_ASR	and i'm hoping that i'll be able to drive it some point
84-2_207.378_8.784.wav_ASR	but not that i really want to drive because i've never i i've always written a lot but i've never been i've never been particularly interested in dark
84-2_216.44_9.7.wav_ASR	just do it 'cause my white sits in the other seat and my ma i two kids when they were round um sometimes they would drive but sometimes they would avoid
84-2_227.22_6.2.wav_ASR	but um but now since my stroke my wife does all the drawing
84-2_234.05_6.33.wav_ASR	and as i say i think maybe in a year or so i may be able to start driving again
84-2_240.74_0.76.wav_ASR	um i'm i'm not sure
84-2_247.16_2.58.wav_ASR	um don't tell my wife that
84-2_257.54_0.74.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
84-2_263.0_2.98.wav_ASR	oh yeah i i remember my stroke pretty well
84-2_273.18_11.211.wav_ASR	well i was in the household for about eight days before i went to the rehab program which is also connected to um cameras giffes and hammers
84-2_285.39_20.682.wav_ASR	and that's where in my area of town which is n near now instead of going down to pen which is probably ten blocks from here we go down to jasper which is probably ten blocks away
84-2_306.65_15.44.wav_ASR	and i remember i remember i remember i told you that on saturday morning i went out to get i went out because there was a rite the night before from um the guy up and minis
84-2_322.53_1.5.wav_ASR	forget his name right now
84-2_324.03_2.88.wav_ASR	um so there's a huge right
84-2_327.03_2.723.wav_ASR	we had a building actually burned here
84-2_330.29_4.617.wav_ASR	and i went out um i went out of the about six o'clock in the morning to start cleaning up
84-2_335.07_2.209.wav_ASR	and i was one of the few people out there
84-2_337.63_2.1.wav_ASR	and i remember that being a kind of clean up
84-2_339.843_5.105.wav_ASR	and um so i was there for about six to nine o'clock in the morning
84-2_345.103_1.957.wav_ASR	and then i went to get a news paper
84-2_347.387_0.994.wav_ASR	it didn't feel great
84-2_348.683_2.769.wav_ASR	or a light light led down for a little bit
84-2_351.763_2.48.wav_ASR	and then i went to work in the afternoon
84-2_354.303_6.287.wav_ASR	and by the even i was starting to feel o a little worried but not terribly worried
84-2_361.05_2.15.wav_ASR	and i went to bed around ten thirty
84-2_364.003_2.577.wav_ASR	and i had my stroke in the middle of the night
84-2_367.183_3.063.wav_ASR	and the morning my wife could not get a hold of me
84-2_370.723_2.645.wav_ASR	so we have a customiser who came up and fight me
84-2_373.648_1.7.wav_ASR	and they took me to the hospital
84-2_375.668_2.58.wav_ASR	that's when i spend about eight days in the hostel
84-2_378.928_4.34.wav_ASR	because um because i was drawing cobra
84-2_383.468_2.537.wav_ASR	so i really didn't see anybody there
84-2_386.828_5.56.wav_ASR	and i had um it was difficult from me 'cause i feel felt my talking was not great
84-2_392.4_3.057.wav_ASR	and i also it was it was just difficult for me
84-2_395.58_4.82.wav_ASR	so it was um i mean i must have watched t. v.
84-2_400.74_2.02.wav_ASR	and i i was in a room by myself
84-2_402.991_12.52.wav_ASR	and um eventually on a mando right a about a week and a couple days later i went to maggie which is only about six blocks away
84-2_415.551_0.838.wav_ASR	it was pretty close
84-2_416.971_3.157.wav_ASR	um so that's when i stayed for three for two months
84-2_430.74_2.047.wav_ASR	oh well i've done a lot of things to try to get better
84-2_433.0_1.662.wav_ASR	uh i don't know if all that works but
84-2_435.24_3.841.wav_ASR	so i was in the household for four eight weeks
84-2_439.239_9.64.wav_ASR	and every day except the weekends i had um i had um i had um i had o. t. and p. t.
84-2_449.599_1.36.wav_ASR	and then i also had speech
84-2_451.039_1.499.wav_ASR	that was a little bit in the morning
84-2_453.139_4.394.wav_ASR	and then in the afternoon i for a while i didn't do anything
84-2_457.533_3.458.wav_ASR	but then i started going to art
84-2_461.433_4.9.wav_ASR	and i i did some stuff but it wasn't really very good
84-2_467.093_6.865.wav_ASR	but i thought by the time i left there um i wasn't so sure i was gonna do it
84-2_474.15_7.18.wav_ASR	um so i tried it a little bit more at m. g. which is um where i go for output
84-2_481.83_0.958.wav_ASR	and it wasn't great
84-2_483.11_2.78.wav_ASR	so they introduced a music program
84-2_486.65_2.184.wav_ASR	and i was always interested in singing
84-2_489.35_2.38.wav_ASR	but i don't sing a lot
84-2_491.79_3.961.wav_ASR	and i don't see i'm afraid i don't always sing on key
84-2_496.23_1.816.wav_ASR	or i thought it might be good
84-2_498.25_2.78.wav_ASR	so i took some singing lessons which i still take
84-2_501.63_4.7.wav_ASR	then also at template um there's an a. f. g. program
84-2_506.586_10.4.wav_ASR	and so there's a singing program there which i think i like better because i get real songs instead of music
84-2_517.118_19.5.wav_ASR	and i also on a on a on a on a on a um we're on something called impact where we tried to do stuff to help people learn about a phase and um see see how we can help other people who have a phase
84-2_563.78_6.71.wav_ASR	well i have a lot of good experiences 'cause i had a pretty positive life
84-2_570.49_11.14.wav_ASR	but i spent up until first grade i went to school in a suburb of cleve and a suburban of cleve hill of cleveland called soft
84-2_582.166_13.72.wav_ASR	and then between my between my first and second grade years i'm moved to schedule and w was in a really nice sub group there called
84-2_596.144_6.909.wav_ASR	and um so growing up i i i was participating in a lot of different things
84-2_603.184_3.92.wav_ASR	it was not a great effort but i was an okay enough faddy
84-2_607.264_4.74.wav_ASR	so i usually make it the last player on the team with the second last player on the team
84-2_612.29_4.45.wav_ASR	and i really like playing hockey which we did out doors at the tournament
84-2_617.81_12.14.wav_ASR	um so i would say i learned a lot of expertise from haku just um just about the game and about you know how to set up different play
84-2_630.86_17.583.wav_ASR	and and eventually um eventually when i was in my what's called the b sample library which is fourteen and fifteen i was made captive of the team
84-2_648.56_1.971.wav_ASR	that was a really nice start
84-2_650.531_4.636.wav_ASR	and i was um and it was a good time from me
84-2_655.371_2.836.wav_ASR	uh my i was on the b. team i was not on the e. team
84-2_658.411_5.549.wav_ASR	but um but there's enough players on the b. team that i would pretty frequently with
84-2_664.191_1.68.wav_ASR	and all of them were form factor
84-2_666.031_2.66.wav_ASR	so it was okay in north field
84-2_668.951_1.04.wav_ASR	it's in the silver side
84-2_670.145_2.671.wav_ASR	so it was really nice to meet all the people
84-2_673.365_10.54.wav_ASR	and we would have games um basically from latest and from latest and from like
84-2_684.865_2.36.wav_ASR	so it was just nice to get to know some people
84-2_693.81_2.2.wav_ASR	but i did get a hard disk
84-2_696.361_5.44.wav_ASR	uh wrote my um i'd drop my colour but
84-2_706.07_1.072.wav_ASR	it wasn't that big
84-2_710.85_1.037.wav_ASR	it it can be
84-2_712.13_2.397.wav_ASR	but um it wasn't bad from
84-2_714.67_2.22.wav_ASR	maybe it wasn't a particularly bad
84-2_717.63_4.6.wav_ASR	but i remember i came home and i still wasn't feeling great
84-2_722.231_11.86.wav_ASR	so my dad took me to um what was then called eight hundred and a half percentage from down
84-2_735.0_4.82.wav_ASR	and so um i remember i did some extra things and some other thing
84-2_740.071_1.66.wav_ASR	and they said i had a rough colour
84-2_741.98_7.66.wav_ASR	so i um i was i i think it you know i think i b i actually broke my colour ball
84-2_751.48_1.24.wav_ASR	maybe it was only once
84-2_753.1_1.699.wav_ASR	then i also broke my wrist
84-2_755.56_1.969.wav_ASR	but i can't remember exactly how i did that
84-2_765.892_4.149.wav_ASR	yeah you you can't have a um you can't have a cash on that
84-2_776.028_1.013.wav_ASR	it
84-2_777.152_1.08.wav_ASR	you hold it
84-2_781.243_1.08.wav_ASR	alright oh well
84-2_785.063_2.76.wav_ASR	uh yeah so did you did you did that in colledge too
84-2_797.763_0.72.wav_ASR	good
84-2_845.89_2.26.wav_ASR	oh yeah that's the same thing we saw last
84-2_858.01_2.94.wav_ASR	so it's the story of a young man
84-2_861.0_5.48.wav_ASR	would say he's around twelve euros old kicking a soccer ball
84-2_867.26_13.14.wav_ASR	and i guess one of the random kicks went through a plate glass and landed next to some one who was probably either reading or maybe watching t. v.
84-2_880.69_3.33.wav_ASR	and so he saw the ball coming at him
84-2_884.43_10.34.wav_ASR	and he n he noticed that a lamp had come a lamp had come to rest uh and um beside him
84-2_895.09_3.248.wav_ASR	and i could see i could see the ball coming at
84-2_898.338_2.865.wav_ASR	so he might have cut the ball
84-2_902.03_2.001.wav_ASR	and he wasn't sure what to do
84-2_904.138_2.02.wav_ASR	so he saw that the glass was broken
84-2_906.678_4.26.wav_ASR	so we went over to the window to see what had happened
84-2_911.418_4.592.wav_ASR	and i'm assuming that he saw the person who kicked the sugar bowl
84-2_916.01_6.4.wav_ASR	but then perhaps but by then perhaps the person with the sugar bowl had run away
84-2_930.177_7.24.wav_ASR	um so it's the story of a young boy who was on his way to school
84-2_938.237_5.22.wav_ASR	and um he wasn't sure that he needed a rubber
84-2_943.61_7.119.wav_ASR	so he decided that he wouldn't take an umbrella because it maybe didn't look like it was gonna rain
84-2_951.25_5.94.wav_ASR	but as soon as she stepped outside and started walking a little bit the rain came down
84-2_957.89_1.84.wav_ASR	oh he went back to his house
84-2_959.73_4.444.wav_ASR	and i he was o all he was all dead
84-2_964.39_3.26.wav_ASR	and his mother had a strange look on his face
84-2_967.95_1.755.wav_ASR	but there was nothing he could do
84-2_969.89_4.927.wav_ASR	so he got some new clothes and went back out into the rain
84-2_975.35_1.92.wav_ASR	this time he had an opener
84-2_988.79_6.25.wav_ASR	this is the picture of a young lady who had a cat stuck up in a tree
84-2_995.279_8.66.wav_ASR	so he got off his bicycle and s saw i think what must have been his dad
84-2_1004.61_2.312.wav_ASR	his dead climbed up the tree
84-2_1007.139_3.56.wav_ASR	and then the battery broke and fell to the ground
84-2_1011.04_7.14.wav_ASR	there is a a poppy who's trying to see if maybe the man or could come down
84-2_1018.34_18.709.wav_ASR	but sh he was up there and needed to be recorded by the finder department who came over and was going to get the get the got the phone
84-2_1188.82_0.522.wav_ASR	got yeah
84-2_1190.29_11.04.wav_ASR	well so this is a story about sinderella and her two i think there were probably step daughters and her old um
84-2_1202.87_5.93.wav_ASR	um so i believe that sinderella needed some help
84-2_1208.85_10.08.wav_ASR	and since she was um on her own she was able to get a job with the two stepisters and the step mom
84-2_1219.6_12.86.wav_ASR	and she was doing a lot of stuff like watching the clothes and cleaning the um cleaning the floors and doing stuff like that and providing the um cleaning the floors and doing stuff like that
84-2_1233.61_13.66.wav_ASR	then it came to pass that there was a price who lived in the castle with his father and mother and perhaps some sisters and brothers
84-2_1247.87_7.51.wav_ASR	and sh he was s he was looking for somebody to follow and love with
84-2_1255.91_10.09.wav_ASR	so they everybody in the town got an invitation to this big party that they were gonna have
84-2_1266.0_7.976.wav_ASR	so the two stepisters dress up in fine clothes and the mister went with them
84-2_1273.976_12.38.wav_ASR	and they were they went to the the the the print the king was looking for
84-2_1286.996_3.0.wav_ASR	and so sh he decided to have this party
84-2_1290.119_5.02.wav_ASR	and um so they were they were at the party
84-2_1295.299_12.78.wav_ASR	and then a very good but came along and said to the young one sinderer that's cinderella should go to the party too
84-2_1308.226_9.88.wav_ASR	so he she was able to get a dress and some nice clothing including a some beautiful shoe
84-2_1319.006_8.0.wav_ASR	and they were they were in some how invested to the web
84-2_1327.231_10.9.wav_ASR	and they came to the wedding and a special charger which had a rider and i think of uh someone who was in the back
84-2_1338.211_7.36.wav_ASR	and they came out at the at the um that the the colour at the part
84-2_1345.673_6.279.wav_ASR	and um the the the print was there
84-2_1352.133_2.54.wav_ASR	and the print so it's in
84-2_1355.293_3.02.wav_ASR	and they had a very good time
84-2_1358.335_10.88.wav_ASR	but the price had the price that the the synergy had been told that she needed to be home by mid
84-2_1370.035_5.014.wav_ASR	so as the clock struck twelve she knew she had to get out
84-2_1375.049_3.707.wav_ASR	so he left and left the print there
84-2_1378.756_17.48.wav_ASR	and as he went out to the camera the the uh like a surface um cinetis turned back into a to a uh like a surface
84-2_1396.299_11.02.wav_ASR	they um yeah and um the print print was really updated about what had happened
84-2_1407.593_17.28.wav_ASR	so she he sent some people from the from the from his from his is like his word he's s he's like his partner from his class to see if they could find
84-2_1425.678_6.62.wav_ASR	and so she went to he went to different houses and could not find any but
84-2_1432.618_11.82.wav_ASR	when he went to the house where the two zap sisters lived she was wanting to know if anybody else was there
84-2_1444.93_13.02.wav_ASR	and somehow i think maybe he figured out that the that the young lady was in the other room
84-2_1458.25_1.72.wav_ASR	so he brought up
84-2_1460.57_2.92.wav_ASR	and the shoes fit
84-2_1463.42_8.56.wav_ASR	so he went back to the print and told him about this poor
84-2_1472.66_6.16.wav_ASR	and eventually the person became close again with the print
84-2_1480.57_3.74.wav_ASR	and and in the end the price and the size got matter
84-2_1514.01_3.94.wav_ASR	don't remember what i talked about last week
84-2_1518.63_6.689.wav_ASR	um so there was always a clock in my house growing up
84-2_1526.11_3.865.wav_ASR	and so i i knew pretty easily what time it was
84-2_1530.23_1.698.wav_ASR	oh i think i know the story
84-2_1531.9_8.72.wav_ASR	and so i remember uh specially in the high school that there wasn't really any time i had to be home
84-2_1541.12_5.3.wav_ASR	so my parents said that you know when you get home it's fine
84-2_1546.84_4.825.wav_ASR	um you know obviously not too late but you know you want to have a good time
84-2_1551.665_5.02.wav_ASR	so especially on friday and saturday nights we used to go out
84-2_1556.735_4.043.wav_ASR	used to draw beer in one of my friends' basement and then go out
84-2_1561.105_4.17.wav_ASR	and um so we would go to the different parts which was a lot of fun
84-2_1565.275_7.34.wav_ASR	but i always made it home except one time i actually felt a sleep a little at the wheel
84-2_1573.075_7.54.wav_ASR	but i was um i was in the i was b i was driving
84-2_1580.922_5.48.wav_ASR	it's nobody else named one of my friends who was named tivo was in the other
84-2_1587.065_3.064.wav_ASR	and um he he killed me
84-2_1590.202_0.83.wav_ASR	they walk up
84-2_1591.802_1.28.wav_ASR	but it was in the top
84-2_1593.302_0.94.wav_ASR	so nothing happen
84-2_1594.562_1.16.wav_ASR	ah it was pretty lucky
84-2_1595.743_6.552.wav_ASR	um so i guess it it's just good to know that a clock is always there now knowing what time it is
84-2_1602.295_18.18.wav_ASR	and and hopefully um i i w then when i was in college i used to i did a couple different girls where i was from in um in wednesday kendra worth and in um
84-2_1621.213_5.323.wav_ASR	and so i had a jump that started at six o' clock in the morning during the summer
84-2_1626.636_8.781.wav_ASR	so i used to s stay out with my friends or at my girlfriend's house and tell about until until four in the morning and then go go to work
84-2_1635.473_3.123.wav_ASR	or i would come home and get my bike and then go to work
84-2_1638.596_3.3.wav_ASR	so it was fun but it was also pretty expensive
84-2_1661.747_12.78.wav_ASR	think the only thing i can say about birds is that um growing up i pretty tough pr pretty much tough
84-2_1674.744_11.46.wav_ASR	and i remember even when i was in um underground and when i went to the lowest i i mean i never really thought about but
84-2_1686.85_16.941.wav_ASR	but as i as i as i i guess i should say that i worked a lot in when i was in um when i w i guess i should say that i worked a lot in when i was in um when i was in um when i was a lawyer
84-2_1703.791_4.937.wav_ASR	and then i went to a a company um where i was for a long time
84-2_1709.271_8.12.wav_ASR	but now that i'm now that i'm looking for stuff to do one of the things i'm pretty interested in doing is bird wire
84-2_1718.071_2.377.wav_ASR	so it's something i'm gonna try to do
84-2_1720.448_13.26.wav_ASR	but i'm sure i told you but maybe i didn't that my that me and my wife are gonna move to south america and in the communication there where i feel i can do some bird watch
84-2_1734.128_1.611.wav_ASR	so i'd like to try it
84-2_1735.948_1.252.wav_ASR	uh i hope i'm good at it
84-2_1737.348_1.265.wav_ASR	yeah but i know what i'm doing
84-2_1738.613_8.402.wav_ASR	but it's um important from me to find some hubs that i can work on and try to get feel feel good about it
84-2_1751.233_2.428.wav_ASR	oh oh we've already picked the place
84-2_1753.973_1.755.wav_ASR	yeah
84-2_1755.813_0.848.wav_ASR	you never been there
84-2_1757.804_3.6.wav_ASR	yeah it's off the coast of um
84-2_1763.495_4.149.wav_ASR	so about forty minutes from the charger and air pump
84-2_1768.604_1.36.wav_ASR	and it's a beautiful
84-2_1772.244_3.34.wav_ASR	oh i don't wanna go into too much detail
84-2_1775.781_12.445.wav_ASR	but um we we are constructing a place there that's part of a condomium that's right on the beach
84-2_1788.901_5.343.wav_ASR	and so um so i my wife is down there right now
84-2_1794.244_5.8.wav_ASR	oh so she could actually go into the building which is being constructed
84-2_1800.532_16.3.wav_ASR	and she was able to tell me that from my from where our kind of menu is placed my wife says that she can actually see the the speech you know for the onset
84-2_1817.192_13.006.wav_ASR	so for me that was really nice because i've always m i used to have a place in the upper mirror which my r white really like that i didn't like so much it
84-2_1830.198_1.1.wav_ASR	it's the
84-2_1831.912_4.94.wav_ASR	and so now i feel that i've been able to give something you know
84-2_1837.124_5.433.wav_ASR	some i wanted to find a place that would be good for her
84-2_1843.004_3.038.wav_ASR	and i think i mean it's gonna be a little hot for me
84-2_1846.364_6.04.wav_ASR	but i think it's gonna be worth it um because it's gonna be a great place from my wife
84-2_1861.804_4.88.wav_ASR	li little head it is in is it's in soft coloured or not coloured
84-2_1868.964_0.303.wav_ASR	oh
84-2_1877.712_1.04.wav_ASR	well it's pretty curvy
84-2_1879.112_1.64.wav_ASR	and i'm not very concerved so
84-2_1882.912_1.763.wav_ASR	yeah but i think it should be good
84-2_1885.012_4.164.wav_ASR	um we know some people down there who live there
84-2_1889.212_1.86.wav_ASR	so that's gonna be really helpful too
84-2_1891.217_9.274.wav_ASR	but the per the person i know really well made a forward in um in a company that he was in
84-2_1900.657_4.7.wav_ASR	so he has a lot of places now all over the world including key one
84-2_1929.085_7.92.wav_ASR	well probably the whole tell i stayed in some nice hotel
84-2_1937.925_5.3.wav_ASR	but probably the nicest hotel i stayed in was for my wedding
84-2_1943.216_11.64.wav_ASR	um i'm married uh a a a low student um when i was in law school who um lived in wassau
84-2_1955.736_3.62.wav_ASR	so we got married at the four seasons' history and jordan
84-2_1960.256_1.29.wav_ASR	that was a real nice place
84-2_1961.546_2.702.wav_ASR	so we we were able to be there for a couple of days
84-2_1964.566_2.56.wav_ASR	we had a fair amount of people at our meeting
84-2_1967.137_1.529.wav_ASR	think it was about two hundred
84-2_1969.686_5.86.wav_ASR	the um w we were able to have a webbing on a spongy after
84-2_1976.586_2.56.wav_ASR	and um we had a nice lunch
84-2_1979.209_12.504.wav_ASR	and then i remember that m many of my friends went down to a bar um further down in my friends and some friends and had a nice meeting there
84-2_1992.089_1.731.wav_ASR	oh for me it was a good place
84-2_1994.369_2.18.wav_ASR	um but surely i like being home
84-2_1996.549_3.359.wav_ASR	so i you know i did it
84-2_1999.989_0.545.wav_ASR	was good
84-2_2000.709_3.348.wav_ASR	it you know i like being where i am now
84-2_2196.154_4.351.wav_ASR	well i think i told you about my favourite restaurant in the new euro right
84-2_2200.505_1.925.wav_ASR	one that i went to for about twenty years
84-2_2204.4_1.8.wav_ASR	oh i won't talk about that
84-2_2206.653_12.64.wav_ASR	um well here in middle of uh i've got to know a few rasta
84-2_2219.853_5.936.wav_ASR	so i lived here when i first when i first took a job
84-2_2225.789_3.92.wav_ASR	uh i was a low code for a judge and a film director
84-2_2230.669_3.36.wav_ASR	and then i left here for a while before i moved to print it
84-2_2234.197_14.716.wav_ASR	but one of the places i'd like to eat a lot although it's gone up and price a little bit is a research call part
84-2_2249.537_1.139.wav_ASR	and i don't know
84-2_2250.676_4.494.wav_ASR	but um i used to be able to speak french pretty well
84-2_2255.756_5.814.wav_ASR	and i like going there because they have a lot of good food
84-2_2262.196_5.2.wav_ASR	most of which is again two it's got to be over price like so many reset
84-2_2267.49_9.604.wav_ASR	but one thing i really like there is my um my they have a handbarger that's really nice
84-2_2277.79_5.42.wav_ASR	it's and it'd be and it can be good different way
84-2_2283.415_9.06.wav_ASR	and i like my meet very very rough um uh not good not completely good but cut most of the way
84-2_2293.155_8.88.wav_ASR	um it's a really nice place to get a gummy burger and either a salad or some um some french
84-2_2302.33_4.163.wav_ASR	so if if but the french ries are usually for my wife
84-2_2307.01_2.4.wav_ASR	so i usually wind up getting a se a side
84-2_2309.77_7.26.wav_ASR	but sometimes she makes me order the the the um she makes me order the
84-2_2336.29_0.91.wav_ASR	oh we had this too
84-2_2337.64_6.1.wav_ASR	well the pino button and the g. s. w. for me is pretty easy to make
84-2_2344.78_4.14.wav_ASR	you go to the most of my bread is in the freezer
84-2_2349.56_2.46.wav_ASR	so i take out two pieces of red
84-2_2352.03_13.906.wav_ASR	i like a particular kind of um pen product that is made at um costly button that is made at um canvas which has nothing but pens in it
84-2_2365.936_10.164.wav_ASR	so i usually put when i have a p. d. b. controller so that later has to be according a little more frequently for some reason i don't know
84-2_2376.676_2.695.wav_ASR	um and then i'll take just about any channel
84-2_2379.371_10.336.wav_ASR	but i found a jolly at um i think that um wedges that has three different types of fruit it
84-2_2389.5_27.09.wav_ASR	and so i put that with some with some um with the pendent but on a red that is um a broad that is um a type of wheel but i find to be too very
84-2_2416.69_4.042.wav_ASR	so i'm i'm gonna have a schedule a little later today
84-2_2420.83_1.92.wav_ASR	and i'm probably gonna have a turkey so
84-2_2423.13_2.155.wav_ASR	but yeah i like pino button
84-2_2425.63_8.46.wav_ASR	you got the i've got the i've got the i've got the spongy down to a sides
84-2_2440.382_15.965.wav_ASR	well we i think i may have told you that we used to limit the hell
84-2_2456.416_4.325.wav_ASR	but we found somewhere that we thought we could sell it to
84-2_2460.976_7.3.wav_ASR	and it turned out that he sh the two of them bought it at a price that i think was pretty good
84-2_2468.485_11.2.wav_ASR	so while we're waiting for the place to be built in um k. e. r. we've moved it turns out across the hall where there's a remote unit
84-2_2479.5_13.0.wav_ASR	and so and there's a washer and a dryer with the remote with all the with all the with all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the all the
84-2_2493.08_0.68.wav_ASR	the rooms
84-2_2494.18_4.5.wav_ASR	all the locations i guess you could say have a washer and a dryer
84-2_2499.03_7.61.wav_ASR	so usually there may be a couple pieces of cloth that may go to the white clean
84-2_2506.81_8.7.wav_ASR	but for the most part i will um i will open the i will open the
84-2_2516.541_5.6.wav_ASR	it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's
84-2_2522.721_4.203.wav_ASR	so i put all the clothes in which is something i'm still able to do
84-2_2527.541_5.5.wav_ASR	and um then i will turn on the wash
84-2_2533.721_1.86.wav_ASR	usually it's on a cold side
84-2_2535.923_4.6.wav_ASR	and once it starts moving a little bit i put in the
84-2_2541.603_5.972.wav_ASR	and for some reason this this worries takes a long time
84-2_2548.263_2.18.wav_ASR	but in about an hour it's done
84-2_2550.963_2.58.wav_ASR	and the clothes have always come up pretty clean
84-2_2553.677_3.5.wav_ASR	so i then put them in the drawer
84-2_2558.157_3.06.wav_ASR	and that's about another forty five minutes
84-2_2561.777_10.454.wav_ASR	but usually th within two hours um the clothes come out and they're ready to be folded which for me takes a while 'cause i only have the one hand
84-2_2572.231_6.68.wav_ASR	so what i've tried to do is just limit the stuff that i like the stuff that goes in my clothes
84-2_2579.691_1.311.wav_ASR	and lower
84-2_2582.091_6.46.wav_ASR	yeah she she her clothes get washed with mine but i can't really put them away
84-2_2588.911_1.977.wav_ASR	she's got a lot more clothing than i do
84-2_2605.921_5.7.wav_ASR	well i i grew up with a lot of power
84-2_2612.441_6.897.wav_ASR	but somehow when i mattered lower that was not one of the things that she was really interested in
84-2_2619.338_7.26.wav_ASR	so we have a l we we have a few not a lot of fake flowers around our apart
84-2_2627.098_3.1.wav_ASR	um i had a birthday in march
84-2_2630.778_6.74.wav_ASR	and um one of the people i'd become very close with is a personal trainer name gina
84-2_2637.618_7.84.wav_ASR	and so um gina has been with me for i think now for about two and a half years
84-2_2645.678_7.36.wav_ASR	and she got a small plate from me that is the only little part in this apart
84-2_2654.178_0.9.wav_ASR	and for some reason
84-2_2655.359_3.54.wav_ASR	but i got it at the end of
84-2_2661.499_3.353.wav_ASR	and for some reason the plan is still jogging along
84-2_2664.959_0.989.wav_ASR	it's doing pretty well
84-2_2666.159_8.647.wav_ASR	oh i feel good that i can keep a plate now for what is it um four months
84-2_2681.403_5.463.wav_ASR	and i think the biggest success is is that i don't have to worry it very often
84-2_2689.146_3.773.wav_ASR	but i can show it to you but i don't know what it is
84-2_2692.919_6.577.wav_ASR	maybe at the end if we have enough time i see if i can see it
84-2_2699.679_5.76.wav_ASR	but it i it's just hard to see 'cause it's on the window
84-2_2707.71_1.15.wav_ASR	oh it's a bit on plain
84-2_2725.24_2.756.wav_ASR	well find the easiest ones to start with
54-1_7.551_3.64.wav_ASR	yeah
54-1_21.615_0.5.wav_ASR	oh
54-1_45.538_0.63.wav_ASR	oh

54-1_65.795_0.53.wav_ASR	oh yeah
54-1_67.255_0.52.wav_ASR	don't know
54-1_79.297_1.64.wav_ASR	oh

61-1_8.815_2.07.wav_ASR	um better
61-1_11.161_1.12.wav_ASR	but it's not
61-1_18.98_0.59.wav_ASR	yes
61-1_25.037_0.33.wav_ASR	yeah
61-1_26.772_10.59.wav_ASR	um first of all i i had i had um a sensitivity i
61-1_37.381_1.15.wav_ASR	i couldn't speak
61-1_38.607_5.59.wav_ASR	and then as all i started speaking again
61-1_45.366_12.18.wav_ASR	and um i was two forty seven ten uh um ninety
61-1_58.751_15.99.wav_ASR	so so i asked to see um go to the um um
61-1_76.25_3.64.wav_ASR	and when i got there he couldn't find it wrong with me
61-1_80.439_7.66.wav_ASR	but he he thought thought he would put me in um a place
61-1_88.709_1.3.wav_ASR	and they put me in
61-1_90.349_3.38.wav_ASR	they hold me up and didn't even think
61-1_95.155_1.83.wav_ASR	and i was doing fine
61-1_97.039_1.31.wav_ASR	uh i i thought fine
61-1_98.399_1.83.wav_ASR	and i was talking fine
61-1_100.966_6.14.wav_ASR	and um the doctor came in and was going to discuss me
61-1_107.936_1.9.wav_ASR	and i couldn't talk
61-1_111.68_0.89.wav_ASR	and so he goes
61-1_112.95_2.58.wav_ASR	oh i think better stay
61-1_117.965_4.57.wav_ASR	and then um
61-1_123.467_9.27.wav_ASR	and um the nerves was supposed to help me go to the r re stress room but um she didn't
61-1_133.067_3.3.wav_ASR	and i went in to the restaurant
61-1_136.391_1.53.wav_ASR	and i stumbled and fell
61-1_140.685_3.91.wav_ASR	and um they got me off
61-1_144.655_8.54.wav_ASR	and and um they took me down to do another head stand
61-1_154.705_13.28.wav_ASR	and then they hooked me up to um a herder herder and drew me up to uh method
61-1_169.781_4.37.wav_ASR	and um then it gets kind of like
61-1_174.309_2.62.wav_ASR	oh dear
61-1_178.661_5.2.wav_ASR	um i wasn't promoting much of anything
61-1_184.822_2.75.wav_ASR	and um they kept me overnight
61-1_188.082_10.52.wav_ASR	and the next day i walk up and i i i could s mostly talk but not very well
61-1_200.408_8.51.wav_ASR	and um i started having um all kinds of trouble
61-1_226.007_5.97.wav_ASR	well i took i i was in review four or five or five weeks
61-1_233.191_11.69.wav_ASR	and um i finally got to the point where i could almost i could you know um walk with my walker
61-1_245.707_15.99.wav_ASR	and i could d um here i could speak more terms and make uh you know help me do better
61-1_262.172_3.67.wav_ASR	um i didn't have any s move of my arm
61-1_266.267_3.84.wav_ASR	the l. c. d. screen
61-1_315.699_2.93.wav_ASR	and i did that for all a year
61-1_330.479_11.46.wav_ASR	um yeah i i would i would
61-1_349.383_4.85.wav_ASR	well she would help me with my um walking and my
61-1_356.687_5.12.wav_ASR	so um she worked one day a week with me on all balls
61-1_362.665_17.62.wav_ASR	and then um i had three um um successes that i did with my legs my arms so
61-1_380.9_21.52.wav_ASR	um as far as the b um as far as the i didn't do any more um s uh s oh speech mainly because the speech was gonna cost money
61-1_404.089_2.27.wav_ASR	and i don't have money
61-1_435.895_8.56.wav_ASR	and i went to um border for survey um for decision
61-1_445.985_13.32.wav_ASR	and i i felt really good about it because when i i was out i could um take care of people
61-1_461.683_4.17.wav_ASR	and i worked at um cambridge
61-1_467.67_6.41.wav_ASR	and i um we had a lot of people
61-1_474.883_17.85.wav_ASR	and we look them up with magnets and stuff um physical therapy and um just general s um flu and sickness and um things like that
61-1_494.709_2.1.wav_ASR	so i i really enjoyed that
61-1_518.553_7.98.wav_ASR	well uh a boy was playing
61-1_528.141_1.88.wav_ASR	um and he kick it
61-1_530.607_1.18.wav_ASR	and it hit the window
61-1_533.027_1.13.wav_ASR	and it came through
61-1_535.235_9.91.wav_ASR	and the guy was g got up and looked out the window to see what hi what um cost the problem
61-1_576.326_1.63.wav_ASR	but the mother says
61-1_578.502_0.9.wav_ASR	it's gotta range
61-1_580.406_8.01.wav_ASR	and i'm gonna give you um
61-1_588.979_0.31.wav_ASR	and he's
61-1_589.931_1.01.wav_ASR	now i don't want
61-1_592.076_3.31.wav_ASR	and so he walked and he walked
61-1_595.58_1.7.wav_ASR	and he was all dressed
61-1_598.168_0.88.wav_ASR	and you came
61-1_599.072_1.87.wav_ASR	and he was all dressed
61-1_601.589_1.22.wav_ASR	and his mom said
61-1_603.285_1.59.wav_ASR	you should have taken them bro
61-1_606.37_4.87.wav_ASR	and and so he talked the umbrella and carried it out in the rain
61-1_632.32_7.8.wav_ASR	well there was a a cat that was up in tree
61-1_640.874_3.84.wav_ASR	and so the guy got up there to try to help get the cat
61-1_645.588_4.39.wav_ASR	there was a girl underneath kind of um catch it
61-1_651.054_4.93.wav_ASR	and then they call for the um fair draw
61-1_656.707_2.71.wav_ASR	and the two guys with the larger cable
61-1_659.432_3.79.wav_ASR	um dog was kinda yep
61-1_663.272_13.78.wav_ASR	um um and then they would have helped them
61-1_678.744_4.75.wav_ASR	and they would have um gone back to the station
61-1_686.144_0.92.wav_ASR	is that what you want
61-1_919.524_12.68.wav_ASR	um was needed to take care of
61-1_932.962_5.86.wav_ASR	so these two um systems decided to take care of
61-1_939.695_14.76.wav_ASR	but they took and used her to find um make um their life easier by cooking and cleaning and s um all that stuff
61-1_955.23_28.59.wav_ASR	and then the um a m a mm to um allow them to go to the um allow them to uh to um allow them
61-1_984.421_9.68.wav_ASR	and um the the mother said no to the siren and um yes to the two curves
61-1_994.715_9.13.wav_ASR	and they got um a quick um
61-1_1003.869_16.48.wav_ASR	um and she was um re uh um re she would like to go but wasn't gonna be able
61-1_1094.545_5.59.wav_ASR	and she went ahead and went to the consol um the um thing
61-1_1100.159_2.85.wav_ASR	and and it was twelve dollars
61-1_1103.418_2.55.wav_ASR	and she was running out of s
61-1_1106.476_6.11.wav_ASR	and she dropped uh one or two uh s clips
61-1_1113.602_8.23.wav_ASR	and um then the um spongin was down
61-1_1121.847_4.94.wav_ASR	or uh that everybody was
61-1_1126.987_3.87.wav_ASR	oh she was uh all agag aggs
61-1_1131.671_11.07.wav_ASR	and then um the uh um guy came to try to fit on the shoe
61-1_1143.689_5.91.wav_ASR	and the the little girl or the girls
61-1_1150.328_4.82.wav_ASR	and um finally um they said
61-1_1155.34_1.2.wav_ASR	yeah what about a giraffe
61-1_1157.179_0.93.wav_ASR	and they put it on
61-1_1159.019_6.12.wav_ASR	and um she um
61-1_1166.031_13.87.wav_ASR	and they um she went uh uh married um the print
61-1_1183.039_1.84.wav_ASR	it's best i could do
61-1_1195.099_2.02.wav_ASR	or i would take the brad out
61-1_1198.866_11.06.wav_ASR	and i would get a um a platter and put on the plate
61-1_1210.828_7.54.wav_ASR	then i take a nice and um
61-1_1292.54_1.55.wav_ASR	and then i would take the gel
61-1_1296.163_5.41.wav_ASR	and i would take it and put it on the bread
61-1_1302.453_2.39.wav_ASR	and then i slap two pieces on the
61-1_1305.282_2.95.wav_ASR	and that's your bad your um
61-1_1310.138_1.54.wav_ASR	that's the way you do it
61-2_7.316_0.44.wav_ASR	there
61-2_10.544_1.21.wav_ASR	it's not great
61-2_11.806_1.61.wav_ASR	but it i it is fair
61-2_19.88_0.6.wav_ASR	yes
61-2_25.748_4.71.wav_ASR	well um the uh originally i was out
61-2_30.65_8.45.wav_ASR	um and i went uh into the um doctors
61-2_39.19_4.47.wav_ASR	and he got me at two s two thirty or something like that
61-2_44.66_3.26.wav_ASR	and um he asks me what i need
61-2_48.163_0.47.wav_ASR	uh i see
61-2_48.79_1.76.wav_ASR	like a um an email
61-2_51.378_7.99.wav_ASR	so he put me on an ambient s send me to um a household
61-2_60.401_2.05.wav_ASR	and i was fine
61-2_62.719_3.49.wav_ASR	and the but the um doctor said
61-2_66.37_3.15.wav_ASR	oh we'll keep you overnight make sure you're okay
61-2_69.795_0.84.wav_ASR	that's it
61-2_70.795_0.89.wav_ASR	okay that's fine
61-2_72.453_6.66.wav_ASR	um and then i went back to my room
61-2_79.135_2.28.wav_ASR	um and you know everything was fine
61-2_81.43_5.79.wav_ASR	and the next day um they got up and talked to me the doctor
61-2_87.64_5.56.wav_ASR	and the doctor was talking to me and um asked me what i had planned
61-2_93.216_0.6.wav_ASR	and i said
61-2_94.173_2.0.wav_ASR	or plain on the p. b. k.
61-2_97.054_1.66.wav_ASR	and he said
61-2_98.874_0.39.wav_ASR	okay
61-2_99.933_2.66.wav_ASR	well you're you're free to go
61-2_102.723_2.85.wav_ASR	and by that time i started
61-2_109.311_2.19.wav_ASR	and uh he goes
61-2_112.605_3.12.wav_ASR	okay
61-2_117.129_6.61.wav_ASR	and um then uh later i'm i um got up to p.
61-2_124.736_3.38.wav_ASR	and i stumbled and fell
61-2_129.151_0.991.wav_ASR	and then they took me
61-2_130.342_5.491.wav_ASR	and they took me um they took some more p pictures
61-2_136.632_14.78.wav_ASR	and they put me on a um flight and um fly me to sangeethi's vends
61-2_156.113_14.58.wav_ASR	it's it's uh no
61-2_173.308_2.5.wav_ASR	um and then they brought me in
61-2_176.256_7.46.wav_ASR	and s then um i kind of s was in and out in and out
61-2_184.691_2.92.wav_ASR	and um finally i went up
61-2_188.628_5.23.wav_ASR	and uh they told me they were gonna keep me for a couple days
61-2_193.939_3.48.wav_ASR	and then i'll put put me in and um internet
61-2_197.442_5.16.wav_ASR	and um they moved me to
61-2_205.991_4.68.wav_ASR	and they re have me for about no probably three bl uh three weeks
61-2_212.155_6.19.wav_ASR	um and i got better
61-2_218.937_4.47.wav_ASR	but you know i it's slow
61-2_224.256_0.67.wav_ASR	it's small
61-2_238.905_4.33.wav_ASR	well i started working
61-2_244.59_3.18.wav_ASR	and i kept walking a more and more all the time
61-2_248.655_2.36.wav_ASR	um i kinda talked
61-2_251.999_6.4.wav_ASR	but um and it would it got me s started on
61-2_259.233_4.67.wav_ASR	um i still w stumbled across the
61-2_265.159_2.74.wav_ASR	or i don't have them very well
61-2_268.961_4.7.wav_ASR	but um and i i've played the drums
61-2_276.752_6.1.wav_ASR	um and i i s i uh i constantly going over that
61-2_290.311_0.49.wav_ASR	oh no
61-2_312.631_20.68.wav_ASR	and i had it um a a um a baby um baby boy
61-2_334.79_5.55.wav_ASR	and he uh is twenty now or eighteen eighteen now
61-2_341.112_6.12.wav_ASR	um and uh and i watched him grow up
61-2_348.626_9.2.wav_ASR	and i mattered my future wife when he was um little
61-2_357.88_10.47.wav_ASR	and uh that's i i don't know
61-2_368.75_3.61.wav_ASR	that's about good to get
61-2_397.213_9.31.wav_ASR	um the guy was playing the volume bowl out side
61-2_407.038_1.3.wav_ASR	and it went through the window
61-2_408.392_4.23.wav_ASR	or and it pushed the entire screen
61-2_412.64_11.73.wav_ASR	um and then um i i this last one i don't have
61-2_489.721_0.57.wav_ASR	yeah
61-2_511.574_10.34.wav_ASR	so
61-2_529.275_8.57.wav_ASR	um and he's looking out the window with the ball trying to find out who s who sent it
61-2_562.372_1.88.wav_ASR	he is ready to go
61-2_564.954_17.9.wav_ASR	and she gives him um a um
61-2_590.232_0.92.wav_ASR	and he said
61-2_591.359_1.31.wav_ASR	oh i don't need it
61-2_592.693_2.57.wav_ASR	oh dear
61-2_595.285_4.08.wav_ASR	and it ran on him all the way to school
61-2_599.389_4.1.wav_ASR	or we got home he was all s red
61-2_604.479_2.94.wav_ASR	and she said
61-2_608.327_1.49.wav_ASR	maybe you'll take this
61-2_610.627_0.96.wav_ASR	and need to
61-2_633.612_8.38.wav_ASR	there's a scroll um so on our uh cards
61-2_643.054_2.25.wav_ASR	so she called for this man
61-2_645.321_1.57.wav_ASR	and he he would know
61-2_647.972_1.11.wav_ASR	and he couldn't get it
61-2_650.287_3.04.wav_ASR	and the dog was barking
61-2_655.342_10.2.wav_ASR	and so um the well he um dropped a uh ladder
61-2_667.92_4.85.wav_ASR	so they called the bu uh of our our idea
61-2_673.853_6.59.wav_ASR	and they came over to get the cat and the man out of the chair
61-2_682.078_3.83.wav_ASR	yeah and uh then they went back to the place
61-2_864.537_2.61.wav_ASR	cinetis was um by her self
61-2_867.296_11.2.wav_ASR	so he um they made the um step mother and daughters part of the family
61-2_879.336_3.01.wav_ASR	and they um talk c. d. l. and
61-2_882.705_22.8.wav_ASR	and they made her some their um put on dresses um take care of the little um the constant um um take care of the little um
61-2_916.856_1.52.wav_ASR	she takes care of the animal
61-2_919.802_13.32.wav_ASR	and then uh she was s slowly looking out over the um s the um place and seeing the s canvas and stuff
61-2_934.084_27.1.wav_ASR	and then um one day the sky came and was selling
61-2_962.47_9.66.wav_ASR	he was trying to get all the um girls to um sample uh for the um paul
61-2_973.421_21.39.wav_ASR	and um you know the um the uh step mom's for the two grams for the two dollars um flattery our uh dressers for the two guys
61-2_994.832_2.06.wav_ASR	and they got draw

61-2_1002.377_1.05.wav_ASR	oh but she could
61-2_1003.45_3.84.wav_ASR	um and she was kind of drap
61-2_1008.174_1.78.wav_ASR	um she was in our room
61-2_1010.688_16.29.wav_ASR	and this um steph morris came and got her
61-2_1027.539_0.319.wav_ASR	it's a
61-2_1028.31_1.759.wav_ASR	or i can dress you
61-2_1068.742_4.94.wav_ASR	and she danced with a um guy
61-2_1074.268_1.95.wav_ASR	and it was twelve and a half
61-2_1076.682_3.41.wav_ASR	and she knew she had to get it out of the everything
61-2_1080.573_3.49.wav_ASR	and she ran down my streets
61-2_1084.082_9.4.wav_ASR	and one of the s um splinters um landed on the star
61-2_1094.646_19.6.wav_ASR	and she um was all she was um
61-2_1122.02_9.76.wav_ASR	anyway um this guy brought this slider and tried it on and tried it on and tried it on
61-2_1131.881_2.15.wav_ASR	and they wouldn't take it
61-2_1134.685_2.0.wav_ASR	and um
61-2_1136.941_1.73.wav_ASR	is there anybody else here
61-2_1139.472_1.83.wav_ASR	and she said
61-2_1141.485_1.46.wav_ASR	yeah i'm here
61-2_1143.285_1.33.wav_ASR	and she came down
61-2_1144.667_2.04.wav_ASR	and she tried to s lap it up
61-2_1146.731_0.75.wav_ASR	and a chip
61-2_1148.031_1.74.wav_ASR	and they got
61-2_1155.391_0.75.wav_ASR	yeah it was bad
61-2_1168.88_15.37.wav_ASR	well i got the bread out the um sandwich uh and the gilly and the play doh and the play doh and the play doh
61-2_1185.951_26.34.wav_ASR	and i would um take out two slides of rubber and put them on the um the um thing
61-2_1212.967_21.03.wav_ASR	and then i would take and i would open up the um the um the um
61-2_1244.515_1.62.wav_ASR	oh
61-2_1246.458_8.04.wav_ASR	and i slap it down there and make it nice pl place
61-2_1255.095_4.45.wav_ASR	then i'd take and i'd opened the um gelat
61-2_1260.149_0.92.wav_ASR	like take it
61-2_1261.114_1.58.wav_ASR	you know slap it on
61-2_1262.716_24.17.wav_ASR	and then i would move um
61-2_1295.387_2.41.wav_ASR	and then i'd have a zombi
63-1_9.307_7.12.wav_ASR	both the time some time i i know it
63-1_18.203_0.77.wav_ASR	that's what it
63-1_19.278_6.63.wav_ASR	oh can't get it out at all i'm told i'm told what it is
63-1_25.929_1.77.wav_ASR	so then i get right to it
63-1_33.892_1.35.wav_ASR	alright
63-1_35.39_2.45.wav_ASR	yeah i yeah i got up
63-1_37.885_1.22.wav_ASR	or went to the bath
63-1_40.367_2.43.wav_ASR	and the next thing
63-1_42.974_1.5.wav_ASR	oh it was a nightmare at the time
63-1_45.174_9.36.wav_ASR	next thing i know i was in oh a thing in uh
63-1_54.991_2.02.wav_ASR	so i it's but
63-1_57.497_4.18.wav_ASR	uh uh it's a lot of things i never knew why
63-1_62.232_10.1.wav_ASR	uh i was i was in wood t i mean it in uh i don't know three two three week
63-1_72.348_8.15.wav_ASR	and then i was next time i was in uh in which part
63-1_80.927_1.09.wav_ASR	so i don't know
63-1_95.089_7.61.wav_ASR	well uh when i was in this one place
63-1_102.782_2.88.wav_ASR	uh what would it
63-1_105.685_4.02.wav_ASR	or uh i i can't remember
63-1_110.409_1.76.wav_ASR	but i did a lot of work on it
63-1_112.828_7.07.wav_ASR	had a lot of excuses other than uh weak
63-1_120.492_2.44.wav_ASR	are they they were doing something to me
63-1_123.701_2.83.wav_ASR	it's a lot harder to access side by side
63-1_148.618_8.52.wav_ASR	or i i other from uh you know get get married and oh i think the one of the best things i ever did
63-1_157.162_5.04.wav_ASR	it was uh about the t twenty or so
63-1_162.226_11.69.wav_ASR	or i mean well when i was in the air force i played a lot of ball and a lot of base uh tough ball
63-1_174.727_4.44.wav_ASR	and uh i had a a wonderful time doing that
63-1_179.46_1.02.wav_ASR	or a more advanced one
63-1_180.54_1.2.wav_ASR	al played base plate
63-1_182.282_1.16.wav_ASR	my played put ball
63-1_184.226_3.1.wav_ASR	but soft ball was by the same
63-1_187.349_4.87.wav_ASR	uh i i i learned a lot
63-1_192.234_2.13.wav_ASR	and i i got a lot from
63-1_194.426_2.4.wav_ASR	but it was a one of my best things
63-1_215.891_8.0.wav_ASR	he kick the ball
63-1_224.379_7.11.wav_ASR	you
63-1_231.786_1.23.wav_ASR	you went to the house
63-1_234.185_1.24.wav_ASR	the dags side
63-1_236.68_11.58.wav_ASR	and he won't give it back because of the because of the the ball being oh uh
63-1_249.3_1.41.wav_ASR	yeah
63-1_251.228_0.85.wav_ASR	it went to the heart
63-1_252.096_4.14.wav_ASR	or not over the table i mean the lamp
63-1_257.216_2.101.wav_ASR	and he's not gonna give it back
63-1_281.525_0.69.wav_ASR	okay
63-1_308.542_0.49.wav_ASR	okay
63-1_309.391_6.76.wav_ASR	uh the kid didn't wanna use the amber
63-1_316.275_1.26.wav_ASR	so he went out with
63-1_318.802_1.81.wav_ASR	and he got stuck in the wood
63-1_321.731_2.41.wav_ASR	so you went back
63-1_324.164_4.18.wav_ASR	um and his mother was really mad at
63-1_328.364_3.0.wav_ASR	um and so he's talk the underwear
63-1_333.482_4.93.wav_ASR	and then he uh when he got home he gave it to his mother
63-1_360.885_0.43.wav_ASR	okay
63-1_361.333_5.35.wav_ASR	oh do you want to just tell you right now
63-1_371.077_0.39.wav_ASR	okay
63-1_371.488_1.82.wav_ASR	uh uh i'm ready
63-1_373.954_9.02.wav_ASR	uh there's there's a there's a there's a ladder on the ground
63-1_382.989_5.11.wav_ASR	and and it was the use to catch a cat
63-1_388.361_1.55.wav_ASR	but it it was on the
63-1_390.248_1.3.wav_ASR	so i did
63-1_392.33_9.53.wav_ASR	and i need to take the dog up to the the boy so he could get
63-1_402.248_11.88.wav_ASR	he he was he was couldn't get up because the dog was growing on
63-1_414.71_2.09.wav_ASR	so i got some
63-1_416.822_3.82.wav_ASR	and and he got up there
63-1_421.431_4.55.wav_ASR	and on the way to the ground he's saw
63-1_425.998_2.87.wav_ASR	and and uh
63-1_965.553_24.44.wav_ASR	uh send rubber
63-1_990.015_24.73.wav_ASR	and uh they couldn't go to the s she couldn't go to the
63-1_1017.014_15.52.wav_ASR	but uh standard uh had a very good mood though who got her all dressed up and sent over to the b
63-1_1032.558_7.14.wav_ASR	all and at mid night she
63-1_1043.301_2.52.wav_ASR	go
63-1_1045.915_8.16.wav_ASR	or so everyone will be w wondering about it
63-1_1055.11_1.24.wav_ASR	but you only had
63-1_1056.449_6.94.wav_ASR	and then the call came and said he had the other side
63-1_1063.516_1.95.wav_ASR	or you ticked apart
63-1_1065.485_2.85.wav_ASR	and it was her sl
63-1_1069.277_5.73.wav_ASR	in the print lit uh and the print lit up happily ever after
63-1_1076.923_0.77.wav_ASR	don't think
63-1_1089.922_3.5.wav_ASR	ah i get
63-1_1094.826_14.33.wav_ASR	made i'd put a i'd put i'd put ch gelly on one slide and paint it on the other
63-1_1109.178_2.18.wav_ASR	or and i put it together
63-2_8.939_3.81.wav_ASR	um my speech is okay
63-2_12.805_5.82.wav_ASR	but l a lot of times i i know what it is but i can't say
63-2_20.929_0.67.wav_ASR	that's right
63-2_21.647_1.36.wav_ASR	but i know what it
63-2_23.054_4.5.wav_ASR	and until someone tells me what it is i just can't say it
63-2_27.999_0.71.wav_ASR	don't know why
63-2_28.733_2.26.wav_ASR	it's the way it is done
63-2_38.859_0.35.wav_ASR	yeah
63-2_44.303_3.08.wav_ASR	well i got up in the m uh in the morning
63-2_48.081_2.82.wav_ASR	and right away i i i w i wrote over
63-2_51.772_2.14.wav_ASR	sh she she was by my side
63-2_54.63_3.83.wav_ASR	and uh i told her i told a little quixy
63-2_59.076_3.32.wav_ASR	and chips
63-2_62.957_13.02.wav_ASR	so then i went to the bath room and i w i i'd i went to the bathroom and did my thing
63-2_76.575_5.33.wav_ASR	and then right after i did my thing something happen in here
63-2_83.156_2.36.wav_ASR	and uh i said
63-2_86.28_0.56.wav_ASR	oh no
63-2_87.247_4.1.wav_ASR	and that's the last thing i remember for week
63-2_110.622_8.52.wav_ASR	well the last thing i knew before my stroke hit was uh
63-2_119.546_6.29.wav_ASR	well after my stroke it uh i i went up
63-2_125.884_5.95.wav_ASR	but i was i remember th this was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it
63-2_131.943_3.96.wav_ASR	so the next thing i know how to back in
63-2_137.638_4.23.wav_ASR	and and i'm on a bad
63-2_141.886_3.02.wav_ASR	but my wife's there
63-2_145.895_8.26.wav_ASR	and uh and i slowly started talking to
63-2_154.83_6.86.wav_ASR	but i don't think i at at the per first thing i d oh don't think i made much sense to
63-2_161.771_2.36.wav_ASR	but she was always there for me
63-2_166.318_5.94.wav_ASR	so it it it you know it was okay 'cause i i could tell or anything i want
63-2_172.567_0.74.wav_ASR	she miss
63-2_174.287_2.43.wav_ASR	did or whatever she could
63-2_179.54_8.31.wav_ASR	and uh then after a while uh two or three uh numbers would come in every day
63-2_187.899_9.62.wav_ASR	and th they would do crazy things like leap my legs
63-2_197.735_3.12.wav_ASR	and e every day is different
63-2_200.878_1.4.wav_ASR	that would go down a whole
63-2_203.68_13.15.wav_ASR	and uh they would do uh log list l uh trying to get me s whatever
63-2_216.852_3.61.wav_ASR	and uh i i would do s do star
63-2_220.72_2.27.wav_ASR	or i remember that i just
63-2_223.735_6.54.wav_ASR	did a lot of uh i i don't know or
63-2_231.307_0.98.wav_ASR	yeah i don't know
63-2_232.337_1.88.wav_ASR	but we're we're always somebody there
63-2_234.266_4.36.wav_ASR	it's always i always somebody doing something to me
63-2_238.866_2.82.wav_ASR	lot of it i don't know anymore
63-2_241.734_6.07.wav_ASR	but it it was very for the first couple weeks i it was very extensible
63-2_270.707_16.25.wav_ASR	well the the the best thing i can remember before my stroke was getting matter over my stroke was getting angry of course
63-2_287.802_2.96.wav_ASR	and uh i was in the survey at the time
63-2_290.815_10.36.wav_ASR	but we we before but before i before i was of the price office i was also in the in the air force for twenty two years
63-2_302.963_14.46.wav_ASR	so um other from that i think the the thing that i i do the most about is in uh in uh in uh glass and green
63-2_318.711_10.5.wav_ASR	oh i w i was very interested in bash and phase ball and phase ball and especially s uh stuff
63-2_330.401_3.01.wav_ASR	had a lot of good memories about fruit bowl
63-2_335.59_16.4.wav_ASR	yeah i i was i was uh i'm not b below my own horror but i was the best player definitively on the team
63-2_352.759_1.93.wav_ASR	had a lot of input
63-2_356.795_1.32.wav_ASR	a lot of things happen
63-2_358.702_5.14.wav_ASR	but there's a l a lot of things
63-2_363.887_3.23.wav_ASR	oh th there's so much
63-2_367.253_10.28.wav_ASR	the fact you know uh there's so many things that good and bad
63-2_377.551_2.11.wav_ASR	uh i i can't do any of that
63-2_379.803_3.54.wav_ASR	it's a lot of my don't even remember any more
63-2_384.569_2.54.wav_ASR	they're either f rubber or what ever
63-2_387.736_1.31.wav_ASR	but that that's the way it
63-2_411.303_0.58.wav_ASR	okay
63-2_413.03_4.45.wav_ASR	uh there there was a bobby who kicked the ball
63-2_417.912_3.64.wav_ASR	and the ball went into a glass window
63-2_422.674_15.1.wav_ASR	and when it went into the window and it hit the guy on the on the stares and and knocked over the the wall
63-2_438.726_2.45.wav_ASR	and so sh he grabbed the lamp
63-2_442.108_7.4.wav_ASR	and he he told him he wasn't getting it back till the lamp was fixed
63-2_481.005_0.36.wav_ASR	okay
63-2_481.732_8.03.wav_ASR	ah first of all uh the boy did not want to take an umbrella
63-2_491.361_5.2.wav_ASR	he he s he s he said it was okay that she didn't have
63-2_497.241_6.7.wav_ASR	so she he walked out to the in the range and so that was the red
63-2_504.464_2.37.wav_ASR	so should he had to go back or
63-2_508.083_4.21.wav_ASR	and he was all dead now
63-2_512.317_9.689.wav_ASR	and so uh she had to uh she had to get her rubber
63-2_522.629_3.17.wav_ASR	if you put it uh in her hand
63-2_525.853_3.21.wav_ASR	but he went the scroll
63-2_544.992_0.48.wav_ASR	okay
63-2_557.835_3.71.wav_ASR	yeah um first of all i see a little giraffe
63-2_561.562_1.48.wav_ASR	or she's trying to get it
63-2_564.448_3.49.wav_ASR	but uh her her
63-2_568.152_0.97.wav_ASR	so if you could
63-2_569.138_10.13.wav_ASR	but so she uh she went to her father's father who could get it either 'cause the the lady was gone
63-2_579.979_9.18.wav_ASR	and he had a he had a real uh he had a dog
63-2_589.176_4.92.wav_ASR	and it and it had a t
63-2_594.116_4.12.wav_ASR	dog in the up up the tree kind of get
63-2_599.141_4.71.wav_ASR	and so because she couldn't
63-2_603.984_1.24.wav_ASR	and it should get the cake
63-2_606.497_1.25.wav_ASR	couldn't get the dog
63-2_608.377_9.35.wav_ASR	he went with the finder who got her out and got everything back to normal
63-2_1440.511_0.74.wav_ASR	okay
63-2_1441.268_16.0.wav_ASR	uh when the grand mother and their two grandsons were small they brought in the house
63-2_1458.806_6.78.wav_ASR	and uh s spongy oliver did all the work
63-2_1466.686_10.03.wav_ASR	and as kids got older there were more things for sinderella to do that they would
63-2_1478.756_14.77.wav_ASR	and finally they they got an invitation from the print that there was gonna be a galler at the at the printers panel
63-2_1495.182_6.21.wav_ASR	and uh they they told her she couldn't go 'cause she w she wasn't invited
63-2_1501.414_1.13.wav_ASR	yeah
63-2_1503.72_13.93.wav_ASR	so after they were gone uh the very godmother was showed up and and showed them how she could do
63-2_1518.63_15.49.wav_ASR	and so the first thing the favourite godmother did was turn all the mice and everything in to uh the care and the horror and the horror
63-2_1535.312_12.67.wav_ASR	and then uh
63-2_1549.523_20.5.wav_ASR	and then when she got to the when she got to the ball uh the the only thing
63-2_1571.01_3.63.wav_ASR	and uh they changed the right away
63-2_1575.707_4.89.wav_ASR	and then a twelve or a half she said she had to
63-2_1580.617_5.67.wav_ASR	going well she was going one of her splinters was left on the ground
63-2_1586.306_15.28.wav_ASR	so when she got home sinderie uh was back on her and her sh and her shabba clothes and her dog's and her cat's and her
63-2_1601.634_26.69.wav_ASR	and uh the the the show well it was supposed to be broken by by the um by the the show
63-2_1629.078_3.66.wav_ASR	but they they it was
63-2_1632.753_6.42.wav_ASR	and so and so and so and
63-2_1639.194_4.61.wav_ASR	two and it was ex exactly
63-2_1644.445_0.98.wav_ASR	for sure
63-2_1646.792_3.37.wav_ASR	and so er a print got me
63-2_1650.177_1.77.wav_ASR	and they lit up happily ever after
63-2_1666.397_8.74.wav_ASR	you put it you put on one once you put two s slides of the grid together
63-2_1675.69_2.37.wav_ASR	one would pe p. d. b. battery and one would
63-2_1678.161_2.74.wav_ASR	alrighty and you get them together
63-2_1680.917_3.87.wav_ASR	other you got it's thinner battery yellow
65-1_9.517_0.96.wav_ASR	it needs to be accurate
65-1_28.81_2.53.wav_ASR	the eighty four percent of the last kind of memory is five days before
65-1_35.471_0.49.wav_ASR	alrighty
65-1_36.531_2.9.wav_ASR	they happen on a Thursday martine three four
65-1_40.334_5.76.wav_ASR	my remember we are at some friends' houses or having super the previous Saturday night
65-1_46.238_15.54.wav_ASR	and i remember nothing after that until until until i see you and started r starting things slowly about uh three days after i've moved out of move out of i. c. u.
65-1_63.223_3.95.wav_ASR	um i the eight nine t. i. d. uh
65-1_67.496_0.83.wav_ASR	see the
65-1_69.041_4.34.wav_ASR	uh was crossing ten street in annapolis
65-1_74.421_2.67.wav_ASR	and i remember crossing in the product cross word
65-1_77.109_7.56.wav_ASR	crossing with the light and seeing going up close to the core panel on the core going from west to east
65-1_86.021_1.74.wav_ASR	and then i have the sensitivity being spongy
65-1_87.783_6.82.wav_ASR	that's that's that's that i remember think from last summer i remember forty twenty minutes or so
65-1_104.608_1.57.wav_ASR	or
65-1_107.092_0.66.wav_ASR	it's
65-1_107.8_10.32.wav_ASR	it was very that was very troublesome uh because uh really troubling because um didn't know where i was
65-1_119.162_6.17.wav_ASR	and there were visitors in the a household room in the in my household room
65-1_125.543_3.84.wav_ASR	and these guys were saying
65-1_129.431_3.17.wav_ASR	and i knew who they were new the new s these people
65-1_132.616_1.52.wav_ASR	but there's a lot lots of them there
65-1_134.184_1.5.wav_ASR	you don't know where i was
65-1_136.291_2.12.wav_ASR	there were lots of pe there were several people visiting me
65-1_138.802_1.63.wav_ASR	and and the several mass
65-1_141.127_1.76.wav_ASR	when when it's his voice gonna come back
65-1_143.169_1.03.wav_ASR	when is voice gonna come back
65-1_145.808_1.58.wav_ASR	oh i don't know if it's perfect
65-1_148.727_11.07.wav_ASR	uh and but what i didn't know uh was that the i'd spent ten days with a being tune down my throat uh in a k in a go
65-1_160.403_2.47.wav_ASR	and and look like it was gonna come out again
65-1_162.888_1.7.wav_ASR	and i gave you a trigonometry
65-1_165.547_13.33.wav_ASR	uh and uh and so the the s what turned out to be a scroller and vogue colours uh changed my voice pretty radically where where my wife had had to hold me
65-1_178.901_7.83.wav_ASR	so she said she said that the uh s said that you you you had it
65-1_190.21_0.31.wav_ASR	so
65-1_190.701_1.11.wav_ASR	actually there there was
65-1_191.914_1.46.wav_ASR	it's a one that's a good idea
65-1_193.584_0.55.wav_ASR	and that would go
65-1_194.184_7.67.wav_ASR	it's it's so but that was it was extra long a trouble because i d i actually didn't know where i was
65-1_202.556_3.45.wav_ASR	when people are recogniser it's it recogniser it's the same
65-1_206.835_1.36.wav_ASR	when it when it's gonna come back
65-1_208.855_1.99.wav_ASR	and it was r really really troublesome
65-1_211.097_0.7.wav_ASR	really trouble
65-1_214.441_2.34.wav_ASR	that was that was one of the first um
65-1_227.068_4.71.wav_ASR	well it's what what in a
65-1_232.093_9.72.wav_ASR	and terms of my brain injury if you will uh certain things kind of standing out and we're extremely dulling
65-1_242.008_14.18.wav_ASR	um and it just when when i happen to get feedback on something i didn't particularly understand or or or improve of i got it uh it didn't show
65-1_256.236_2.98.wav_ASR	it was it was ex extraordinaryanger
65-1_261.478_2.001.wav_ASR	and it never did like they never did lunch out
65-1_264.808_2.63.wav_ASR	um but just re really angry
65-1_267.486_1.47.wav_ASR	and i cap it on top
65-1_268.978_5.53.wav_ASR	it was very very very troublesome really troublesome for a l a low for for quite a while
65-1_291.425_2.81.wav_ASR	and and and i don't want you ever to relate to that
65-1_294.408_3.91.wav_ASR	oh i wouldn't i wouldn't waste that
65-1_316.655_7.65.wav_ASR	the almost no uh ninety nine is almost a
65-1_324.396_0.55.wav_ASR	again
65-1_325.376_0.84.wav_ASR	yeah
65-1_326.232_3.43.wav_ASR	it's like just a just a just a re rubber but not near not nearly as serious
65-1_330.55_12.55.wav_ASR	but the the eighty four percent was uh was was most interesting because because uh uh an engineer for my in the company for my uh
65-1_343.181_6.64.wav_ASR	but i was on what they call the high pops or high pitched loudness i had a wonderful clear head of it
65-1_349.842_1.58.wav_ASR	you was gonna go for our own origin
65-1_352.182_4.66.wav_ASR	and and uh and my one of my superheroes told me
65-1_356.862_0.89.wav_ASR	he was supposed to do
65-1_357.802_6.2.wav_ASR	tell me told me i was i was on the high power list which meant again and i i was going far
65-1_364.136_1.18.wav_ASR	my colour's lighted in front of it
65-1_366.048_2.15.wav_ASR	uh there was there was nothing sharp
65-1_369.12_8.58.wav_ASR	and then uh after the eighty four internet uh personal change which i find out twenty years later is embedded
65-1_377.717_1.63.wav_ASR	would i find out a twenty euros
65-1_380.151_3.17.wav_ASR	uh and the uh and by sound dead
65-1_384.141_2.67.wav_ASR	uh i was slow to complete thing
65-1_387.869_5.87.wav_ASR	uh but finally did after taking taking more time for contenting thing
65-1_393.757_7.06.wav_ASR	and and uh and and i couldn't do my engineering job to to to the software
65-1_401.669_1.51.wav_ASR	and i didn't tell anybody that
65-1_403.668_0.89.wav_ASR	didn't find anybody
65-1_404.612_0.8.wav_ASR	drag it
65-1_406.295_17.87.wav_ASR	and spent it and spent my lunch hours for months clu uh sh uh by myself in a in a coffee room uh re learning aspects of my job and not telling i'm not telling a school because i just n
65-1_424.226_1.26.wav_ASR	it's before before a. d. a.
65-1_426.413_1.47.wav_ASR	nei ninety four again
65-1_428.188_2.09.wav_ASR	actually before the materials of the delivery
65-1_430.428_0.54.wav_ASR	thirty yeah
65-1_432.046_2.46.wav_ASR	and and i was on on the actual
65-1_434.528_1.11.wav_ASR	we don't want company business
65-1_436.8_5.82.wav_ASR	and i knew i d i just knew that that uh might be able to compete at a base aspect of my job
65-1_443.288_1.95.wav_ASR	actually i just knew i was gonna get fired
65-1_445.562_0.85.wav_ASR	and knew i would
65-1_447.165_8.14.wav_ASR	had three kids a white a a a just a lo lovely lovely luffy one uh they're at home with the three kids
65-1_455.32_2.19.wav_ASR	and i was the i was the
65-1_458.431_2.45.wav_ASR	and i couldn't i couldn't stand the thought of being fired
65-1_461.855_5.49.wav_ASR	uh and and so i'd like to say i'd say
65-1_467.981_7.74.wav_ASR	and it took me probably couple three years to figure out that that uh i was no longer on on the fast track
65-1_476.146_1.08.wav_ASR	and no no no
65-1_477.247_2.36.wav_ASR	it was it wasn't it wasn't obvious
65-1_479.684_3.22.wav_ASR	but i it was no longer a fashion target
65-1_482.928_9.4.wav_ASR	and uh and the biggest most difficult part of that was the was the shortest methodologies
65-1_493.261_11.8.wav_ASR	uh and so uh i ended up with a uh frank and panter and would write down everything in there just to help my help my short term memory and would write down every thing in there just to help my help my short term memory
65-1_506.11_10.319.wav_ASR	uh so it was it was uh uh largely the the um the the a. v. and and people seeing me definitely at work
65-1_516.482_4.701.wav_ASR	and and of course i'll of course i'll look at back look back
65-1_521.2_2.859.wav_ASR	and and i did not discover it
65-1_524.107_3.97.wav_ASR	yeah well y it w it was perfectly obvious every body around me
65-1_528.092_0.72.wav_ASR	but
65-1_530.176_14.41.wav_ASR	um and that the uh writing everything down was was uh the biggest uh s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s
65-1_567.07_6.54.wav_ASR	the the the
65-1_573.891_4.62.wav_ASR	uh i i call it pre eighty four percent
65-1_579.419_5.17.wav_ASR	uh that's that's how my my life has been defined
65-1_585.51_11.37.wav_ASR	uh and i it's i just got um that that that is that is what i my defining moment
65-1_597.64_8.89.wav_ASR	because i've struggled with the the fava uh obviously and memory issues uh ever since then
65-1_606.552_13.22.wav_ASR	and and uh and i and uh i mean like for example uh the the um the writer of seventy six seven percent was out of energy goal
65-1_619.826_1.84.wav_ASR	uh and a jog in the napoleon
65-1_621.855_7.67.wav_ASR	and so yeah the e. g. is ergonomic viability i'd i'd i'd rated my phones in the in the house
65-1_630.113_6.18.wav_ASR	and that way my dad and i put the uh put the l. c. d. v. in a separate wall
65-1_637.015_3.44.wav_ASR	uh and uh it was quite a interesting interesting project
65-1_641.315_4.08.wav_ASR	and and and interesting enough i can probably
65-1_645.41_8.3.wav_ASR	the the the engineer had a remote charger four g. c. c. keyboard on it which had some difficulties
65-1_653.791_1.8.wav_ASR	and i could probably still today
65-1_655.869_1.58.wav_ASR	oh that's right
65-1_658.288_2.76.wav_ASR	like probably still they'll rebuild the carbohydrate blind fold but
65-1_662.6_3.89.wav_ASR	yeah but but but i'd ask you what i had for super last night
65-1_667.122_0.49.wav_ASR	can't
65-1_669.274_0.66.wav_ASR	so yeah
65-1_670.235_1.4.wav_ASR	short short term memory
65-1_671.658_13.02.wav_ASR	but uh but then things from from from longer ago and uh do uh do uh some something longer ago
65-1_695.671_5.07.wav_ASR	oh no actually i was uh i would've ended up actually
65-1_701.591_4.64.wav_ASR	uh and and i got out of school the spring of seventy six
65-1_706.317_1.95.wav_ASR	the job
65-1_709.739_0.87.wav_ASR	yeah they're in an apple
65-1_710.687_2.65.wav_ASR	and a switch or s switch or no longer exists
65-1_714.262_5.09.wav_ASR	but uh i was an engineering at that
65-1_720.011_10.31.wav_ASR	and so w so i i my my customers for we'll we'll call it or uh four light draw folder
65-1_731.149_9.58.wav_ASR	uh uh a f a a one of the small four per cents i had a a calculator
65-1_745.046_7.51.wav_ASR	um and the uh uh strawberry a. b. f. eighty five curves that were all my colour kind of customer
65-1_753.154_4.14.wav_ASR	so i was already doing that kind of stuff as my as a as a job
65-1_758.166_6.91.wav_ASR	but then uh my my father found this uh this article on the internet or the sheltered veggie
65-1_765.797_12.68.wav_ASR	uh and it just happened to be that it was a project for h. n. i d uh the built together that were uh well uh while uh while i was working the automated instruments feed
65-1_778.497_8.96.wav_ASR	and and uh it's kinda it's kinda how i got kind of how i got how i got how i got how i got how i got how i got how i got how i got how i got how i got how i got how i got how i got how i got how i got how i got how i got how i got how i got how i got how i got how i got how i got how i got how i got how i got how i got how i got how i got how i got how i got how i got how i got how i got how i got how i got how i got how i got how i got how i got how i got how i got how i got how i got how i got how i got how i got how i got how i got how i got how i got how i got how i got how i got how i got how i got how i got how i got how i got how i got how i got how i got
65-1_815.779_2.14.wav_ASR	oh it was it was a real it was a real
65-1_818.492_4.39.wav_ASR	making that uh the the the hard core at the time was the the dashboard and the t. v. screen
65-1_823.884_3.99.wav_ASR	uh it would be the first
65-1_828.597_6.2.wav_ASR	uh yeah and then uh he used it for the stop light test those guys off
65-1_835.141_6.83.wav_ASR	and they could d and there's the other guys the the other guys could figure out how the l. c. d. screen works
65-1_842.229_5.21.wav_ASR	it was it was it was a lot of fun seeing it in my faces as a
65-1_910.099_1.2.wav_ASR	oh okay
65-1_911.875_2.36.wav_ASR	the s storage is there's a a a a young lad
65-1_914.589_8.46.wav_ASR	looks like uh uh maybe maybe it's a x. grey or silver grey
65-1_923.492_6.72.wav_ASR	and then an error kicks it puts a square ball through a through a a house of wine
65-1_930.915_8.97.wav_ASR	and the circuit board comes to the house and and lands on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on
65-1_940.813_7.32.wav_ASR	and the old mail box gets up holding the stack of paper and looks to the through the window and says trying to figure out what's going on
65-1_951.714_0.38.wav_ASR	yeah
65-1_971.063_5.65.wav_ASR	uh looks like a a a young a young boy is leading
65-1_976.736_2.88.wav_ASR	and as as i said with my mother so
65-1_979.897_1.4.wav_ASR	it here's there's your umbrella
65-1_981.983_0.84.wav_ASR	uh
65-1_983.049_1.03.wav_ASR	yeah i don't need that
65-1_984.13_4.77.wav_ASR	uh and then send the e. e. d. leaves saying goodbye and everything
65-1_989.831_1.61.wav_ASR	and the remote holding the amber
65-1_991.969_3.23.wav_ASR	and uh the the young lad is out and about walking around
65-1_995.914_1.2.wav_ASR	and it starts to rain
65-1_997.78_1.36.wav_ASR	yeah it's a shared agreement
65-1_999.75_0.79.wav_ASR	and he is running
65-1_1000.563_4.18.wav_ASR	and it gets back to his to his mom so soothing wait
65-1_1005.358_0.87.wav_ASR	and he's not happy
65-1_1006.245_1.13.wav_ASR	you know
65-1_1008.212_2.37.wav_ASR	and then he goes out kind of with it
65-1_1010.631_3.09.wav_ASR	and and and uh it looks like all is
65-1_1027.309_5.9.wav_ASR	well the beginning looks like a cat a pet cat they cleaned up a tree
65-1_1034.269_3.46.wav_ASR	uh and being probably changed by a dog come up a treat
65-1_1038.222_1.16.wav_ASR	got stuck up on the tree
65-1_1040.013_8.761.wav_ASR	uh a little girl who was probably her mother uh drew her over there in their cradle uh and then it goes to cat down
65-1_1049.333_10.48.wav_ASR	and looks like a a double mirror figure most likely their dead they cleaned up the tree and it's and it's and it's got to go up the tree by this barking dog
65-1_1060.56_5.52.wav_ASR	also and now then there's also a a a bigger uh over the other side of the screen
65-1_1066.533_11.02.wav_ASR	and it's also the local finder is showing up with their laptop the trying to get down both the the cat and the and the and the mail the the the the male figure
65-1_1077.577_2.22.wav_ASR	that's that's that's that's
65-1_1353.355_0.3.wav_ASR	you think
65-1_1353.835_5.45.wav_ASR	cinara uh was uh her mother passed away
65-1_1360.127_2.77.wav_ASR	uh father uh remarried
65-1_1363.72_8.84.wav_ASR	and uh i d it's the the wooden stepmother and that brought with her two two rather mean spirited daughters
65-1_1373.655_13.75.wav_ASR	uh and they and in their in their whole life um the yeah uh and in their in their whole life by the steph mothers and audios how we say by the by the steph daughters
65-1_1387.769_7.59.wav_ASR	uh uh and uh um and just uh just uh just uh just uh just uh just uh just uh just uh just uh just uh just uh just uh just uh just uh just uh just uh just uh just uh just uh just uh just uh just uh just uh just uh just uh just uh just uh just uh just uh just uh just uh just uh just uh just uh just uh just uh just uh just uh just uh just uh just uh just uh just uh just uh just uh just uh just uh just uh just uh just uh just uh just uh just uh just uh just uh just uh just uh just
65-1_1395.968_9.9.wav_ASR	um and then uh and then the in the kingdom the king had a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
65-1_1406.524_19.39.wav_ASR	and one of the innovativeness um s s i would want to with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the with the
65-1_1427.134_24.41.wav_ASR	um and the and so the sender uh with the help of the um the in the in the and the in the house uh they're they're not in the in the and the in the house
65-1_1451.694_17.08.wav_ASR	and so would not allow on getting one of her her her daughters married off uh and then so would not allow it to go to the ball
65-1_1469.504_3.98.wav_ASR	uh uh her uh step sisters went
65-1_1474.182_11.98.wav_ASR	and uh and a and a carrier would look like a a pump and then mice went up but uh turned into the horses
65-1_1486.874_8.89.wav_ASR	and i think that the the the the the the of the of the of the of the the of the of the the of the the of the of the of the the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the
65-1_1496.594_3.35.wav_ASR	and uh
65-1_1499.966_5.76.wav_ASR	also um the the the print uh designed right away with a centred
65-1_1506.4_12.64.wav_ASR	and but the specification oh from the uh from the o. s. v. file format was he had to back by the way it was at the end of the big night because everything was gonna go back to the way it was in the mid
65-1_1519.217_1.04.wav_ASR	so yeah
65-1_1520.273_3.71.wav_ASR	lie so she heard about a and left a glass lid behind
65-1_1524.602_11.17.wav_ASR	uh and then uh and then after the the the the print said there's only one person interested in
65-1_1535.789_2.93.wav_ASR	yeah it was the the gap that left the left the gap between
65-1_1538.769_9.72.wav_ASR	and and so the the the device were set throughout the kingdom to try and figure out who was that uh later you left the glass up behind
65-1_1549.451_11.43.wav_ASR	uh and and it was the w it was the one it was uh this small very small glass
65-1_1561.723_3.47.wav_ASR	and uh the steph sister
65-1_1565.701_3.72.wav_ASR	cinetis would fit in the lapel
65-1_1569.443_7.35.wav_ASR	and so she was identified as the one that the that the press uh uh wanted to want to
65-1_1576.915_5.67.wav_ASR	and so th so then the uh
65-1_1582.609_2.0.wav_ASR	they all lit up they they lit up anyway
65-1_1595.381_4.76.wav_ASR	oh prefer prefer uh on on the web grid
65-1_1600.8_8.05.wav_ASR	you would use a nice and and uh get uh it spreads the spread the pen on the one side of the red
65-1_1609.79_6.11.wav_ASR	oh but then the other other side of the b other other other grid the optional jolly is great
65-1_1617.339_1.5.wav_ASR	and then you take a spoon
65-1_1619.081_5.76.wav_ASR	now not nice because you you get up you get up the the the the the the the
65-1_1624.893_6.9.wav_ASR	but you take your screen and and store it on the other piece of glass on the other piece of glass
65-1_1632.163_2.41.wav_ASR	use that s use the white to split it out
65-1_1634.597_2.32.wav_ASR	then then put the two aspects together
65-1_1636.935_3.5.wav_ASR	and you got the ultimate the ultimate
65-2_8.167_1.85.wav_ASR	speaks
65-2_10.563_0.77.wav_ASR	much improved
65-2_12.338_9.08.wav_ASR	the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the
65-2_22.185_23.08.wav_ASR	um the what what happens is that the uh um if i have an acquisition to tell a story or something like that i will may do it then the and the most base form and and and think later
65-2_45.514_1.3.wav_ASR	sh i should have said it
65-2_46.935_0.67.wav_ASR	you coulda said that
65-2_48.111_1.09.wav_ASR	why why didn't i say
65-2_49.95_6.53.wav_ASR	uh for example in the tropical shooting of the audio electronics uh there's some b could definitely with a card
65-2_57.16_5.08.wav_ASR	uh it helps almost if i think about it for a bit of a day or so
65-2_62.323_26.47.wav_ASR	and li and less i've seen it before uh the the the opposite of time spending and thinking about it and considering all the different aspects
65-2_89.557_8.62.wav_ASR	and uh yeah it is uh oh i'll i'll i'll i'll get a head set on the idea
65-2_98.79_1.57.wav_ASR	why didn't why didn't i think of that before
65-2_100.765_5.64.wav_ASR	oh i i before before my eighty four action i woulda thought of that
65-2_107.061_5.26.wav_ASR	but uh it's much more difficult and and uh takes a longer than it does
65-2_112.37_1.84.wav_ASR	that's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's
65-2_114.233_1.4.wav_ASR	you mean that way for thirty six years
65-2_127.18_6.21.wav_ASR	um the first one was a where i was team blog at an interaction
65-2_134.294_2.7.wav_ASR	uh and uh and uh
65-2_137.011_6.39.wav_ASR	okay i got the uh yeah a old electronic hardware setup in the drawer side door
65-2_144.01_12.54.wav_ASR	and uh had a shared pen volume group hit five broken giraffe uh a a base scroll drawer uh rubber's plain turn double curved uh rubber's plain
65-2_157.19_1.61.wav_ASR	did i say spongy long
65-2_159.526_1.7.wav_ASR	uh seventy euros is a good
65-2_161.937_1.51.wav_ASR	uh th three and a half
65-2_164.72_6.62.wav_ASR	and uh and uh i uh and the code for three and a half weeks
65-2_172.132_7.28.wav_ASR	um honest probably probably about two and a half months
65-2_180.19_6.53.wav_ASR	and our third child was born uh three days after i was uh moved out of i. c. u.
65-2_190.003_8.12.wav_ASR	and the second one uh was uh favourite ninety nine i'd hit by colour wall across uh trend street in napele
65-2_199.113_2.48.wav_ASR	it was a shared t. v. and a fiddle on the left side
65-2_202.563_6.32.wav_ASR	uh and and i believe that i was uncorrect for
65-2_209.678_1.66.wav_ASR	well i guess i don't know how long
65-2_212.237_10.04.wav_ASR	but uh um i recall walking across the street starting across the street and seeing the cordable panel of the card
65-2_223.056_2.51.wav_ASR	and then i have the s the sensing being spun around
65-2_226.386_7.17.wav_ASR	and then and then uh later like i said i'd i'd first sort of remember things maybe
65-2_234.386_0.46.wav_ASR	don't know
65-2_234.865_0.96.wav_ASR	twenty minutes later
65-2_236.459_2.59.wav_ASR	and and i i was i was a great mistake
65-2_239.878_5.52.wav_ASR	oh it was in a wonderful mood because the f eighty four accent the last time i remember is five days before the accident
65-2_246.349_7.14.wav_ASR	and uh uh and this one uh f mara uh february ninety nine i know exactly where i was when i was doing what i was doing
65-2_254.174_2.51.wav_ASR	and i was i was i was in a really great room
65-2_257.551_13.19.wav_ASR	and then i say a a a green energy because uh uh think it was about to one day or two days later
65-2_271.809_19.88.wav_ASR	uh and uh i'd that was that was the most expensive part uh in the in the log from from that they uh no knowing if the double vision would ever go away was uh a most concerning if you
65-2_292.55_3.94.wav_ASR	um it did finally go away when the brain's scrolling went down
65-2_296.863_0.66.wav_ASR	finally we go
65-2_297.627_3.16.wav_ASR	but i don't i don't it's three four or five
65-2_303.117_1.68.wav_ASR	the last they're secretive about time
65-2_305.602_7.65.wav_ASR	uh and and the doctors could not tell me whether the television would ever would ever go away
65-2_313.306_5.33.wav_ASR	it was a more or less a palm like
65-2_318.652_8.33.wav_ASR	and then um i recall that the overhead guy that stuck a pen on my in my in my t. v. and my my t. v. said
65-2_327.006_12.71.wav_ASR	oh uh oh uh after after three or four months when the when the all the the fishers and the uh and the t. v. be started to heal he said
65-2_340.67_4.18.wav_ASR	oh yeah you know that's probably the most important ingredient known to man
65-2_345.576_0.85.wav_ASR	oh okay
65-2_346.527_1.96.wav_ASR	yeah well it's just me being a big baby then right
65-2_349.558_1.88.wav_ASR	yeah
65-2_353.552_2.83.wav_ASR	that's kind of a
65-2_356.478_4.01.wav_ASR	that those are the two actions in in it and uh at a t at a t at a top level
65-2_372.985_7.65.wav_ASR	oh worst trend going into a waste a trend and ten and ten
65-2_399.4_12.1.wav_ASR	uh the uh um after the first e. d. f. internet uh when i did not know
65-2_411.553_17.22.wav_ASR	uh what what happened was that the eighty four uh laptops were first adopted if you if you feel by by my by the company
65-2_429.508_17.32.wav_ASR	and uh um and uh uh my my boss at that time um
65-2_447.04_0.75.wav_ASR	oh cool it's a
65-2_449.397_1.27.wav_ASR	we'll say we should play with
65-2_450.939_2.51.wav_ASR	but uh learn how to use their their at home
65-2_454.232_6.24.wav_ASR	and of course this is before the this is before the web eighty four uh and and and those kind of things
65-2_460.758_11.03.wav_ASR	uh i'd been doing uh uh nasta and which is nassar and which is nasa structural analysis uh for quite a long time
65-2_472.499_9.05.wav_ASR	and uh but that was all that was all on the i. b. m. a. push cards that kind of stuff uh or or a main or a or a desk top computer
65-2_482.344_4.62.wav_ASR	um and uh and so here's just a a simple little laptop
65-2_486.979_1.14.wav_ASR	alrighty no i don't have to use it
65-2_488.329_4.44.wav_ASR	and so they brought this uh my my boss brought his laptop here
65-2_492.784_4.6.wav_ASR	yeah and in those years there was a a user manual we came along with
65-2_498.448_4.81.wav_ASR	uh and so tried to use a a computer a op uh computer user manual
65-2_503.994_7.47.wav_ASR	uh if you have red uh if you have red a microphone of any kind they are extremely difficult
65-2_512.342_14.661.wav_ASR	and uh one of one thing in particular which uh uh well it was was problematic when the in the in the in the and the manager uh was i dunno to select something
65-2_528.184_0.51.wav_ASR	select
65-2_528.839_12.43.wav_ASR	well have never had any training in in a a in a laptop uh or microphone uh what what what did select me
65-2_542.262_6.07.wav_ASR	and and after several days of trying to figure out what's correct meet
65-2_548.888_1.04.wav_ASR	yeah that will happen
65-2_550.399_0.6.wav_ASR	so like me
65-2_551.438_0.49.wav_ASR	oh fine
65-2_552.509_5.58.wav_ASR	their slogan might uh what what they meant by select i couldn't figure it
65-2_558.551_0.56.wav_ASR	it could
65-2_559.312_1.04.wav_ASR	there are no way
65-2_560.944_2.31.wav_ASR	and it's altogether trouble really trouble by
65-2_564.422_5.97.wav_ASR	and so so finally i called a coffee and uh
65-2_570.608_3.88.wav_ASR	but what what did they what did they mean when they say silence
65-2_575.568_7.44.wav_ASR	and it described the head tape and moving the cursor and moving the cursor along the corner and zooming in and out
65-2_583.899_1.23.wav_ASR	that's what they made by silence
65-2_585.777_2.95.wav_ASR	well hell that was never described in the manual
65-2_589.857_3.86.wav_ASR	and that that really that through me for a look
65-2_594.838_7.3.wav_ASR	and so i i ca because uh very quashing as to whether whether i would could go back to work even function at work
65-2_603.43_5.21.wav_ASR	um and and so finally the the they could say the the chip from the code word
65-2_609.025_0.57.wav_ASR	oh okay
65-2_609.645_8.98.wav_ASR	but it was most s basic of terms which the the um uh dash manual
65-2_619.047_2.1.wav_ASR	oh no that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's
65-2_621.166_1.3.wav_ASR	it's before microphone object
65-2_623.365_14.01.wav_ASR	as a dog's mane it did not it did not uh uh contribute to s somebody would would have the it would have the the colour of silver enough and therefore enough
65-2_638.605_1.01.wav_ASR	they did not
65-2_640.35_2.3.wav_ASR	the cost manager did not describe that anyway
65-2_643.738_14.19.wav_ASR	and so so the and uh so i went back to work and uh um struggling with the interface and the um trying to uh to function
65-2_658.457_15.64.wav_ASR	and and finally uh i after a couple of years i'd have to uh what do you call the french panner and and uh said
65-2_675.07_5.2.wav_ASR	you might might have it take the f take the refrigerator and then write stuff down
65-2_681.229_2.47.wav_ASR	and so well that w that was a good s
65-2_684.72_2.15.wav_ASR	you mean just being able to the right right thing down
65-2_686.892_1.67.wav_ASR	so i got a small
65-2_689.233_0.96.wav_ASR	yeah but they're right now
65-2_690.968_8.11.wav_ASR	still i care it's small small n uh no no no no
65-2_699.671_10.58.wav_ASR	guess that that was that was writing what i forgot
65-2_710.85_7.47.wav_ASR	all the magic that was uh that that was uh um a n n a new l. c. d. on life if you
65-2_719.266_2.66.wav_ASR	um
65-2_721.95_17.32.wav_ASR	and and and so i ended up uh as a labour as a um a content manager for the company uh in the different products meeting all kind of people
65-2_739.905_10.88.wav_ASR	uh i developed uh uh tricks where i when i meet somebody new i will always say their name over and over again silently to myself
65-2_751.358_5.4.wav_ASR	used their name in any kind of rubber rubber construction with them
65-2_757.276_2.99.wav_ASR	use your name your name every time first your last name or or both
65-2_760.315_4.68.wav_ASR	and and then uh after the after the the correction to write their name down
65-2_766.354_8.45.wav_ASR	uh and and and that that's been uh that's that's a a volatile trigger that i that i still use today
65-2_775.921_2.94.wav_ASR	for example i'd matthew but uh in our neighbouring matthew
65-2_779.492_1.18.wav_ASR	yeah but i'm i'm a home now
65-2_781.203_0.98.wav_ASR	now down the form
65-2_782.926_11.55.wav_ASR	uh met a half an hour and then the in the uh neighbourhood out of the war of several days ago and and uh moved to the neighbouring some time back
65-2_794.526_1.25.wav_ASR	oh i got a new one
65-2_795.797_6.87.wav_ASR	and sort of said it's name over and over again and the like and told my wife about it and then uh then wrote it down
65-2_803.378_7.6.wav_ASR	and uh this morning i was i saw him over for a walk and and couldn't record his name at first but then i thought for a while
65-2_810.996_1.51.wav_ASR	and then finally final
65-2_813.742_14.39.wav_ASR	so but but the the disadvantage on on um recording names is quite has been quite a quite an in available tool and help uh i'll get me current to functionality
65-2_839.375_0.52.wav_ASR	yes
65-2_840.697_4.78.wav_ASR	the uh um i think i'm the last week
65-2_846.085_1.32.wav_ASR	maybe
65-2_847.746_4.92.wav_ASR	time i spent on the time as a at the re adaptation of the as a volume up and down
65-2_853.54_6.13.wav_ASR	uh and uh um because i i started off four which is twenty years after the eighty four
65-2_860.446_8.79.wav_ASR	and it became rather troublesome to me because having they just didn't do the battery for the brand in those years
65-2_869.993_1.69.wav_ASR	so there is no problem
65-2_871.699_1.97.wav_ASR	you just you are able to write
65-2_873.684_3.67.wav_ASR	but i think you're able to just change the desktop go on
65-2_878.184_5.53.wav_ASR	um and uh 'cause they just did their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their
65-2_883.737_16.3.wav_ASR	and over the course next twenty years uh wise and i found out about um from people that had their grandkids' birthdays later
65-2_901.056_3.61.wav_ASR	and the software updates are four to five times a year
65-2_905.719_4.72.wav_ASR	as what they're telling people even fifteen years ago
65-2_911.291_15.93.wav_ASR	um and so i wanted to uh want to share that with with the pages that uh gives them hope that uh that record is r curious is is is possible
65-2_928.404_1.38.wav_ASR	yeah it takes a long time
65-2_930.61_10.94.wav_ASR	and in low four when i started their at r. i. uh it was i heard euros and their families and their families
65-2_942.297_1.58.wav_ASR	uh a euro
65-2_944.156_1.01.wav_ASR	here you are in effect
65-2_945.302_0.94.wav_ASR	here you go
65-2_947.407_3.51.wav_ASR	hey you don't stop remembering
65-2_950.937_7.04.wav_ASR	but the rate may be asymmetrical if you will and slow down pretty rapidly after a a euro in half
65-2_958.775_1.9.wav_ASR	you never never stop recording
65-2_961.454_7.72.wav_ASR	uh i had a in the eight yeah eighty four percent i had a a dead spot with no feeling above the left
65-2_970.136_2.65.wav_ASR	and there's just something that i excluded
65-2_972.842_1.73.wav_ASR	and it was a spongy
65-2_974.655_0.98.wav_ASR	you know no big deal
65-2_975.956_3.16.wav_ASR	but uh stick a pin there but
65-2_979.96_1.4.wav_ASR	uh no no big deal
65-2_981.865_4.86.wav_ASR	and then it was probably even five years ago or something twenty two
65-2_987.413_0.4.wav_ASR	think so
65-2_987.879_0.74.wav_ASR	oh no
65-2_989.309_5.7.wav_ASR	twenty five euros after the eighty four inch i was in the in the bedroom put up my socks one morning
65-2_996.424_4.47.wav_ASR	and i had feeling in the spot that had no feeling with twenty five euros
65-2_1002.063_12.36.wav_ASR	so what i'm what i'm telling you actually is that the cover makes a small down significantly
65-2_1014.632_2.9.wav_ASR	it's still yeah it's never stopped curvy
65-2_1017.689_1.16.wav_ASR	you just don't talk
65-2_1019.52_6.059.wav_ASR	yeah i don't think
65-2_1068.805_3.42.wav_ASR	yes
65-2_1072.242_7.48.wav_ASR	it's time time time is the best uh time is the best uh it's the best uh it's the best uh it's the best uh it's the best uh it's the best uh it's the best uh it's the best uh it's the best
65-2_1080.467_7.98.wav_ASR	because you you the feeling that the feeling that you don't have it will less and uh less and important
65-2_1088.535_2.52.wav_ASR	and and you'll notice one day
65-2_1091.749_2.26.wav_ASR	crack i d i i feared it there i didn't have before
65-2_1094.551_1.56.wav_ASR	yeah actually it will happen
65-2_1096.384_0.98.wav_ASR	you will experience that
65-2_1108.416_2.63.wav_ASR	um i actually don't know
65-2_1111.095_6.75.wav_ASR	it was it was uh it just i mean i was used to uh a little bit of a little pink print et cetera
65-2_1118.126_4.87.wav_ASR	but i i don't i don't know if i got used to it or or ignored or or
65-2_1124.138_3.5.wav_ASR	but uh like i said twenty five euros later just put on the socks one morning
65-2_1128.17_0.83.wav_ASR	hey wait a minute
65-2_1129.343_1.05.wav_ASR	uh i got a feeling there
65-2_1131.24_2.06.wav_ASR	and had had had none before
65-2_1134.534_0.63.wav_ASR	don't want
65-2_1135.397_0.91.wav_ASR	you have no idea
65-2_1149.083_1.64.wav_ASR	they will it will
65-2_1150.924_0.87.wav_ASR	yeah
65-2_1151.84_1.31.wav_ASR	and they they will
65-2_1153.17_0.46.wav_ASR	they will
65-2_1173.169_4.87.wav_ASR	oh yeah the when the when i when i i first time i met my wife
65-2_1179.585_5.52.wav_ASR	when when she when i she and i first met uh we are we're hardware gadgets
65-2_1185.345_2.45.wav_ASR	um we we went d we went to the different hills again
65-2_1188.603_5.09.wav_ASR	uh per from the uh the new washing in the end and uh the new washing in the end
65-2_1193.708_1.47.wav_ASR	uh myself from the plain feed
65-2_1195.197_4.75.wav_ASR	uh and it was before class is started at pedro
65-2_1200.599_1.59.wav_ASR	allergic to ninety seven
65-2_1203.067_4.66.wav_ASR	uh it was uh uh first day on camp
65-2_1208.447_1.29.wav_ASR	my first day in america
65-2_1210.419_10.65.wav_ASR	um there was to be a a dance at uh the the door i was staying at uh this this one night
65-2_1221.089_2.26.wav_ASR	again again it's our first part
65-2_1224.373_5.17.wav_ASR	and uh and uh and i was a little bit early
65-2_1229.596_7.78.wav_ASR	which i will arrive at place of a little bit early given a little control of of the of the situation
65-2_1238.004_3.79.wav_ASR	and uh so i had to be just a little bit earlier for the for the dinner there
65-2_1242.551_5.71.wav_ASR	and uh and uh my wife and uh and her her wing man
65-2_1248.927_1.99.wav_ASR	yeah giraffes giraffe's go with it but
65-2_1251.625_0.36.wav_ASR	it's just
65-2_1252.36_7.75.wav_ASR	her name's her name's her name's her name's her name's her name's her name's
65-2_1260.78_3.88.wav_ASR	and the uh and uh sand is why it's never matter
65-2_1265.396_2.78.wav_ASR	they it's the a a true uh etcetera
65-2_1268.95_2.08.wav_ASR	yeah but you look up and a zebra extra
65-2_1272.802_5.88.wav_ASR	uh but anyway so so uh she and a girl friend uh walked up to me and
65-2_1278.901_2.74.wav_ASR	uh he is the uh he's the the the designer here
65-2_1281.66_2.44.wav_ASR	yeah well
65-2_1284.355_0.44.wav_ASR	of course
65-2_1284.946_0.71.wav_ASR	that's why
65-2_1285.671_4.64.wav_ASR	and uh and we i just uh i hung around
65-2_1290.557_3.4.wav_ASR	oh yeah i uh i ran her that uh that uh that
65-2_1294.796_2.28.wav_ASR	and uh that's where we started dating
65-2_1297.1_3.94.wav_ASR	and uh
65-2_1301.09_1.27.wav_ASR	again about three euros
65-2_1303.312_4.59.wav_ASR	and after about uh four years uh figured out that well maybe something's going on here
65-2_1307.917_1.44.wav_ASR	and i gotta get more serious about this
65-2_1310.334_6.28.wav_ASR	so it was just like i i'd i'd argue here of of uh picking me up at a at a at a at a scroll dance
65-2_1317.648_2.02.wav_ASR	that's where we're where we're where we're supposed to be on a day
65-2_1359.514_5.59.wav_ASR	uh a young a young boy it's look like a s a a cradle
65-2_1365.124_0.54.wav_ASR	okay
65-2_1366.388_2.61.wav_ASR	it it it it it goes up to the top of the couch
65-2_1369.723_9.4.wav_ASR	uh a gentle one on a couch uh here in the window it's a bit right by where the square ball comes through and it surprises him
65-2_1379.989_6.19.wav_ASR	and then he he gets the balls that stands by the broccoli window trying to find out just to what went on
65-2_1402.182_12.63.wav_ASR	and the beginning is this this mother it appears uh has to have it to her spongy and want to give it to her son before we goes off to her spongy
65-2_1415.551_2.24.wav_ASR	uh and uh
65-2_1418.288_0.93.wav_ASR	it's just no
65-2_1419.62_0.77.wav_ASR	oh no
65-2_1421.306_1.08.wav_ASR	and then
65-2_1422.451_2.41.wav_ASR	and then in the middle it's hard landing on him
65-2_1425.438_1.43.wav_ASR	and then range over on and off
65-2_1426.933_7.19.wav_ASR	and then and then uh he goes back on just uh software the bottom as with brother kind of framing at
65-2_1434.453_6.25.wav_ASR	and then the last the end of the story was he learned in school and uh has the alphabet with him
65-2_1455.01_13.73.wav_ASR	the way this started was that uh it looks like uh th there is a a a three with a dog at the at the base of the tree a a a male and a female
65-2_1469.12_2.18.wav_ASR	the dog is barking at a dog is barking at this guy
65-2_1471.974_7.79.wav_ASR	and uh on the on the on the treble line there's a cat with a giraffe down and a triangle down below this cat
65-2_1480.206_6.04.wav_ASR	and it would appear that uh a a a cat climbed up the tree
65-2_1487.152_3.15.wav_ASR	the uh the little guys called up the tree and got stuck up there
65-2_1491.016_10.21.wav_ASR	they they uh by mail a man uh oh was either being chased up the tree by the dog or climbed the tree
65-2_1501.878_3.4.wav_ASR	it's also a a fire trap and a fire ring
65-2_1506.838_1.32.wav_ASR	the pear or fruit and leather
65-2_1508.684_7.57.wav_ASR	and it looks like the la the the the ladder is being used by the family or the the cat or both
65-2_1517.004_11.24.wav_ASR	uh and uh and they and they're a wrong button is over and a a a remote tree limb just singing away just observing the the old old storm
65-2_1528.296_3.07.wav_ASR	or
65-2_1754.983_9.4.wav_ASR	cinetis was uh the the director of uh a t a t a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
65-2_1764.522_2.45.wav_ASR	see her mother had passed a and i thought it was passed away
65-2_1767.818_1.36.wav_ASR	and our father remarried
65-2_1769.925_8.29.wav_ASR	and the steph mother had the uh two two dollars uh we're we're i mean we need a new new dollar
65-2_1778.914_21.3.wav_ASR	uh and as they were ready uh the the uh bather and the stepmother married uh sent uh the the staff member went beyond the uh round the place where around the uh the steph did it did it basically nothing
65-2_1801.139_8.38.wav_ASR	and uh so so s cinderella's spent her time working cleaning uh polishing the kind of stuff around the house
65-2_1810.138_10.22.wav_ASR	and and uh in that in the kingdom there was uh a a press who was not married
65-2_1821.196_18.68.wav_ASR	um and the designer to the king s his own he has the the extra spec expertise of the his s his spongy's in the kingdom
65-2_1840.902_3.19.wav_ASR	oh so the word was put out about the ball coming up
65-2_1844.858_6.3.wav_ASR	uh cinderella was really happy about the bo about the ball coming coming up as were the the steph's sisters
65-2_1851.712_16.43.wav_ASR	uh and so they they um their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their
65-2_1868.918_10.26.wav_ASR	and uh and then at the last minute uh the step mother told centred she was not going to the to the ball
65-2_1879.2_8.54.wav_ASR	and and they uh and they also the the steph darlings were we're really really me really mean to her
65-2_1888.574_2.81.wav_ASR	uh and so so the standards went to the ball
65-2_1892.097_14.38.wav_ASR	and but in the meantime while uh before b uh before the ball or at the before the ball um a s uh sender's phone number showed up and and said that well
65-2_1906.5_5.6.wav_ASR	and so it um made for her a just a a lovely gown
65-2_1912.863_16.73.wav_ASR	and they they turn a a spongin into a a coke uh old by by uh um by the time uh we're that end up in the corners
65-2_1930.594_4.29.wav_ASR	um and uh so she went to the ball
65-2_1935.637_15.69.wav_ASR	uh and uh um the trend uh was according to the step uh step drawers and and every everyone's around there and and then and only hit it off with the sender
65-2_1951.795_2.29.wav_ASR	instead of spending the night dancing with the sender
65-2_1954.409_7.13.wav_ASR	that that uh he has to be gone by mid night but that uh he has to be gone by mid night because this this all will end at midnight
65-2_1962.363_5.08.wav_ASR	and so the the the print and sender were demanding at mid night
65-2_1967.926_1.87.wav_ASR	and and
65-2_1970.219_0.31.wav_ASR	oh no
65-2_1970.547_6.69.wav_ASR	and it runs runs out of the the runs out of the place leaving a glass slider one glass slider behind
65-2_1978.161_9.82.wav_ASR	and as she's being driven uh driving back and forth the the uh um coach turned back into the pump
65-2_1988.0_2.49.wav_ASR	and the the horse turned back and the mouse
65-2_1990.617_5.26.wav_ASR	and the the fruit and veg in the house uh and uh our our our dog
65-2_1996.13_0.56.wav_ASR	or maybe right
65-2_1997.231_3.15.wav_ASR	and then so but still that it was over
65-2_2000.401_10.91.wav_ASR	and uh and then after the balls decided that there was only the only the s only the colour that there was only the only this kind of colour that he would interest in
65-2_2012.653_3.04.wav_ASR	obviously you could probably do a strawberry was could not find her
65-2_2016.419_10.69.wav_ASR	uh and so he put his device out of the task of of trying to locate sensor with the glass the glass slider that that uh she left behind
65-2_2027.888_3.08.wav_ASR	and uh came to the centre line
65-2_2031.017_3.76.wav_ASR	the they splintered not fit the the steph sisters
65-2_2035.46_4.69.wav_ASR	uh and then but but it did fit uh it fit it
65-2_2041.079_9.609.wav_ASR	uh and so it ended up uh uh being that that sender and the print was got together we're already lit up happily over
65-2_2063.239_2.41.wav_ASR	you have a two slides of a red
65-2_2066.402_6.391.wav_ASR	yeah it's a pineapple and a jelly and uh a nice or or a sponge
65-2_2073.536_1.341.wav_ASR	go back to two pieces of bread
65-2_2075.728_3.94.wav_ASR	spread the patty butter from the jar on one of the pieces of of red
65-2_2080.572_5.141.wav_ASR	and then you you spread the it spreads the gel on the other piece of red
65-2_2086.377_2.24.wav_ASR	uh then you put the pieces of red together
65-2_2088.635_2.25.wav_ASR	and there you have a ping button
richardson16a_10.7_4.51.wav_ASR	uh strawberries
richardson16a_17.87_12.8.wav_ASR	uh i i uh i don't talk well
richardson16a_31.22_5.93.wav_ASR	uh i so i don't get the lot too much it's talking
richardson16a_49.929_0.47.wav_ASR	guess
richardson16a_52.74_11.92.wav_ASR	uh i i was off from from work uh sad
richardson16a_65.34_2.55.wav_ASR	and this thing i don't know
richardson16a_68.947_2.09.wav_ASR	and d no
richardson16a_71.271_1.62.wav_ASR	just happy like that
richardson16a_73.45_11.01.wav_ASR	uh and we've got a. s. d.
richardson16a_85.34_7.84.wav_ASR	uh when the the glass i brought to but can i on me
richardson16a_93.372_9.44.wav_ASR	like a like a he said the and be l. c. d. screen over ja ja ja ja ja ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju ju
richardson16a_103.78_7.31.wav_ASR	uh uh was uh they not to the door
richardson16a_111.14_3.2.wav_ASR	and i came to what in the like
richardson16a_115.09_0.66.wav_ASR	we should
richardson16a_116.187_1.13.wav_ASR	what happened
richardson16a_118.44_2.68.wav_ASR	the s lamp the door
richardson16a_122.01_12.89.wav_ASR	uh and our leader uh the same guy came back and uh to me and uh to me
richardson16a_135.763_3.57.wav_ASR	and uh they did and uh merri merri merri merri merri merri
richardson16a_140.09_0.74.wav_ASR	or chip
richardson16a_141.446_4.6.wav_ASR	it calls over here and voice machine over here
richardson16a_146.61_1.13.wav_ASR	yeah
richardson16a_154.268_2.58.wav_ASR	oh but uh
richardson16a_160.82_12.18.wav_ASR	um

tap18a_221.227_11.86.wav_ASR	and and i think i was g i but my flops uh were d i i forgot them
tap18a_233.905_1.78.wav_ASR	and they're pink
tap18a_236.652_0.54.wav_ASR	yeah i said
tap18a_238.828_3.26.wav_ASR	my i li i like those
tap18a_242.792_1.02.wav_ASR	you know the other thing
tap18a_244.885_0.346.wav_ASR	yeah
tap18a_246.023_5.59.wav_ASR	and uh i had r. d. b r. s and a penises and the bor
tap18a_251.71_0.4.wav_ASR	it's it
tap18a_252.866_6.54.wav_ASR	um so i w what i was thinking about the car my
tap18a_260.97_3.93.wav_ASR	my i have the me uh can
tap18a_266.814_1.48.wav_ASR	because now i'm nervous of course
tap18a_268.352_5.76.wav_ASR	um i'm b mike has the wrong over
tap18a_274.793_2.84.wav_ASR	you knew this because it's a high up
tap18a_280.324_5.15.wav_ASR	but i think uh my eyes bad going down
tap18a_287.98_3.2.wav_ASR	uh i was u can't is a little bit
tap18a_292.116_3.57.wav_ASR	and after that i couldn't see anything else
tap18a_303.312_1.886.wav_ASR	so i i'll do you everything
tap18a_305.672_1.76.wav_ASR	flowers i had the flowers
tap18a_308.002_0.63.wav_ASR	two ones
tap18a_309.091_3.03.wav_ASR	uh everything is the
tap18a_313.426_7.67.wav_ASR	yes also i know the stroke after the stroke no after the hardware i was worried
tap18a_322.56_1.58.wav_ASR	or i'm dead and dead
tap18a_324.893_7.67.wav_ASR	but that's okay because i'm happy and kids are happy
tap18a_333.448_3.51.wav_ASR	oh um it's a good idea
tap18a_338.477_0.6.wav_ASR	everything
tap18a_348.911_0.37.wav_ASR	okay
tap18a_350.845_11.07.wav_ASR	um
tap18a_363.68_0.96.wav_ASR	well i thought oh okay
tap18a_364.824_1.38.wav_ASR	up would be the wheel here
tap18a_367.095_3.49.wav_ASR	they just said maybe i can't walk over it or
tap18a_371.072_3.11.wav_ASR	maybe i can't to speak again
tap18a_374.852_3.26.wav_ASR	maybe i can't the arm nick and
tap18a_378.493_0.42.wav_ASR	everything
tap18a_379.757_0.39.wav_ASR	okay
tap18a_382.372_1.03.wav_ASR	well i guess i
tap18a_383.727_1.93.wav_ASR	well i could do it myself
tap18a_387.312_0.82.wav_ASR	in my mind
tap18a_388.863_3.77.wav_ASR	so i i had this personal access
tap18a_393.615_9.12.wav_ASR	and a. o. and p. o. and p. t. o. in physical perhaps

tcu07a_76.138_0.61.wav_ASR	he was there
tcu07a_77.528_4.12.wav_ASR	and um and it's so funny
tcu07a_82.03_3.09.wav_ASR	or kate myself kept my self in the end
tcu07a_85.47_2.96.wav_ASR	just a cut enough to get the dog and
tcu07a_90.338_2.35.wav_ASR	in the after yeah i don't mind per anything
tcu07a_94.397_1.61.wav_ASR	yeah and then uh
tcu07a_98.029_0.55.wav_ASR	yeah
tcu07a_98.865_9.01.wav_ASR	and um and i don't know if anything after that for two d. two
tcu07a_110.575_0.31.wav_ASR	yeah
tcu07a_111.612_4.26.wav_ASR	and then as as i s i s no you know what was going on
tcu07a_116.162_2.63.wav_ASR	you just couldn't understand what they were
tcu07a_119.029_2.3.wav_ASR	oh yeah and i just didn't know what they were talking about
tcu07a_121.352_1.93.wav_ASR	you mean they just you know
tcu07a_124.592_1.89.wav_ASR	yeah they i mean they didn't know any
tcu07a_126.5_10.94.wav_ASR	and i mean olivier oh it told me so far was one d to to the dock was just one thing though i could talk to
tcu07a_137.758_1.3.wav_ASR	we need a new
tcu07a_139.078_3.58.wav_ASR	oh i mean i just wouldn't need anything from our
tcu07a_142.674_1.05.wav_ASR	but there was no
tcu07a_145.779_0.98.wav_ASR	yeah
tcu07a_147.708_0.39.wav_ASR	now
tcu07a_148.577_1.32.wav_ASR	it was all just
tcu07a_150.785_1.31.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
tcu07a_152.727_1.77.wav_ASR	in um i dunno
tcu07a_154.514_1.02.wav_ASR	oh no i think about that
tcu07a_155.555_8.91.wav_ASR	you don't know what i um but i but maybe it's really is that i can't
tcu07a_165.334_0.61.wav_ASR	you don't remember
tcu07a_165.963_6.11.wav_ASR	or i just know that that started dolly you know going in and
tcu07a_172.235_1.75.wav_ASR	they started dicking on me
tcu07a_174.0_3.31.wav_ASR	you know i started it's so hard little bit
tcu07a_178.01_2.7.wav_ASR	but there were a lot of things like my name
tcu07a_180.919_4.97.wav_ASR	but i mean i'd just now you know the name
tcu07a_185.908_1.85.wav_ASR	it's no it was yeah you know
tcu07a_187.777_1.06.wav_ASR	oh no
tcu07a_189.134_2.56.wav_ASR	seven people you can get well that easy
tcu07a_192.031_0.89.wav_ASR	but me
tcu07a_200.296_0.34.wav_ASR	yeah
tcu07a_200.964_6.82.wav_ASR	and my n and uh and name and in my name my name my name my name my name
tcu07a_208.7_5.2.wav_ASR	you mean the other thing that you wanna know is my um
tcu07a_215.061_0.83.wav_ASR	i don't remember
tcu07a_215.906_3.67.wav_ASR	uh i can't remember a lot of things
tcu07a_219.6_1.14.wav_ASR	they g yes i guess it
tcu07a_221.351_6.26.wav_ASR	it's so they just in every i mean totally i've been so deeply i've been doing it
tcu07a_227.633_2.48.wav_ASR	and i mean yeah they've been n
tcu07a_236.428_2.45.wav_ASR	um i don't know
tcu07a_239.174_1.82.wav_ASR	and then you think about it i dunno
tcu07a_241.134_0.35.wav_ASR	then you don't know
tcu07a_244.801_0.45.wav_ASR	okay
tcu07a_252.532_0.39.wav_ASR	yeah
tcu07a_252.946_1.09.wav_ASR	okay so
tcu07a_261.678_10.64.wav_ASR	um well they've been going in th uh i've been i'm going to the um i'll in the um
tcu07a_275.306_3.41.wav_ASR	oh um and um the
tcu07a_278.941_5.81.wav_ASR	they're they have every three days they have me
tcu07a_284.77_5.06.wav_ASR	and the i mean they're in the they um t. v.
tcu07a_289.849_2.0.wav_ASR	they they don't they are ever
tcu07a_292.232_6.95.wav_ASR	and i can talk of every three m. three days at t again
tcu07a_299.2_1.1.wav_ASR	in a. r. t. v.
tcu07a_300.459_2.54.wav_ASR	and uh talk and talk it up
tcu07a_303.189_9.4.wav_ASR	so um i do find out feel that when i go with my band that it helps some
tcu07a_312.787_1.43.wav_ASR	yeah i find that uh
tcu07a_314.811_3.77.wav_ASR	it seems like every time i a bit more a little bit more you know
tcu07a_318.6_0.53.wav_ASR	so
tcu07a_320.674_0.42.wav_ASR	yeah
tcu07a_322.153_0.55.wav_ASR	yeah
tcu07a_358.045_6.12.wav_ASR	um let's n let's n the n the d. v. m. but i don't know
tcu07a_365.261_1.33.wav_ASR	yeah
tcu07a_367.6_2.3.wav_ASR	but it's hard to think of the
tcu07a_370.3_3.58.wav_ASR	um um i
tcu07a_374.981_1.26.wav_ASR	yeah probably
tcu07a_378.643_0.4.wav_ASR	yeah
tcu07a_386.09_0.55.wav_ASR	yeah
tcu07a_387.006_0.82.wav_ASR	that's a good one
tcu07a_390.512_0.62.wav_ASR	oh
tcu07a_391.301_5.4.wav_ASR	um um he um he he gives me a lot
tcu07a_396.719_2.71.wav_ASR	uh i mean he i didn't have him
tcu07a_401.411_5.31.wav_ASR	but um they keep the l a lot of the time from me
tcu07a_408.237_4.18.wav_ASR	um
tcu07a_413.77_2.46.wav_ASR	and don't think what else i can draw
tcu07a_422.86_7.74.wav_ASR	um well mm i don't know
tcu07a_431.851_1.14.wav_ASR	kinetic
tcu07a_433.5_4.17.wav_ASR	it's it's kinda hard to buy it has to buy thing
tcu07a_437.686_2.63.wav_ASR	it's hard to talk a lot of things
tcu07a_440.368_3.96.wav_ASR	um i don't think who else can who can
tcu07a_445.416_6.7.wav_ASR	uh no my my uh i know well i know i know they but i don't they uh i know they but i don't sometimes they don't
tcu07a_454.244_1.07.wav_ASR	they it's fine
tcu07a_455.33_6.1.wav_ASR	they they they all my friends i know that i'm member things
tcu07a_462.238_2.28.wav_ASR	and but i don't remember
tcu07a_464.828_0.52.wav_ASR	and no
tcu07a_465.853_0.65.wav_ASR	it's the weirdest
tcu07a_473.491_1.459.wav_ASR	uh i i kind of wonder you know
tcu07a_474.967_2.21.wav_ASR	you don't i'm a rabbit but i don't
tcu07a_477.224_2.28.wav_ASR	yeah but i don't i know it
tcu07a_481.185_1.145.wav_ASR	but i don't know
tcu07a_499.703_0.49.wav_ASR	okay
tcu07a_500.888_2.29.wav_ASR	um there is a da
tcu07a_505.634_2.07.wav_ASR	we had my dog dog
tcu07a_508.455_0.94.wav_ASR	we have a
tcu07a_512.279_0.63.wav_ASR	we have
tcu07a_514.114_1.27.wav_ASR	oh okay
tcu07a_516.746_6.841.wav_ASR	we have a g wire boy who um
tcu07a_523.823_5.47.wav_ASR	he w he d was here is he was doing his
tcu07a_530.721_3.18.wav_ASR	you were on your dog i mean you hit that hard mm-hmm
tcu07a_535.111_2.87.wav_ASR	and he won't yeah
tcu07a_538.17_2.34.wav_ASR	and yeah he i
tcu07a_541.2_5.12.wav_ASR	he went his his thing
tcu07a_547.025_3.51.wav_ASR	you met to the ding um
tcu07a_552.581_9.56.wav_ASR	and they and it go draw and draw onto the t. d. yeah here
tcu07a_563.166_6.88.wav_ASR	and in and the the
tcu07a_571.77_0.61.wav_ASR	guillotine
tcu07a_574.061_11.43.wav_ASR	the was i g gave it and put out what was going on
tcu07a_585.595_0.57.wav_ASR	now
tcu07a_591.788_0.35.wav_ASR	okay
tcu07a_601.0_0.36.wav_ASR	okay
tcu07a_602.696_0.46.wav_ASR	okay
tcu07a_603.992_8.79.wav_ASR	mm there was a mother and her but yeah ho her her bit or her g her her her
tcu07a_615.423_20.75.wav_ASR	and he was um giving her to to take the s t told her to take the to the g go give it
tcu07a_637.149_2.45.wav_ASR	it's so um
tcu07a_642.247_0.35.wav_ASR	it's a c. d.
tcu07a_642.854_1.48.wav_ASR	we don't need it
tcu07a_645.573_10.02.wav_ASR	and so he started to da got got goo goo goo goo goo goo
tcu07a_656.225_7.02.wav_ASR	and he started it and realised that he was he needed it he needed it
tcu07a_663.668_10.2.wav_ASR	so i it was uh so he d got the he got the thing from m. m.
tcu07a_674.299_13.15.wav_ASR	and and now he got me he got me again he got me he got i got a he got me he got a thing yeah
tcu07a_705.629_0.55.wav_ASR	okay
tcu07a_706.919_0.66.wav_ASR	and there's
tcu07a_709.213_4.84.wav_ASR	you is talk so he is dicking docking
tcu07a_714.105_3.62.wav_ASR	you mean he's t talking back
tcu07a_718.686_2.0.wav_ASR	and he is
tcu07a_722.226_6.54.wav_ASR	but he was he was had his thing
tcu07a_729.621_0.69.wav_ASR	and he felt
tcu07a_730.508_2.92.wav_ASR	is the more he is uh his thing
tcu07a_734.264_6.18.wav_ASR	it's so no he's just appear in the by himself
tcu07a_741.603_4.92.wav_ASR	and so he uh somebody told
tcu07a_747.232_5.05.wav_ASR	and so now he's he's a man is coming up
tcu07a_752.706_2.87.wav_ASR	and they're gonna get the t to
tcu07a_756.359_2.18.wav_ASR	we need the thing up
tcu07a_759.12_5.13.wav_ASR	so he can take his arm and make it down
tcu07a_766.256_4.05.wav_ASR	but the reason even means he was on here the
tcu07a_771.091_5.47.wav_ASR	was 'cause i got a bad hand and but was having to help her
tcu07a_777.474_8.41.wav_ASR	with the dog
tcu07a_786.29_0.77.wav_ASR	can't think of a
tcu07a_788.525_7.26.wav_ASR	um and um and that's how it in the anyway
tcu07a_796.339_5.59.wav_ASR	but it ended up he didn't it be the one that was in the end to be the one that was in the end
tcu07a_803.428_0.37.wav_ASR	okay
tcu07a_810.884_0.43.wav_ASR	yeah
tcu07a_817.503_0.34.wav_ASR	yeah
tcu07a_822.929_1.62.wav_ASR	mind yourself of the details
tcu07a_824.817_0.32.wav_ASR	uh-huh
tcu07a_829.258_0.31.wav_ASR	okay
tcu07a_832.777_0.33.wav_ASR	okay
tcu07a_923.902_0.54.wav_ASR	okay
tcu07a_932.792_1.57.wav_ASR	okay um
tcu07a_936.625_3.32.wav_ASR	um she was a um
tcu07a_943.222_1.11.wav_ASR	and
tcu07a_947.118_4.63.wav_ASR	see well a. she was a.
tcu07a_955.779_0.59.wav_ASR	or i mean yeah
tcu07a_956.619_4.65.wav_ASR	he was um he was
tcu07a_969.306_4.23.wav_ASR	you mean in their i mean our our
tcu07a_974.209_3.69.wav_ASR	he didn't mean to be um
tcu07a_978.898_11.55.wav_ASR	they were all three gonna wait gonna take ki d. gonna go to the
tcu07a_991.517_2.85.wav_ASR	it was a dur um dur dur dur dur dur dur dur dur dur dur dur dur dur dur dur dur dur dur dur
tcu07a_995.165_3.1.wav_ASR	and they wouldn't let her
tcu07a_999.781_0.87.wav_ASR	so they went
tcu07a_1001.665_2.88.wav_ASR	and is and and c. v. s and and c. r.
tcu07a_1004.567_11.65.wav_ASR	or in our d this layer our our was like our m mo was like uh thing um her mother's uh thing um her mother's uh thing
tcu07a_1016.234_0.87.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
tcu07a_1017.905_4.8.wav_ASR	and so she d did a thing on them
tcu07a_1023.107_4.01.wav_ASR	and he and and so he ran it he he ran
tcu07a_1028.26_2.54.wav_ASR	and he could do it for so long
tcu07a_1031.136_3.36.wav_ASR	and then and then he he had to get it home
tcu07a_1034.922_4.78.wav_ASR	because he would be t to go back in to the
tcu07a_1040.481_1.68.wav_ASR	he would charge
tcu07a_1043.239_4.609.wav_ASR	so after the after that he left
tcu07a_1051.113_2.61.wav_ASR	he lost her ring behind
tcu07a_1054.499_2.85.wav_ASR	so he did he tied the bander
tcu07a_1058.294_7.77.wav_ASR	and they had to t get to every body
tcu07a_1066.532_4.0.wav_ASR	and he find finding it
tcu07a_1070.549_1.74.wav_ASR	it's she was the one
tcu07a_1072.994_5.63.wav_ASR	and they were in viver
tcu07a_1078.898_1.38.wav_ASR	yeah
tcu07a_1090.586_7.4.wav_ASR	um i would get a get a get a get the

tucson17a_1017.135_11.14.wav_ASR	um um um and and um and and and um
tucson17a_1065.547_3.18.wav_ASR	yeah yes
tucson17a_1084.343_6.17.wav_ASR	or it's a rabbit and it's well
tucson17a_1091.135_8.71.wav_ASR	and send with um um two um
tucson17a_1100.705_0.86.wav_ASR	oh okay
tucson17a_1102.921_9.95.wav_ASR	uh penner uh brother um and selvede
tucson17a_1115.13_0.54.wav_ASR	and
tucson17a_1118.72_10.58.wav_ASR	oh that what
UCL02a_6.639_0.36.wav_ASR	yeah
UCL02a_11.585_0.35.wav_ASR	uh-huh
UCL02a_13.404_4.57.wav_ASR	so just talk about my my speech and how it is today this week or
UCL02a_18.68_2.04.wav_ASR	well it could be today or well it depends yeah
UCL02a_25.837_2.86.wav_ASR	um my speech and this talking today
UCL02a_31.699_1.62.wav_ASR	um
UCL02a_34.593_2.69.wav_ASR	um
UCL02a_37.33_2.09.wav_ASR	so time's supposed to be limited isn't it
UCL02a_39.439_0.94.wav_ASR	that's right
UCL02a_40.4_0.93.wav_ASR	it's a little isn't it today
UCL02a_43.429_1.1.wav_ASR	speech recognition
UCL02a_44.544_1.86.wav_ASR	sometimes they can't talk
UCL02a_47.789_2.6.wav_ASR	um not here what's happening about me now
UCL02a_50.411_1.47.wav_ASR	can't um
UCL02a_53.073_3.41.wav_ASR	you know this is a big problem because sometimes suddenly one word just goes
UCL02a_56.5_1.63.wav_ASR	um you know that that
UCL02a_58.449_1.89.wav_ASR	oh i just talked you out then no i can't remember
UCL02a_61.489_4.3.wav_ASR	some weeks i pu um i think i can hear about everything
UCL02a_66.983_3.54.wav_ASR	um um i can hear everything
UCL02a_70.775_5.62.wav_ASR	uh and then suddenly we can just just um discovers that i mean now
UCL02a_77.532_0.76.wav_ASR	it's hard to tell
UCL02a_78.308_2.25.wav_ASR	sometimes suddenly one day it can be perfect
UCL02a_81.517_1.77.wav_ASR	well not perfect i mean but it is decent
UCL02a_83.309_5.47.wav_ASR	then sometimes it's um um i just can't hear some things you know
UCL02a_88.8_1.82.wav_ASR	that's a difficult thing but with the speech
UCL02a_92.492_4.69.wav_ASR	um and then on top of sometimes it's it's okay
UCL02a_97.24_3.13.wav_ASR	and then of course certainly one word is just describing me as well
UCL02a_100.812_1.34.wav_ASR	oh
UCL02a_102.173_0.54.wav_ASR	that's the key
UCL02a_103.893_3.39.wav_ASR	and then suddenly one word is brilliant for speaking to to speak everybody
UCL02a_107.33_0.65.wav_ASR	it's good for me
UCL02a_108.7_2.11.wav_ASR	and then suddenly just make me so tired
UCL02a_111.006_1.62.wav_ASR	well not tired but then i just can't hear
UCL02a_112.82_1.55.wav_ASR	it's difficult to tell you no
UCL02a_115.317_8.88.wav_ASR	um yeah um well i'd talk about that as well
UCL02a_124.218_1.15.wav_ASR	so you don't have to worry as well
UCL02a_125.597_8.35.wav_ASR	um i tried many times about my speech to everybody
UCL02a_134.03_3.34.wav_ASR	um sometimes it's brilliant
UCL02a_137.419_4.91.wav_ASR	one people are talking to me and then um i guess that what they're talking to me is
UCL02a_142.345_3.14.wav_ASR	but i think maybe one little word is is it's appeared from me now
UCL02a_146.052_0.98.wav_ASR	one word just go
UCL02a_147.699_2.65.wav_ASR	and then sometimes it's just terrible one i can't even think
UCL02a_151.038_4.42.wav_ASR	um
UCL02a_155.949_12.23.wav_ASR	um sometimes the bad thing is sometimes where is you you can't do anything for me
UCL02a_168.2_1.91.wav_ASR	that's that's bit big
UCL02a_171.11_1.02.wav_ASR	it's very difficult
UCL02a_172.344_1.12.wav_ASR	it's very difficult some times
UCL02a_173.565_1.16.wav_ASR	that's when you would be bad with it
UCL02a_175.216_2.16.wav_ASR	it can't speak to my
UCL02a_177.398_0.78.wav_ASR	go on to me
UCL02a_178.199_1.64.wav_ASR	that's very difficult especially like that
UCL02a_180.635_5.7.wav_ASR	um and you get um frustrating frustrating fist
UCL02a_186.35_0.66.wav_ASR	kinda think that yeah
UCL02a_187.33_0.32.wav_ASR	yeah
UCL02a_188.404_3.4.wav_ASR	well um that can be terrible sometimes
UCL02a_192.01_4.9.wav_ASR	um sometimes like um
UCL02a_198.705_2.08.wav_ASR	developed for me about what's talking about speech as well
UCL02a_200.83_1.55.wav_ASR	sometimes that's no reading books
UCL02a_202.4_2.79.wav_ASR	so used a lot of things you know before i did the remote okay
UCL02a_205.21_1.04.wav_ASR	but i read a lot of books
UCL02a_206.693_3.1.wav_ASR	now is difficult for me is why i'm speaking but my books to me
UCL02a_210.781_7.56.wav_ASR	and the other thing from my point of view it's something that i'm reading so my books about two pages in my and i don't know what i talk about
UCL02a_218.619_3.13.wav_ASR	the half the pages are reading about and then suddenly
UCL02a_222.2_2.17.wav_ASR	good s yes that's pretty much what i'm reading about that
UCL02a_224.65_1.38.wav_ASR	then suddenly one brain helps
UCL02a_226.05_0.43.wav_ASR	just go
UCL02a_226.69_0.88.wav_ASR	it's terrible as well
UCL02a_228.468_4.2.wav_ASR	so many time and i'm reading again and i can't help what i'm talking about the time before
UCL02a_232.729_1.01.wav_ASR	alrighty you know
UCL02a_234.485_8.7.wav_ASR	um um yeah i dunno like what i'm watching films and things like that from me as well
UCL02a_243.916_13.13.wav_ASR	um well watching films or um d. v. d. d. s sometimes um i have to watch everything to s to sub titles
UCL02a_258.261_9.22.wav_ASR	um that has to be as well like sub titles and i i w the the the d. v. d. s and i the next day or something like that
UCL02a_268.09_0.94.wav_ASR	so things are again
UCL02a_269.046_0.67.wav_ASR	that's quite good
UCL02a_270.468_3.7.wav_ASR	um 'cause i can't what they talk about
UCL02a_274.691_5.27.wav_ASR	um sub titles are really good for me um important
UCL02a_282.717_3.23.wav_ASR	um uh then of course what would happen to me with my stroke as well
UCL02a_285.97_2.58.wav_ASR	of course um you know i did a lot with classical music
UCL02a_288.565_1.94.wav_ASR	that was the cost so um
UCL02a_292.355_5.18.wav_ASR	that's the um all the classical music classic music place
UCL02a_297.553_2.03.wav_ASR	so i was listening to german and spanish and stuff like that
UCL02a_299.599_4.57.wav_ASR	that's one of the thing i was doing is the management uh of all the classical music thing with me is that
UCL02a_305.791_4.38.wav_ASR	uh at least my um my classical music is there
UCL02a_311.267_2.23.wav_ASR	um it's strange to me
UCL02a_314.212_3.28.wav_ASR	um i can hear the words particularly about
UCL02a_317.508_1.67.wav_ASR	all the sound of the music is that
UCL02a_319.2_1.21.wav_ASR	can you hear what i'm doing
UCL02a_320.824_0.96.wav_ASR	but it's a surprise i mean
UCL02a_322.053_0.66.wav_ASR	yeah it's that
UCL02a_323.079_2.0.wav_ASR	well i i think that movie is
UCL02a_325.1_0.75.wav_ASR	going here as well
UCL02a_326.28_0.58.wav_ASR	but i can't say
UCL02a_327.06_3.92.wav_ASR	it's a bit of like um it's a bit of a beaver and dada
UCL02a_331.0_0.95.wav_ASR	oh i can see what that is
UCL02a_332.315_0.63.wav_ASR	and then suddenly
UCL02a_333.511_1.24.wav_ASR	yeah it's a bit of a beast
UCL02a_334.876_1.23.wav_ASR	it was the panther's base
UCL02a_336.218_1.82.wav_ASR	that's something one word just goes for me
UCL02a_339.028_2.35.wav_ASR	um you should get a picture of it
UCL02a_341.4_0.32.wav_ASR	oh
UCL02a_341.803_0.93.wav_ASR	and
UCL02a_342.829_1.91.wav_ASR	you know i can remember the word up here is there
UCL02a_344.964_0.93.wav_ASR	can't help you with that
UCL02a_347.417_4.47.wav_ASR	um but the classical music as well thank god from me as well
UCL02a_351.907_3.12.wav_ASR	um things um my music there as well as uh you know
UCL02a_355.5_1.15.wav_ASR	shaking just now
UCL02a_357.482_1.78.wav_ASR	and reading the books can be difficult for me
UCL02a_360.193_2.99.wav_ASR	um the phones i need the sub titles
UCL02a_363.263_3.04.wav_ASR	but then with the music it's brilliant thanks god i mean you know
UCL02a_367.126_5.98.wav_ASR	um many things happened with me in my in my face yeah and things like that a couple of peeps as well
UCL02a_373.127_1.85.wav_ASR	and i've been out with a bit of music as well
UCL02a_374.999_1.1.wav_ASR	that helps people as well
UCL02a_376.116_0.31.wav_ASR	uh-huh
UCL02a_376.48_0.38.wav_ASR	that's right
UCL02a_377.882_5.1.wav_ASR	um
UCL02a_383.006_1.68.wav_ASR	it's just a little things as well you know
UCL02a_384.93_2.72.wav_ASR	um some little things but
UCL02a_388.125_1.06.wav_ASR	yeah it's a bit yeah
UCL02a_394.094_1.97.wav_ASR	tap me on the actual day that i'm supposed to me yeah
UCL02a_397.44_1.06.wav_ASR	what i have
UCL02a_399.855_1.57.wav_ASR	well that was in the f object
UCL02a_402.334_3.75.wav_ASR	it's the it's the um twenty yeah the fifteen yeah
UCL02a_407.543_0.84.wav_ASR	twenty the fifteens
UCL02a_408.4_1.08.wav_ASR	yeah it's making sense to me yeah
UCL02a_409.58_2.56.wav_ASR	so it's the o. g. b. four euros again
UCL02a_414.5_2.34.wav_ASR	yeah i suppose that what i really remember is the strength in
UCL02a_416.862_0.77.wav_ASR	you were in the even
UCL02a_417.65_1.01.wav_ASR	now i got to work
UCL02a_419.58_2.06.wav_ASR	and it's about nine third in the morning
UCL02a_422.308_1.74.wav_ASR	ah that's in the t in the tune
UCL02a_424.068_1.71.wav_ASR	and then it's gonna catch my bus
UCL02a_427.382_1.25.wav_ASR	and they got there into work
UCL02a_429.05_1.69.wav_ASR	and i remember it's really strange
UCL02a_432.378_3.07.wav_ASR	um i was gonna go on to my computer
UCL02a_436.506_0.97.wav_ASR	and then suddenly
UCL02a_437.5_2.4.wav_ASR	you just s i've just switched my computer switch it on
UCL02a_440.439_4.99.wav_ASR	and i could remember what is um how do you use my computer
UCL02a_445.929_3.87.wav_ASR	what's my my my code you know you're you're writing things
UCL02a_450.603_0.68.wav_ASR	come on where is it
UCL02a_451.3_1.04.wav_ASR	congratulations
UCL02a_452.404_0.36.wav_ASR	so
UCL02a_454.288_1.27.wav_ASR	that's what i call my colour
UCL02a_455.628_0.46.wav_ASR	that's right
UCL02a_456.246_7.3.wav_ASR	and harry i mean uh um i can't remember how to use my computer and things like that
UCL02a_464.158_1.26.wav_ASR	and then she suddenly noticed
UCL02a_465.465_2.41.wav_ASR	she said it wasn't a bit strange to me as well
UCL02a_468.953_0.57.wav_ASR	that's the most important
UCL02a_470.161_1.38.wav_ASR	okay
UCL02a_471.8_0.6.wav_ASR	well i thought
UCL02a_474.207_0.79.wav_ASR	it's a fish
UCL02a_475.017_1.76.wav_ASR	and working around and things like that you know
UCL02a_476.8_2.11.wav_ASR	it's still my brain is um
UCL02a_480.117_4.99.wav_ASR	but i just couldn't remember which computer was and going down stairs and things like that and that part
UCL02a_485.795_3.66.wav_ASR	and suddenly some friends had talked to me and they were talking to me
UCL02a_489.477_2.9.wav_ASR	they couldn't what they were what they were talking to me
UCL02a_494.892_2.06.wav_ASR	and then a friend of mine and then she said
UCL02a_497.05_1.56.wav_ASR	yeah we must get you sort of that as well
UCL02a_499.0_1.51.wav_ASR	and um she called
UCL02a_501.025_2.43.wav_ASR	yeah but nine o'clock and then the morning
UCL02a_503.787_2.13.wav_ASR	um we'll take over the household a. n. e.
UCL02a_507.338_1.89.wav_ASR	and i said there for a couple of times as well
UCL02a_509.25_2.01.wav_ASR	and then they're cutting from me
UCL02a_512.02_0.421.wav_ASR	that's right
UCL02a_512.456_1.29.wav_ASR	and i go straight to
UCL02a_513.77_1.31.wav_ASR	and there's some other people and
UCL02a_516.39_1.49.wav_ASR	uh the n. m. i. you go with
UCL02a_517.899_1.26.wav_ASR	yeah then i couldn't speak to her
UCL02a_519.178_1.81.wav_ASR	you have a bit of rubber rubber
UCL02a_522.583_7.091.wav_ASR	um and you know these sort of s kind of like that and things to me
UCL02a_530.449_1.74.wav_ASR	and i couldn't i couldn't speak
UCL02a_533.17_0.79.wav_ASR	i couldn't speak
UCL02a_534.844_2.64.wav_ASR	well the people were talking to me i couldn't what they were talking to me
UCL02a_537.5_1.32.wav_ASR	accidentally one word yes
UCL02a_539.744_1.17.wav_ASR	um nothing was gone
UCL02a_542.169_5.25.wav_ASR	um yeah that's right
UCL02a_547.468_1.91.wav_ASR	but that's about n that's ten in the evening as well
UCL02a_549.43_5.87.wav_ASR	so then yeah it uh north north middle sectors the first day as well
UCL02a_555.32_1.53.wav_ASR	then i said after that
UCL02a_557.638_2.43.wav_ASR	as a five or six day um hours
UCL02a_560.666_2.74.wav_ASR	and they move me from their down here to u. c. l. yeah
UCL02a_564.353_1.74.wav_ASR	um
UCL02a_568.078_5.12.wav_ASR	um and and that was it as well
UCL02a_573.219_1.35.wav_ASR	yeah i mean
UCL02a_575.827_0.89.wav_ASR	you remember after that
UCL02a_576.741_1.01.wav_ASR	it's about five hours
UCL02a_577.773_1.11.wav_ASR	that is is bit
UCL02a_579.236_0.55.wav_ASR	then we can go up
UCL02a_579.81_3.71.wav_ASR	it's quite um in the evening as well in the household
UCL02a_584.84_3.59.wav_ASR	and people would s uh want to write from the doctors and try to write from me as well
UCL02a_588.451_4.45.wav_ASR	and it could be that my speech was even worse that very early time as well
UCL02a_593.524_2.64.wav_ASR	and the next day is well i just couldn't speak over everybody
UCL02a_597.058_3.09.wav_ASR	and you mean all the hordes were there and looking at me and other peppers
UCL02a_600.25_1.04.wav_ASR	and i couldn't
UCL02a_602.917_2.26.wav_ASR	um i think i remember now
UCL02a_605.262_2.6.wav_ASR	the first the first day
UCL02a_608.048_0.74.wav_ASR	so i don't know
UCL02a_608.959_0.82.wav_ASR	it's a giraffe
UCL02a_609.799_0.88.wav_ASR	you can't just delete it
UCL02a_610.7_0.75.wav_ASR	but
UCL02a_611.467_0.48.wav_ASR	and
UCL02a_613.201_2.54.wav_ASR	um well people were talking to me
UCL02a_615.795_4.6.wav_ASR	and i couldn't i couldn't when they had talked to me i couldn't speak to anything
UCL02a_620.505_0.55.wav_ASR	it's true
UCL02a_621.961_1.52.wav_ASR	yeah they're they're writing down
UCL02a_624.359_1.26.wav_ASR	and the doctor said that that uh
UCL02a_625.666_1.39.wav_ASR	and i couldn't speak anything as well
UCL02a_628.52_4.16.wav_ASR	um that's the worst thing for about you know about it's changed by three or four weeks
UCL02a_632.699_1.28.wav_ASR	and i'm not
UCL02a_634.0_2.21.wav_ASR	oh i don't know that
UCL02a_637.869_2.91.wav_ASR	um and then after that as well
UCL02a_640.8_0.48.wav_ASR	so yeah
UCL02a_641.3_2.15.wav_ASR	so the n. v. c. is u. c. l. playing here
UCL02a_644.103_1.81.wav_ASR	and then there's play so the recording from here
UCL02a_646.0_0.38.wav_ASR	so
UCL02a_646.4_5.93.wav_ASR	the um green green s uh green green square
UCL02a_652.975_4.0.wav_ASR	the new r uh new r. t. c. r. l. c. d. screen yeah
UCL02a_657.478_1.21.wav_ASR	as far as two weeks as well
UCL02a_659.32_1.48.wav_ASR	oh that's a tuesday
UCL02a_661.705_2.51.wav_ASR	so that n that's i'm i th i mean it might not be the end of the day that
UCL02a_664.318_1.87.wav_ASR	that's the first day that have me on the first stage yeah
UCL02a_675.556_1.58.wav_ASR	that's not getting any better yeah
UCL02a_677.863_3.8.wav_ASR	um it's strange
UCL02a_681.681_3.38.wav_ASR	suppose the next thing from me i suppose about s two weeks after having
UCL02a_685.08_1.4.wav_ASR	the first s first we'll see
UCL02a_686.5_1.06.wav_ASR	oh i don't know
UCL02a_687.622_3.32.wav_ASR	and then to exist the euro euro telelogical
UCL02a_691.037_1.37.wav_ASR	can't speak the first word
UCL02a_693.677_2.17.wav_ASR	and i remember that it's the first one is about two weeks
UCL02a_695.871_6.85.wav_ASR	and then there's some people were testing me up for um like an other's fir for the um video
UCL02a_704.304_2.18.wav_ASR	and some layer was uh docked
UCL02a_706.5_3.48.wav_ASR	it's a lot of teletubbies and things like that and the i. d.
UCL02a_712.938_1.25.wav_ASR	and she sent me
UCL02a_714.208_1.77.wav_ASR	and you know these posters of me
UCL02a_716.0_3.65.wav_ASR	and are these um um yeah these are cats
UCL02a_719.666_1.46.wav_ASR	the docks and things like that
UCL02a_721.149_1.73.wav_ASR	what's this and some other things from me
UCL02a_723.85_4.47.wav_ASR	um and sometimes i couldn't what you were talking about
UCL02a_728.336_1.86.wav_ASR	yeah it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's
UCL02a_730.212_3.77.wav_ASR	there's there's a dog or n no square things and i can't remember like that
UCL02a_738.114_2.95.wav_ASR	but after that about two weeks um another place
UCL02a_741.126_4.6.wav_ASR	and then that was cool the s prototype people as well
UCL02a_747.398_2.78.wav_ASR	and the other thing was then one group of people helping up
UCL02a_750.539_5.96.wav_ASR	um straight communication people are helping people um helping me for writing some words from here as well
UCL02a_757.561_3.75.wav_ASR	um helping me some words
UCL02a_761.331_3.15.wav_ASR	like you know it's in monday tuesday wednesday friday
UCL02a_764.5_1.42.wav_ASR	the first day i couldn't tell me
UCL02a_766.211_2.02.wav_ASR	yeah it's in mando tuesday
UCL02a_768.626_0.55.wav_ASR	you could remember
UCL02a_769.252_0.9.wav_ASR	it's a good idea
UCL02a_770.176_1.63.wav_ASR	you can speak the word
UCL02a_772.961_6.7.wav_ASR	it's the first day second word third uh first day second and third four five six
UCL02a_779.679_0.83.wav_ASR	or maybe i couldn't
UCL02a_781.953_1.63.wav_ASR	um i still don't know
UCL02a_783.712_1.47.wav_ASR	it's a one two three four five eight
UCL02a_785.2_1.08.wav_ASR	you know double checked in the
UCL02a_786.37_3.78.wav_ASR	but then the first time i just told him is i couldn't speak up
UCL02a_790.171_3.41.wav_ASR	um um you know what days
UCL02a_793.6_0.79.wav_ASR	but how am i
UCL02a_795.524_1.21.wav_ASR	where you were my going
UCL02a_796.901_1.38.wav_ASR	we couldn't write what things are again
UCL02a_799.104_2.08.wav_ASR	that's difficult for me as well you know
UCL02a_801.24_3.72.wav_ASR	um there was some people i suppose f for its about
UCL02a_806.4_3.15.wav_ASR	it's about six yeah it's about six months she was there
UCL02a_810.46_2.21.wav_ASR	every week from me some lady was talking to me
UCL02a_812.693_6.05.wav_ASR	and just you know reaching some words and um helping out that that that
UCL02a_818.791_1.44.wav_ASR	that's about two weeks
UCL02a_821.718_4.68.wav_ASR	um and then after that i'd say the t. v.
UCL02a_826.419_1.74.wav_ASR	just three weeks in ta ta ta then
UCL02a_828.767_2.69.wav_ASR	my might six weeks or nine weeks
UCL02a_832.093_7.38.wav_ASR	then without a mouse and then with you at the u. c. l. or the face yeah
UCL02a_840.063_1.49.wav_ASR	that was the first test as well
UCL02a_841.662_2.74.wav_ASR	um i suppose that was that
UCL02a_845.928_4.83.wav_ASR	think for me that thing i'd i'd you know with a sponge on the top you'll just i can walk around
UCL02a_850.827_3.82.wav_ASR	oh but that's a that's a big problem for my code from me is you know things like that
UCL02a_854.716_0.61.wav_ASR	that's okay
UCL02a_856.337_3.78.wav_ASR	um you know by the bus and the couch and things like that
UCL02a_860.14_0.69.wav_ASR	oh it's a good idea
UCL02a_861.098_3.8.wav_ASR	we come up with a plan by that you know about the chip by myself
UCL02a_865.175_1.64.wav_ASR	and not being able to help people as well
UCL02a_867.837_2.54.wav_ASR	um that's a bit worrying about me
UCL02a_870.4_4.58.wav_ASR	you think our other people that with the um some people no we were the phase of peo
UCL02a_875.2_1.96.wav_ASR	if you by yourself
UCL02a_877.224_0.68.wav_ASR	we just got a half
UCL02a_878.342_1.19.wav_ASR	um it's a half an hour
UCL02a_881.28_2.41.wav_ASR	um can be wordy from me sometimes
UCL02a_883.763_1.66.wav_ASR	um i'm not much better now
UCL02a_885.443_1.45.wav_ASR	but it can be terrible you know
UCL02a_887.833_4.93.wav_ASR	um i can't speak what i'm talking about now to other people or you know
UCL02a_893.03_5.1.wav_ASR	um but i suppose after is that is better for me now
UCL02a_898.696_6.84.wav_ASR	but um yeah i mean the physically you walked around
UCL02a_905.56_0.96.wav_ASR	that's why for me
UCL02a_907.365_2.52.wav_ASR	but it's just you know it's my own brain thing as well
UCL02a_909.992_0.51.wav_ASR	uh that's it
UCL02a_911.188_1.79.wav_ASR	so it makes a sense
UCL02a_940.576_0.67.wav_ASR	so you can
UCL02a_941.493_0.61.wav_ASR	just say it again
UCL02a_942.392_1.14.wav_ASR	have to say it again
UCL02a_948.585_0.9.wav_ASR	well it's a little kid
UCL02a_955.002_2.69.wav_ASR	why don't i have a kid or why don't i have kids
UCL02a_966.107_3.03.wav_ASR	then then what d what really happened to me yeah yeah
UCL02a_971.144_7.25.wav_ASR	or doesn't make it sense so you do you you said about what but but what but what was happening to me is a kid or yeah
UCL02a_978.444_0.75.wav_ASR	oh sorry yeah
UCL02a_979.633_2.56.wav_ASR	double b by me speaking the language and things like that or no
UCL02a_986.138_3.38.wav_ASR	yeah well it's a straight away the design is quite strange
UCL02a_989.538_1.6.wav_ASR	well it's n no i'm fifty eight
UCL02a_992.535_2.48.wav_ASR	but i was a kid i was s lucky when i was kids
UCL02a_995.033_0.71.wav_ASR	it's great
UCL02a_995.761_5.8.wav_ASR	you mean our is about ten ten to thirty years it's a kid
UCL02a_1002.376_7.93.wav_ASR	and i was lucky because um i went just um i was leaving in in naples actually as a kid
UCL02a_1010.322_6.55.wav_ASR	oh it's a boring scroll in english as well but then my dad had his job out in entirely as well
UCL02a_1017.003_0.78.wav_ASR	could be better as well
UCL02a_1018.974_1.8.wav_ASR	but it's strange you talk about that things happen as well
UCL02a_1020.913_2.78.wav_ASR	but i remember i remember that was
UCL02a_1024.459_3.88.wav_ASR	they also put it in the garden as well but you know five years as well but then back to the green
UCL02a_1029.03_3.799.wav_ASR	and then back to the other half of it exactly as well
UCL02a_1033.867_3.061.wav_ASR	um and it's strange so it's a good idea
UCL02a_1038.126_1.02.wav_ASR	itinerary was wonderful
UCL02a_1039.807_0.56.wav_ASR	oh it's a cat
UCL02a_1040.387_2.99.wav_ASR	we built in napes just sort of napoleon's
UCL02a_1044.069_3.01.wav_ASR	you had a view from the um um
UCL02a_1047.13_2.44.wav_ASR	from where i was the difference you could see um
UCL02a_1053.355_0.79.wav_ASR	the v. c. s
UCL02a_1054.307_0.36.wav_ASR	okay
UCL02a_1055.824_2.03.wav_ASR	the v. u. s
UCL02a_1058.851_0.67.wav_ASR	you know that thing
UCL02a_1060.129_0.32.wav_ASR	oh right
UCL02a_1061.36_1.67.wav_ASR	versa versonese
UCL02a_1063.289_0.95.wav_ASR	it's got to be the word it has to be
UCL02a_1064.257_1.25.wav_ASR	oh the big four of us
UCL02a_1066.615_3.45.wav_ASR	um i don't know about as well
UCL02a_1070.089_2.69.wav_ASR	you well it was actually one of them
UCL02a_1072.85_4.61.wav_ASR	um okay that was good as well but we live not far down from the beach
UCL02a_1077.477_6.2.wav_ASR	but then little kid walked around and people and vulnerable food and um that's good
UCL02a_1083.7_1.68.wav_ASR	use it as a as a as a as a as a as a
UCL02a_1085.522_5.86.wav_ASR	but um um many time w uh working to other people as well
UCL02a_1091.399_3.32.wav_ASR	it's quite nice as well because they're like some other pretty piece of people as well
UCL02a_1094.81_4.37.wav_ASR	but um the screen living the menu of um electronic kits as well
UCL02a_1099.196_0.39.wav_ASR	that's right
UCL02a_1099.601_1.44.wav_ASR	it's a little kid going up there
UCL02a_1101.086_0.74.wav_ASR	oh that's a good idea
UCL02a_1102.743_1.24.wav_ASR	that was a good idea as well
UCL02a_1104.0_0.87.wav_ASR	oh i really was sorry
UCL02a_1105.801_5.43.wav_ASR	um and many times as well i remember as well it's a memory
UCL02a_1111.66_5.83.wav_ASR	but because i remember w um nee negatives we left in the other part was no there of the um
UCL02a_1119.401_0.9.wav_ASR	but
UCL02a_1122.722_0.47.wav_ASR	sorted
UCL02a_1123.837_4.04.wav_ASR	that lovely place where the um the rooms the rooms there
UCL02a_1129.177_1.12.wav_ASR	ponky pongy
UCL02a_1130.398_0.47.wav_ASR	you could
UCL02a_1131.367_2.59.wav_ASR	poppy and they're wonderful there's many times as well
UCL02a_1134.864_5.68.wav_ASR	um another one nee okay
UCL02a_1140.562_0.67.wav_ASR	and a word as well
UCL02a_1141.249_0.33.wav_ASR	it's true
UCL02a_1141.6_0.78.wav_ASR	oh it's a good idea no
UCL02a_1142.4_2.07.wav_ASR	well that's beautiful as well and going up there
UCL02a_1146.5_0.73.wav_ASR	it was difficult
UCL02a_1147.45_3.91.wav_ASR	but i don't know if this something was really good to me now or was a good in my speech
UCL02a_1151.961_1.02.wav_ASR	and a low level yeah
UCL02a_1153.0_1.95.wav_ASR	that's that was the goal in a case
UCL02a_1155.978_1.45.wav_ASR	don't mind as well but
UCL02a_1157.451_2.07.wav_ASR	you mean easily would be up to you
UCL02a_1159.847_0.73.wav_ASR	it's strange as well
UCL02a_1160.596_0.44.wav_ASR	it's a bit of a
UCL02a_1161.374_2.5.wav_ASR	yeah it's ten to but thirteen euros as far
UCL02a_1164.139_2.9.wav_ASR	then um my parents said to go back to english
UCL02a_1168.309_0.98.wav_ASR	hard disk
UCL02a_1169.391_6.21.wav_ASR	and then one i've finished going off to um university at kings here afterwards
UCL02a_1179.707_0.74.wav_ASR	so yeah it's nice
UCL02a_1180.518_1.69.wav_ASR	ten years is about ten weeks
UCL02a_1183.37_5.06.wav_ASR	is about ten years ago or just after that
UCL02a_1188.696_3.17.wav_ASR	so sixteen eight yeah that's a six
UCL02a_1192.48_1.17.wav_ASR	and i found
UCL02a_1194.89_3.13.wav_ASR	um so it's about fifteen euros as well
UCL02a_1198.222_5.16.wav_ASR	uh i found out where the old house were staying in naples and the southern bit
UCL02a_1203.403_7.26.wav_ASR	there was a kind of the um l. k. g. n. which was a little tiny vinyl out side of the panels with the very top part
UCL02a_1210.851_1.2.wav_ASR	and i found out where it was
UCL02a_1212.066_0.58.wav_ASR	it's a bit
UCL02a_1213.256_1.62.wav_ASR	little house where we living in that that
UCL02a_1214.9_1.18.wav_ASR	so it's a kid
UCL02a_1216.514_5.05.wav_ASR	there's a couple of times as well and um the whole day look around where it is and find
UCL02a_1221.964_0.68.wav_ASR	we don't know
UCL02a_1223.734_3.25.wav_ASR	um um yes quite good
UCL02a_1227.0_0.98.wav_ASR	it's quite strange
UCL02a_1228.41_4.07.wav_ASR	little thing be right as well but pop holes and things like that
UCL02a_1232.5_1.32.wav_ASR	it's a rabbit
UCL02a_1234.704_0.61.wav_ASR	it's it's it's lovely
UCL02a_1235.413_0.57.wav_ASR	that's it
UCL02a_1236.0_0.63.wav_ASR	it's not yeah
UCL02a_1236.684_1.21.wav_ASR	yeah
UCL02a_1286.807_7.87.wav_ASR	and i just want to um a working uh a writing something like that yeah
UCL02a_1294.873_1.09.wav_ASR	don't want to speech to me now
UCL02a_1305.334_0.85.wav_ASR	okay right good morning
UCL02a_1306.2_3.5.wav_ASR	as a young kid a little young um young kid
UCL02a_1309.751_1.54.wav_ASR	he's part they're playing with his foot
UCL02a_1311.308_7.67.wav_ASR	it's out in the garden not the garden but in the uh garden card yeah the garden
UCL02a_1319.06_0.68.wav_ASR	could be a good idea
UCL02a_1320.557_1.02.wav_ASR	spinning with a full power
UCL02a_1321.818_1.27.wav_ASR	oh it's a hell of a problem
UCL02a_1323.141_11.15.wav_ASR	but when he's scrolling out with his full body he massages into um a glass a window but maybe the number or what have you
UCL02a_1335.475_4.96.wav_ASR	um and he's hit a hold um in his hand
UCL02a_1340.882_4.03.wav_ASR	it's it um and the glass is bad because he smashed into his
UCL02a_1346.475_4.81.wav_ASR	then his name is then was actually that same into his house
UCL02a_1352.128_1.17.wav_ASR	his name was set up
UCL02a_1353.343_7.07.wav_ASR	and suddenly he could see that his laptop was smashed into his glass and the window
UCL02a_1361.897_3.71.wav_ASR	um so that's his number is i is name
UCL02a_1368.491_8.22.wav_ASR	and the guy who can certainly see that um he's just seen that he's can see that some has smashed into his window
UCL02a_1377.61_2.64.wav_ASR	um you can't with a little kid's and a little is no
UCL02a_1380.38_4.5.wav_ASR	but the guy can see that the fruit bowl is um missing
UCL02a_1385.553_1.45.wav_ASR	and it can't see where it is
UCL02a_1388.186_6.55.wav_ASR	but he can see obviously there's a big hole there as well in his window and his glass yeah
UCL02a_1396.458_0.67.wav_ASR	oh it's a bit
UCL02a_1438.78_0.39.wav_ASR	okay
UCL02a_1439.388_5.81.wav_ASR	um the latest is got a little um a little kid
UCL02a_1446.441_6.8.wav_ASR	um they they're out they're out with the um
UCL02a_1453.822_0.4.wav_ASR	go ahead
UCL02a_1454.398_0.82.wav_ASR	it's a rabbit
UCL02a_1456.209_0.53.wav_ASR	oh right
UCL02a_1461.232_1.39.wav_ASR	we can't speak the user voice no
UCL02a_1463.637_1.54.wav_ASR	don't just think of the spongy wood for use now
UCL02a_1469.979_2.08.wav_ASR	young one the young one with a little kid
UCL02a_1472.399_1.74.wav_ASR	and the out want to go out
UCL02a_1474.472_2.04.wav_ASR	like can't remember the english word is no
UCL02a_1476.593_1.51.wav_ASR	don't think about the spanish version
UCL02a_1483.502_1.02.wav_ASR	can't speech recognition
UCL02a_1484.68_0.42.wav_ASR	it's done
UCL02a_1491.231_0.78.wav_ASR	that's a good idea
UCL02a_1493.031_0.77.wav_ASR	indeed
UCL02a_1497.742_5.31.wav_ASR	you should call all the things with
UCL02a_1504.997_1.2.wav_ASR	you you don't think the spongy wood
UCL02a_1506.216_1.49.wav_ASR	oh it's a good idea
UCL02a_1514.282_1.22.wav_ASR	go i don't care
UCL02a_1516.067_1.7.wav_ASR	and anything the spongy word of this is fair
UCL02a_1522.5_2.45.wav_ASR	anyway little l. c. d. screen
UCL02a_1526.546_2.36.wav_ASR	the little baby kit wants to go out to the sun
UCL02a_1528.93_2.3.wav_ASR	and it and she and she goes out with her mom
UCL02a_1531.249_2.57.wav_ASR	um and it just wants to give away the um
UCL02a_1534.461_2.41.wav_ASR	yeah
UCL02a_1542.572_2.39.wav_ASR	and i don't think the spider is no it's a little thing anyway
UCL02a_1545.564_0.49.wav_ASR	oh right
UCL02a_1547.152_1.87.wav_ASR	complicated
UCL02a_1550.339_1.76.wav_ASR	oh well a little kid and you want to go out
UCL02a_1552.835_1.13.wav_ASR	little kid wants to walk
UCL02a_1554.256_5.88.wav_ASR	uh as she's going off with her little um uh rugs hard and the little baby kit
UCL02a_1560.158_1.51.wav_ASR	if you're just going out
UCL02a_1561.686_2.4.wav_ASR	then suddenly realised it got wet
UCL02a_1564.243_0.59.wav_ASR	it's a rainbow
UCL02a_1566.525_4.96.wav_ASR	little baby kid pushes back to the school because it's is pouring down with rain as well
UCL02a_1573.344_1.59.wav_ASR	and you can have to go back in again
UCL02a_1575.035_1.04.wav_ASR	can you speak to my mom
UCL02a_1576.189_5.16.wav_ASR	and then she can see the little baby doctor is she's really wet and poor and and poor with rain
UCL02a_1581.364_2.38.wav_ASR	it's just back there as well
UCL02a_1585.185_1.78.wav_ASR	and now you can't remember what uh
UCL02a_1587.492_1.17.wav_ASR	oh yeah it's almost the word as well
UCL02a_1591.198_3.82.wav_ASR	the rabbit rabbit rabbit
UCL02a_1595.096_0.87.wav_ASR	yes i remember the
UCL02a_1595.987_1.45.wav_ASR	it's
UCL02a_1597.647_1.62.wav_ASR	you can think of the spongy wood as well
UCL02a_1601.498_1.28.wav_ASR	april a april
UCL02a_1602.8_0.8.wav_ASR	yeah that's it
UCL02a_1604.012_7.42.wav_ASR	so the little baby kid um um um as now got a a a better half after all
UCL02a_1611.536_5.11.wav_ASR	and she's now that little stop i got getting weight because it was ranging a lot for last time i suppose as well yeah
UCL02a_1617.557_1.16.wav_ASR	yeah
UCL02a_1618.733_0.41.wav_ASR	remember
UCL02a_1619.809_1.47.wav_ASR	or a brain a brain
UCL02a_1621.474_1.83.wav_ASR	kinda think the spanish words as well as the
UCL02a_1624.323_1.51.wav_ASR	but i want to think about the spongy one
UCL02a_1625.854_0.58.wav_ASR	alrighty
UCL02a_1626.911_1.15.wav_ASR	so it's difficult
UCL02a_1629.167_0.95.wav_ASR	that's a good idea
UCL02a_1631.164_1.42.wav_ASR	so sorry one word you just couldn't remember
UCL02a_1660.531_1.79.wav_ASR	for just tell what's been happening now yeah
UCL02a_1671.515_0.47.wav_ASR	computer
UCL02a_1672.334_0.67.wav_ASR	so much better
UCL02a_1673.054_4.99.wav_ASR	it's like one's a little coda little things is it
UCL02a_1678.595_1.87.wav_ASR	everything is already hard disk as well
UCL02a_1681.017_1.0.wav_ASR	okay right
UCL02a_1682.541_6.58.wav_ASR	first of all that's a little push cat is out in the um up in the tree and the top part of the of the tree
UCL02a_1690.202_4.11.wav_ASR	there's a little baby cat in the very top of the tree and can't get to sleep
UCL02a_1694.327_9.2.wav_ASR	um and j and j. g. c. and the cat cannot get into the tree because the cat is in the tree in calmer wood
UCL02a_1703.696_1.84.wav_ASR	and a little bit can see the cat
UCL02a_1705.555_3.09.wav_ASR	and she's happy happy but the cat can't get to sleep as well
UCL02a_1710.048_8.58.wav_ASR	little baby kids um it's the baby girls she's forgetting which is out with her um uh a thrill
UCL02a_1719.566_0.85.wav_ASR	oh come on the wood now
UCL02a_1723.364_0.76.wav_ASR	is it a good idea then
UCL02a_1724.26_1.49.wav_ASR	think the some guys is being helped up
UCL02a_1726.06_7.38.wav_ASR	he's he's he's going to help he's going to help this guy this man is gonna help with the cat
UCL02a_1735.207_4.01.wav_ASR	and then it's gonna help to help the cat out of the tree
UCL02a_1739.86_3.97.wav_ASR	but then there's a big no a big dog but it's making a lot of noise
UCL02a_1744.072_2.85.wav_ASR	it's it's it's a bit scared for the guy outside
UCL02a_1748.204_1.99.wav_ASR	so the man is up there trying to help with the cat
UCL02a_1751.24_6.61.wav_ASR	um but the other big dog is um making a bit problem from as well
UCL02a_1759.276_15.77.wav_ASR	and top of him as well i imagine he's helped the um the um help to the uh no no no
UCL02a_1775.511_1.42.wav_ASR	yeah
UCL02a_1779.96_5.2.wav_ASR	um
UCL02a_1787.629_1.09.wav_ASR	got all these kids
UCL02a_1789.188_6.61.wav_ASR	um i'm not gonna lie d uh
UCL02a_1795.817_0.59.wav_ASR	and i can
UCL02a_1798.365_1.05.wav_ASR	these young people was well
UCL02a_1800.445_6.73.wav_ASR	with the um yellow peels will help them when they got a problem so with the n. e. n. e. no with the um
UCL02a_1808.09_0.81.wav_ASR	well the hour
UCL02a_1809.637_0.71.wav_ASR	can't eat it no
UCL02a_1810.4_0.33.wav_ASR	it's a two
UCL02a_1813.715_0.45.wav_ASR	oh well
UCL02a_1814.315_3.93.wav_ASR	well that's not hurting today it's well like a little baby doctor little girls
UCL02a_1818.266_3.66.wav_ASR	she's lost where s her cats and the very top of the tree can't mind where are we
UCL02a_1822.322_4.06.wav_ASR	the mouse is gonna help 'em help the cat getting out of the tree
UCL02a_1826.967_6.29.wav_ASR	the big dog is uh barking and making the man in front of it all
UCL02a_1834.028_2.73.wav_ASR	it's got um um
UCL02a_1837.122_0.94.wav_ASR	don't worry
UCL02a_1838.587_1.15.wav_ASR	and i can't remember that as well
UCL02a_1841.049_1.1.wav_ASR	and my dear
UCL02a_1842.585_1.87.wav_ASR	can't think that now
UCL02a_1853.342_0.91.wav_ASR	that's right
UCL02a_1855.108_0.31.wav_ASR	it's not good
UCL02a_1855.54_0.88.wav_ASR	but i can't
UCL02a_1856.441_0.59.wav_ASR	it's difficult isn't it
UCL02a_1863.145_1.0.wav_ASR	make it go
UCL02a_1864.36_1.21.wav_ASR	you just go for that one as well
UCL02a_1866.475_1.31.wav_ASR	and i called the word in english
UCL02a_1867.995_0.5.wav_ASR	had a t. v.
UCL02a_1868.985_1.68.wav_ASR	and i don't think about the wood is no
UCL02a_1872.015_0.81.wav_ASR	okay
UCL02a_1873.207_1.22.wav_ASR	yeah
UCL02a_1874.704_0.53.wav_ASR	you just mind
UCL02a_1875.352_2.46.wav_ASR	but w but but what's the what's the what's the what's that called
UCL02a_1884.456_1.58.wav_ASR	you something like that
UCL02a_1886.054_1.08.wav_ASR	oh sorry it's gone
UCL02a_1887.659_0.43.wav_ASR	doesn't matter
UCL02a_1888.719_0.43.wav_ASR	it's just go
UCL02a_1890.493_0.6.wav_ASR	so isn't
UCL02a_1891.213_0.45.wav_ASR	but that's right
UCL02a_1901.902_3.39.wav_ASR	sendi sendi uh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
UCL02a_1907.842_7.14.wav_ASR	yeah but i dunno about the the um the big fat folders and l. s. r. people uh
UCL02a_1915.0_6.3.wav_ASR	and she leaves her um a glass um
UCL02a_1924.744_0.52.wav_ASR	oh
UCL02a_2128.22_0.79.wav_ASR	but i can remember now
UCL02a_2131.784_1.53.wav_ASR	um yeah of course
UCL02a_2133.333_2.44.wav_ASR	there's there's there's some too little keys there's well
UCL02a_2135.819_1.63.wav_ASR	and then um come up with their oh
UCL02a_2137.5_1.95.wav_ASR	well i don't know if that's two money in there as well
UCL02a_2139.799_0.94.wav_ASR	acronyms
UCL02a_2141.248_2.33.wav_ASR	the older
UCL02a_2143.602_12.55.wav_ASR	anyway um there's a two ugly doctors as well directors are staying there as well
UCL02a_2156.6_11.55.wav_ASR	and um the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two
UCL02a_2168.498_1.21.wav_ASR	and the girls says wow
UCL02a_2171.895_3.09.wav_ASR	and then there's send or uh
UCL02a_2175.075_1.21.wav_ASR	that is helping as well
UCL02a_2176.3_2.6.wav_ASR	is cleaning up and all the stuff that that that
UCL02a_2179.266_4.97.wav_ASR	 anyway the two rasting um the two layers they're pretty obvious
UCL02a_2184.506_6.38.wav_ASR	they see that there's a letter has arrived from people that the price is gonna help everybody for the for the ball
UCL02a_2192.261_7.4.wav_ASR	um and the two um the upper ledges are going over there now as well
UCL02a_2200.823_3.21.wav_ASR	um
UCL02a_2209.14_6.81.wav_ASR	and sender i remember the sender was out to help some people as well to helping her
UCL02a_2216.0_2.47.wav_ASR	was it the sort of um the furry gonna come around
UCL02a_2218.526_0.53.wav_ASR	carbomb
UCL02a_2220.164_2.64.wav_ASR	so it's gonna help us to go to the ball as well
UCL02a_2224.416_2.14.wav_ASR	um anyway i come up with your head
UCL02a_2226.919_5.81.wav_ASR	but she was going to um the magic for going to the border itself
UCL02a_2233.872_6.43.wav_ASR	and um
UCL02a_2245.056_1.15.wav_ASR	the power's just curved as well
UCL02a_2246.267_0.75.wav_ASR	okay
UCL02a_2253.207_0.99.wav_ASR	that's the giraffe
UCL02a_2259.656_0.32.wav_ASR	so
UCL02a_2260.0_0.34.wav_ASR	it's good
UCL02a_2260.628_0.37.wav_ASR	still
UCL02a_2270.759_1.41.wav_ASR	goed
UCL02a_2277.844_0.82.wav_ASR	yeah but yeah
UCL02a_2288.142_1.14.wav_ASR	but th yeah
UCL02a_2289.299_3.99.wav_ASR	and then it has to go away because she has to get away by the side just by mid night
UCL02a_2294.461_1.89.wav_ASR	and it has to get away there really quickly as well
UCL02a_2296.597_1.87.wav_ASR	you know she saw the print
UCL02a_2298.956_0.75.wav_ASR	print so hard
UCL02a_2299.721_3.63.wav_ASR	and uh he looked the look of channel ones and that that that
UCL02a_2303.491_1.06.wav_ASR	he likes the look of it as well
UCL02a_2305.795_2.77.wav_ASR	and then you had to run over really quickly before it's mid night
UCL02a_2308.802_3.26.wav_ASR	and she forgot about her her shoe the last shoe
UCL02a_2312.503_0.93.wav_ASR	yeah
UCL02a_2315.122_5.4.wav_ASR	cinetis cinderella then it had to just um um by the self because she was
UCL02a_2320.537_2.92.wav_ASR	it's like a sort of um um magnetic
UCL02a_2323.479_3.38.wav_ASR	it has to back to her how old place as well
UCL02a_2328.309_13.82.wav_ASR	um anyway the print remember that the print could see that the the print could see that the sinderer had forgotten where her shoe is the glass thing is wrong
UCL02a_2342.76_4.03.wav_ASR	the price says he really likes the look of her and wants to get married for all the stuff
UCL02a_2347.588_11.36.wav_ASR	it's it's gone around to asking everybody where this where this um sinadar uh where he lives there
UCL02a_2359.0_1.34.wav_ASR	just to find out where you wanted to find a way
UCL02a_2362.313_2.13.wav_ASR	because she looks the perfect one for his wife
UCL02a_2365.908_2.95.wav_ASR	and that's what the print file looks everywhere everywhere
UCL02a_2368.879_2.49.wav_ASR	going to to other places where she could be there
UCL02a_2372.247_6.9.wav_ASR	and the print and other people's can see that sign red uh is out there
UCL02a_2379.2_12.09.wav_ASR	and they can see that his shoe that his foot um fits her uh glasses her shoe
UCL02a_2392.008_0.94.wav_ASR	yeah yeah yeah yeah
UCL02a_2394.518_4.55.wav_ASR	and the print can see that it's c. d. that they can um oh
UCL02a_2411.581_6.95.wav_ASR	just remember where what the print could remember where she is and then um
UCL02a_2420.923_0.74.wav_ASR	so it's a good
UCL02a_2422.016_0.68.wav_ASR	so that's right
UCL02a_2423.335_0.34.wav_ASR	it's come
UCL02a_2426.449_2.3.wav_ASR	the very ingrid is something that's a little bit like i can't remember
UCL02a_2429.006_5.3.wav_ASR	the other thing is where was the um where was the print
UCL02a_2441.692_0.88.wav_ASR	sliding window
UCL02a_2442.701_0.4.wav_ASR	it's a go
UCL02a_2443.78_1.25.wav_ASR	you may be able to
UCL02a_2445.13_1.09.wav_ASR	so
UCL02a_2447.15_1.16.wav_ASR	how do my shoes as well

whiteside15a_1654.555_1.91.wav_ASR	and then you
williamson08a_2.291_0.43.wav_ASR	okay
williamson08a_11.874_5.03.wav_ASR	um it's definitely getting better
williamson08a_17.679_4.89.wav_ASR	but um i still have a long way to go
williamson08a_24.352_9.16.wav_ASR	um so um i my biggest obstacle is reading
williamson08a_34.213_4.5.wav_ASR	um i i can't read like at all
williamson08a_39.832_7.46.wav_ASR	um and so um my herpetes is helping me
williamson08a_47.822_15.12.wav_ASR	um so um i do um i do like it's a uh it's um
williamson08a_67.45_4.92.wav_ASR	so it's two different things together
williamson08a_72.823_10.58.wav_ASR	um and but it's basically you re um a hunderd words
williamson08a_84.098_6.36.wav_ASR	um and you practiced every two times a day
williamson08a_122.784_0.46.wav_ASR	so yeah
williamson08a_123.785_2.69.wav_ASR	so i practiced it
williamson08a_126.606_2.34.wav_ASR	and i mean i'm getting better
williamson08a_128.995_7.06.wav_ASR	but um i uh for me like i would love to read
williamson08a_137.197_6.33.wav_ASR	um but i just it's like a disconnected you know
williamson08a_143.796_1.68.wav_ASR	and i really don't know
williamson08a_145.543_4.64.wav_ASR	and i mean i think obviously i'll be able to do it but i just really have no idea

williamson08a_737.298_0.71.wav_ASR	be fine
williamson08a_738.145_0.82.wav_ASR	oh worry about
williamson08a_740.922_5.04.wav_ASR	and so um so he went to school

williamson08a_751.94_6.44.wav_ASR	and and it just kept running
williamson08a_758.839_5.98.wav_ASR	and then it actually went um side ways
williamson08a_765.72_17.3.wav_ASR	and so um so when he um so he went back and said to the woman
williamson08a_818.127_5.96.wav_ASR	and so he or so she got an opener
williamson08a_824.134_4.29.wav_ASR	and then she or he went um to scroll

williamson08a_1178.21_0.43.wav_ASR	okay
williamson08a_1178.759_1.91.wav_ASR	so um
williamson08a_1184.163_0.64.wav_ASR	uh-huh
williamson08a_1185.0_0.39.wav_ASR	oh okay
williamson08a_1186.121_0.68.wav_ASR	what
williamson08a_1189.008_1.73.wav_ASR	the sanderer i think
williamson08a_1192.008_0.54.wav_ASR	terra
williamson08a_1194.661_0.35.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
williamson08a_1195.557_7.74.wav_ASR	so uh um
williamson08a_1207.698_20.13.wav_ASR	so um
williamson08a_1229.492_2.46.wav_ASR	so um
williamson08a_1236.903_0.65.wav_ASR	yeah
williamson08a_1242.727_13.09.wav_ASR	um so
williamson08a_1255.896_0.46.wav_ASR	oh
williamson08a_1258.193_0.59.wav_ASR	yeah
williamson08a_1260.878_18.78.wav_ASR	uh so 'cause there were um there were four um there were four um there were four um goals right
williamson08a_1280.679_0.38.wav_ASR	yeah
williamson08a_1281.459_9.91.wav_ASR	um so there were three girls that were very poor
williamson08a_1291.751_6.82.wav_ASR	and then the um sender uh was like a slide basically
williamson08a_1299.967_20.73.wav_ASR	and um so she um did all the trials and you know um just everything
williamson08a_1359.082_27.2.wav_ASR	and it said that um they are going to have a ball and um and because um they are or um the price needs a mate

williamson14a_857.068_3.71.wav_ASR	um and he run r ran away
williamson14a_862.067_4.68.wav_ASR	and it's in the s the the sharp and stuff like that
williamson14a_868.396_4.57.wav_ASR	but the uh but the the price was uh there
williamson14a_873.563_2.15.wav_ASR	and he uh in short in short
williamson14a_876.305_1.65.wav_ASR	and he s the speakers
williamson14a_879.55_10.91.wav_ASR	and he um and he the step daughter the step daughter
williamson14a_890.718_1.91.wav_ASR	now they were s too heavy
williamson14a_893.155_7.16.wav_ASR	but centre colour was just one i mean just uh the splinters
williamson14a_901.097_1.4.wav_ASR	and
williamson14a_902.685_1.44.wav_ASR	so he married
williamson14a_904.669_2.65.wav_ASR	in a t. v.
williamson14a_909.93_2.86.wav_ASR	now no but i'm yes uh but the the boy
williamson14a_917.394_0.59.wav_ASR	oh okay

williamson14a_981.548_1.01.wav_ASR	kid not too bad
williamson14b_10.082_0.87.wav_ASR	oh very good
williamson14b_11.338_1.95.wav_ASR	yeah not bad but good
williamson14b_17.271_0.59.wav_ASR	yes i did
williamson14b_19.939_0.67.wav_ASR	yes i did
williamson14b_21.942_0.45.wav_ASR	uh-huh
williamson14b_22.964_5.92.wav_ASR	it was two thousand
williamson14b_33.931_0.34.wav_ASR	oh yeah
williamson14b_34.826_0.62.wav_ASR	yeah
williamson14b_37.148_8.77.wav_ASR	well uh uh it was uh four a. a. m.
williamson14b_46.762_0.88.wav_ASR	had a strawberry
williamson14b_55.66_4.59.wav_ASR	and uh i i was conscious you know
williamson14b_61.054_1.43.wav_ASR	and uh the elements
williamson14b_63.372_5.97.wav_ASR	and a and a and um
williamson14b_70.972_5.8.wav_ASR	four oops you rush to the the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the

williamson14b_84.323_4.17.wav_ASR	terra tera's household uh was there
williamson14b_89.267_0.85.wav_ASR	yeah
williamson14b_94.697_13.51.wav_ASR	and there was uh and then uh and a and a month to uh to uh the ambiguity again in uh uh montaren household as well
williamson14b_109.533_0.61.wav_ASR	and
williamson14b_115.291_0.49.wav_ASR	yeah
williamson14b_125.074_4.61.wav_ASR	well uh to the household uh um
williamson14b_133.148_3.6.wav_ASR	yeah i i was standing
williamson14b_137.17_10.9.wav_ASR	and um and uh and my uh my daughter uh was um there
williamson14b_149.375_9.03.wav_ASR	and uh it was three years and uh the drawing it was very good uh test you know
williamson14b_159.171_1.17.wav_ASR	it's a process
williamson14b_160.539_1.64.wav_ASR	the pen is the pen is the pen is the pen is the pen is the pen is the pen is the pen
williamson14b_163.793_0.45.wav_ASR	yes
williamson14b_166.018_1.22.wav_ASR	but now i did it no
williamson14b_168.229_1.4.wav_ASR	it was uh oh it was uh
williamson14b_171.399_3.63.wav_ASR	and then um a hery
williamson14b_175.879_1.31.wav_ASR	you go there
williamson14b_178.096_1.13.wav_ASR	but he almost died
williamson14b_181.265_5.76.wav_ASR	now but the lag is it was n it was worse
williamson14b_187.576_0.69.wav_ASR	it was worse
williamson14b_189.462_4.449.wav_ASR	actually uh i mean it's two years ago
williamson14b_194.226_1.71.wav_ASR	and then you f gradually it's better
williamson14b_199.03_0.41.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
williamson14b_209.557_2.5.wav_ASR	well not really i mean here
williamson14b_212.545_0.45.wav_ASR	or sh yeah
williamson14b_214.958_5.93.wav_ASR	yes well not really but uh um i used to be uh in pen state
williamson14b_221.477_2.1.wav_ASR	there was a uh uh recognition
williamson14b_225.18_1.22.wav_ASR	it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a
williamson14b_226.85_0.72.wav_ASR	and it's a fruit
williamson14b_227.813_1.21.wav_ASR	it was really frustrating
williamson14b_229.946_1.14.wav_ASR	it was really something
williamson14b_232.539_4.17.wav_ASR	but i stayed uh two years ago
williamson14b_237.274_2.62.wav_ASR	and then and then the centre
williamson14b_243.689_0.54.wav_ASR	yeah it is
williamson14b_244.393_0.43.wav_ASR	yeah that's it
williamson14b_264.492_6.88.wav_ASR	well the b boy uh uh the the boy who was kicking the the
williamson14b_272.629_8.16.wav_ASR	and he and um and the window was pushed over
williamson14b_282.184_6.87.wav_ASR	and uh and the and the customer uh the the man
williamson14b_293.137_5.11.wav_ASR	and a um block the window
williamson14b_299.025_0.81.wav_ASR	and the ball
williamson14b_301.44_6.12.wav_ASR	and uh was uh was broken
williamson14b_338.753_0.38.wav_ASR	okay
williamson14b_341.736_8.15.wav_ASR	um the the uh the better and uh and the um the boy
williamson14b_350.997_10.55.wav_ASR	uh he was uh he was uh he didn't want to go
williamson14b_362.719_1.3.wav_ASR	so he said
williamson14b_364.141_0.45.wav_ASR	now
williamson14b_366.146_0.57.wav_ASR	it's okay
williamson14b_368.248_2.69.wav_ASR	but uh it was porridge porridge
williamson14b_372.461_2.6.wav_ASR	and it was unfortunately poor
williamson14b_376.316_9.12.wav_ASR	and uh and the and the and the uh the mother and the uh the child and the uh child was mad
williamson14b_386.363_3.22.wav_ASR	now he's uh the amber
williamson14b_425.681_5.43.wav_ASR	well the girl was uh on the tree with a cat
williamson14b_432.745_11.37.wav_ASR	so uh uh the the the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the
williamson14b_445.209_4.06.wav_ASR	but the dog was helping
williamson14b_450.994_7.45.wav_ASR	so so we uh took the the fire and rejected 'em
williamson14b_468.993_0.4.wav_ASR	yes
williamson14b_472.298_0.41.wav_ASR	it's true
williamson14b_615.236_0.5.wav_ASR	okay
williamson14b_616.869_17.51.wav_ASR	uh the step uh most uh and uh the the z. i. beautiful uh uh two uh dollars and uh his uh his wife and uh his daughter and uh his mother and uh his w his wife
williamson14b_636.075_2.8.wav_ASR	and he uh arranged the the matter
williamson14b_640.322_10.39.wav_ASR	but the the step daughter was really not didn't it was uh generally because of the two curves because of the two corners because of the two curves
williamson14b_652.237_17.68.wav_ASR	so uh he's looking and cleaning and uh but the the the uh the the uh the the z. i. beautiful why i mean uh the the the uh the the size would be uh hand in and foot to be there
williamson14b_670.99_4.72.wav_ASR	so um so uh he um there was a border
williamson14b_676.799_3.41.wav_ASR	uh and uh the the white was stayed at home
williamson14b_681.131_8.97.wav_ASR	and the sammy's mm beautiful uh uh uh da da or was uh in the ball
williamson14b_692.195_7.59.wav_ASR	and um but the favourite uh the very god morah said uh uh uh uh
williamson14b_701.684_0.96.wav_ASR	and the penguin
williamson14b_703.542_0.86.wav_ASR	and uh
williamson14b_704.519_3.35.wav_ASR	you're going to the th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th
williamson14b_709.28_3.02.wav_ASR	so we uh dress her up
williamson14b_713.72_1.57.wav_ASR	and uh it was a beautiful place
williamson14b_716.572_2.52.wav_ASR	and he uh stepped uh the standards
williamson14b_720.042_3.19.wav_ASR	and uh the the process uh there
williamson14b_724.086_1.33.wav_ASR	and a two hardware
williamson14b_726.718_21.63.wav_ASR	so um but now uh twelve thirty uh he the ponging was uh uh he was um the spongy was uh there
williamson14b_748.729_7.69.wav_ASR	but uh uh and it changed it to the the wide horse to i uh the mouse
williamson14b_757.621_9.63.wav_ASR	and uh and and and the uh and and and the and uh and and and the shoe
williamson14b_769.62_5.48.wav_ASR	so he uh but he was concerned about the the white
williamson14b_775.983_3.85.wav_ASR	and then the uh uh the um sender
williamson14b_781.32_1.35.wav_ASR	so he said
williamson14b_783.562_0.73.wav_ASR	it was a shoe
williamson14b_786.17_1.28.wav_ASR	oh where is the shoe
williamson14b_789.337_12.67.wav_ASR	so i think there was the um uh the uh the the the press but the the the the the text
williamson14b_802.032_4.61.wav_ASR	oh right what the l. c. d. is but
williamson14b_807.41_1.07.wav_ASR	and he goes around
williamson14b_808.55_4.17.wav_ASR	um and he it i it was the one uh the the splitter
williamson14b_814.419_0.66.wav_ASR	so we found
williamson14b_815.879_0.86.wav_ASR	and that's the end
williamson14b_829.716_5.57.wav_ASR	well mm there's a two piece of red
williamson14b_837.105_2.76.wav_ASR	open the uh the the cell phone
williamson14b_841.519_2.78.wav_ASR	and uh two pieces of red
williamson14b_847.059_12.67.wav_ASR	um and uh and uh one the the red and the other the brown and the other the bottom was the red
williamson14b_860.221_4.83.wav_ASR	and the uh the digits i mean the the plate was there
williamson14b_867.227_10.49.wav_ASR	so he um mm the piranha uh was um the giraffe uh was um the giraffe
williamson14b_879.138_1.62.wav_ASR	and uh uh the hand
williamson14b_881.397_6.09.wav_ASR	and the uh in the panther bar uh and gelat and uh
williamson14b_887.509_0.62.wav_ASR	uh
williamson14b_888.286_21.9.wav_ASR	um the um the um the um the um
williamson14b_910.888_10.49.wav_ASR	and the and the glass
williamson14b_921.962_6.41.wav_ASR	and and um the pen was there
williamson14b_930.798_2.17.wav_ASR	and uh and a nice
williamson14b_934.477_2.21.wav_ASR	and uh spread it around
williamson14b_938.003_3.4.wav_ASR	and uh make a some uh pineapple
williamson14b_943.261_0.32.wav_ASR	alright
wright204a_21.326_0.39.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_33.919_2.51.wav_ASR	oh it it comes and goes
wright204a_36.502_8.6.wav_ASR	by that i mean uh normally i can i can get things but then there are times when i can't get the words out
wright204a_46.058_5.75.wav_ASR	so then i have to either try them or s
wright204a_52.361_3.35.wav_ASR	half the time i i get it and sometimes i do
wright204a_70.687_0.41.wav_ASR	yes
wright204a_72.596_8.66.wav_ASR	it was uh number the fifth nine ten i uh eight five six seven eight
wright204a_83.112_2.56.wav_ASR	it was right after uh umbrellas collection
wright204a_87.358_3.86.wav_ASR	and uh i actually designed it
wright204a_91.931_2.52.wav_ASR	decided that it was something was wrong with me
wright204a_94.5_1.48.wav_ASR	it was about five or a clock
wright204a_96.693_17.35.wav_ASR	and uh i yeah i actually s before i said anything to my wife i want to uh uh computer to
wright204a_116.296_6.93.wav_ASR	uh it was the was a was double you
wright204a_125.236_1.64.wav_ASR	the doctors thing you know
wright204a_127.587_1.32.wav_ASR	yeah i got a draw
wright204a_129.639_0.521.wav_ASR	yeah that's right
wright204a_131.354_1.07.wav_ASR	think i have a store
wright204a_132.539_1.42.wav_ASR	and i went in and told my wife
wright204a_135.675_8.74.wav_ASR	he was really because my mother in law had one noticed that i had a little bit of swallow and yeah
wright204a_144.878_3.05.wav_ASR	so she immediately called the
wright204a_148.982_0.93.wav_ASR	yeah
wright204a_150.235_2.4.wav_ASR	well they're doing that i gotta get dressed right
wright204a_153.306_1.62.wav_ASR	had my short card
wright204a_154.992_4.06.wav_ASR	had to put a pear of hands on to go to the storage right
wright204a_161.391_1.24.wav_ASR	yeah so i did
wright204a_163.103_1.76.wav_ASR	uh the batteries came up
wright204a_165.426_1.7.wav_ASR	ah and i said
wright204a_168.011_1.22.wav_ASR	think i'm having a stroke
wright204a_169.941_1.47.wav_ASR	and they looked at me
wright204a_171.523_2.04.wav_ASR	and then they looked at me again
wright204a_173.581_0.4.wav_ASR	and
wright204a_174.146_0.86.wav_ASR	you think you're right
wright204a_176.302_1.03.wav_ASR	so we made
wright204a_177.886_0.79.wav_ASR	everything was fine
wright204a_178.771_1.52.wav_ASR	we were still a way
wright204a_180.306_1.01.wav_ASR	everything was great
wright204a_182.077_6.1.wav_ASR	and that's after go going on in the uh ambiguity i sort of don't remember
wright204a_193.108_0.34.wav_ASR	well
wright204a_196.357_2.49.wav_ASR	well this is a strong that's a leading strength
wright204a_200.509_1.51.wav_ASR	that was that was the kind of
wright204a_202.822_0.7.wav_ASR	yes right
wright204a_204.132_3.8.wav_ASR	which i understand is a little bit less than half
wright204a_208.966_0.67.wav_ASR	that was me
wright204a_210.501_0.9.wav_ASR	it's one of the luckiest
wright204a_212.664_5.3.wav_ASR	and uh i uh i was in three different habitats
wright204a_218.922_5.15.wav_ASR	and uh really didn't come out of anything until about
wright204a_225.73_0.45.wav_ASR	oh i see
wright204a_227.123_9.64.wav_ASR	we would say the middle of december just before christmas oh yeah it's when i remember f for the first time
wright204a_238.834_1.62.wav_ASR	it was out for a lot of time
wright204a_240.614_4.38.wav_ASR	you had all kinds of tests and
wright204a_247.286_2.71.wav_ASR	uh two or three uh i'm a r. i. d.
wright204a_250.143_1.63.wav_ASR	oh
wright204a_252.388_1.03.wav_ASR	think that's what they call
wright204a_255.308_1.49.wav_ASR	shame it put it
wright204a_258.047_5.38.wav_ASR	oh and uh from then on then i was at berger's
wright204a_263.563_11.04.wav_ASR	yeah i remember all the wires where i had all three of uh things for uh speech uh
wright204a_285.874_1.82.wav_ASR	well i i'm a lot slower
wright204a_288.289_6.62.wav_ASR	ah yeah i had to learn to use more of my left hand then i wanted to
wright204a_295.072_5.09.wav_ASR	but i can't i was persuaded on the whole right side
wright204a_301.173_1.18.wav_ASR	for quite a long time
wright204a_303.069_4.89.wav_ASR	oh when i got out of the household for the third time i was in a wheel chair
wright204a_315.318_2.19.wav_ASR	now they're all all
wright204a_318.564_0.31.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_319.489_15.42.wav_ASR	so uh really from o the dember of o. eight through about the end of the end of the week i was in the house
wright204a_337.032_3.05.wav_ASR	so 'cause we had different problems
wright204a_340.132_1.81.wav_ASR	uh i had to
wright204a_343.379_4.39.wav_ASR	and i had uh some other kind of things that i w i don't even remember
wright204a_348.779_3.78.wav_ASR	and so it it took a long time just to get out of the hubble
wright204a_353.142_6.05.wav_ASR	but i was home uh in uh december
wright204a_360.553_13.81.wav_ASR	cherry orange fruit s no third i started outtery at uh china channel original holiday over in china
wright204a_375.474_6.3.wav_ASR	oh oh i've been there with the r. s. i.
wright204a_391.134_0.65.wav_ASR	that's correct
wright204a_400.899_0.38.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_423.934_1.43.wav_ASR	just
wright204a_426.385_3.17.wav_ASR	yeah i had a very good like good life
wright204a_430.939_2.71.wav_ASR	oh
wright204a_434.419_0.39.wav_ASR	very
wright204a_435.869_1.32.wav_ASR	yeah it's a giraffe
wright204a_437.931_2.89.wav_ASR	uh my first child was a big event
wright204a_441.696_4.35.wav_ASR	oh my second third and fourth channels
wright204a_448.445_4.81.wav_ASR	we just had our fifteen anniversary oh this past uh
wright204a_454.55_4.98.wav_ASR	well it'll be a year and in in market apple apple apple
wright204a_460.255_1.8.wav_ASR	you are our first fifty per hour
wright204a_462.698_3.202.wav_ASR	oh there's there's lots of things
wright204a_466.905_2.09.wav_ASR	uh yeah had a good life as a child
wright204a_469.055_1.22.wav_ASR	it was an only child
wright204a_471.226_6.03.wav_ASR	oh i don't know what to say
wright204a_488.482_2.61.wav_ASR	yeah
wright204a_551.677_4.2.wav_ASR	little boy is playing with a circle ball i guess
wright204a_556.512_3.27.wav_ASR	and he happens to hit the window
wright204a_562.435_1.63.wav_ASR	and it goes in
wright204a_564.087_8.98.wav_ASR	you need to it uh the guy inside is is in the in the in the picture is sitting down
wright204a_573.142_3.66.wav_ASR	and it hits them i guess or at least it comes in the window
wright204a_577.402_1.19.wav_ASR	so we've got classics
wright204a_579.694_1.82.wav_ASR	and uh he goes
wright204a_581.882_2.06.wav_ASR	he looks at the window
wright204a_583.994_0.79.wav_ASR	he has the ball
wright204a_584.804_8.2.wav_ASR	and apparently he's going out to see what happened and maybe let the ball uh go back to the digital child
wright204a_611.342_0.53.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_612.361_1.49.wav_ASR	looks like it's ready for scroll
wright204a_614.634_3.67.wav_ASR	he's s says looks like he might want to take the embryo
wright204a_619.559_2.09.wav_ASR	you s probably just said okay
wright204a_623.716_0.88.wav_ASR	did she say
wright204a_625.692_0.59.wav_ASR	maybe not
wright204a_626.402_0.35.wav_ASR	don't know
wright204a_626.8_2.35.wav_ASR	because now he's going to school
wright204a_629.803_0.94.wav_ASR	oh no it isn't
wright204a_630.763_0.47.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_633.482_1.14.wav_ASR	it's
wright204a_634.899_1.17.wav_ASR	oh i don't think i need it
wright204a_637.004_1.53.wav_ASR	ah
wright204a_639.482_1.63.wav_ASR	and he must be waiting for the bus
wright204a_641.129_1.2.wav_ASR	and it's a good idea
wright204a_642.924_2.12.wav_ASR	so now it's coming down pretty good
wright204a_645.498_1.72.wav_ASR	so he's goes back to the house
wright204a_647.796_0.36.wav_ASR	you don't
wright204a_648.654_0.66.wav_ASR	oh well that's right
wright204a_650.019_0.33.wav_ASR	and
wright204a_651.289_1.3.wav_ASR	yeah i'd be a good idea to take the ipod
wright204a_672.485_0.54.wav_ASR	let's see
wright204a_677.959_4.91.wav_ASR	looks like the problem is the cat is stuck up in a tree
wright204a_683.65_0.4.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_685.27_2.21.wav_ASR	oh there is how on the
wright204a_687.552_3.18.wav_ASR	oh and he's kind of stuck himself i think
wright204a_691.424_2.46.wav_ASR	oh the little girl is crying for the cat
wright204a_694.509_1.57.wav_ASR	oh
wright204a_696.668_4.34.wav_ASR	there's a there's a guy up on the t uh a dog barking up the tree
wright204a_701.845_1.46.wav_ASR	the fire department is coming
wright204a_703.403_5.75.wav_ASR	the little girl was trying to was w was trying to reach it i guess
wright204a_709.619_2.69.wav_ASR	don't know if she was trying to get this letter or not
wright204a_712.623_1.35.wav_ASR	and no idea about that
wright204a_715.021_2.4.wav_ASR	oh
wright204a_717.541_1.03.wav_ASR	wireless charger is there
wright204a_718.865_6.08.wav_ASR	and they're coming out with a ladder apparently to help get the cat and the parrot out of the
wright204a_729.715_0.44.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_730.298_1.47.wav_ASR	oh that's that's a real picture
wright204a_733.872_5.81.wav_ASR	that's is a yeah that's is a yeah probably a fiddled screen
wright204a_740.511_1.38.wav_ASR	probably right here
wright204a_744.599_3.77.wav_ASR	the girl was apparently wasted down the river
wright204a_749.301_2.17.wav_ASR	and uh this is her researcher
wright204a_752.238_8.31.wav_ASR	and uh she is handing on to a brand that they're trying to get him get her to uh safe
wright204a_764.718_0.38.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_772.353_0.32.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_776.476_0.63.wav_ASR	yes i do
wright204a_903.564_5.15.wav_ASR	oh um she was
wright204a_911.851_7.38.wav_ASR	the the the storage is around the two dollars and the what i call the the cruel
wright204a_920.645_13.21.wav_ASR	and uh oh she was i i couldn't remember even from looking at that uh what the re reaction was to the the good girl uh sender
wright204a_935.994_4.63.wav_ASR	uh i know that she was like a silver
wright204a_941.361_9.2.wav_ASR	and had all to uh to uh
wright204a_950.842_7.62.wav_ASR	uh she was always doing stuff where the other two girls were you know very nice
wright204a_958.521_3.91.wav_ASR	it was all nice and stuff for
wright204a_962.813_18.18.wav_ASR	oh uh oh when they went to the the ball oh it turned out that the yeah so they put the shoe on
wright204a_982.77_14.44.wav_ASR	he uh then when it got away because it was a a a spongy that was gonna turn into a pomegranate uh she had to get back
wright204a_997.767_7.21.wav_ASR	and uh oh she uh she lost her shell
wright204a_1006.404_0.31.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_1007.312_9.14.wav_ASR	and so then when the people i guess one of the people
wright204a_1018.414_1.11.wav_ASR	well well
wright204a_1019.765_5.209.wav_ASR	it's it's
wright204a_1026.704_2.301.wav_ASR	so this is my trouble with this story
wright204a_1029.076_5.01.wav_ASR	oh we're trying to get oh the yeah
wright204a_1037.097_1.48.wav_ASR	it's the print
wright204a_1039.786_3.76.wav_ASR	and he he had he was trying to find
wright204a_1044.411_1.69.wav_ASR	and uh he was out of look
wright204a_1047.777_0.92.wav_ASR	you had a few
wright204a_1049.77_4.47.wav_ASR	and it just show the only one that really fit
wright204a_1055.312_1.88.wav_ASR	oh so
wright204a_1057.679_2.63.wav_ASR	and it will be man and wife
wright204a_1060.912_1.76.wav_ASR	you'll everything will be fine forever
