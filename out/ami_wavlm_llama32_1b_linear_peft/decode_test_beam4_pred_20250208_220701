adler06a_38.861_6.31.wav_ASR	got myself wrote with a people in and they sh for me
adler06a_56.436_1.61.wav_ASR	it could generally good
adler06a_58.769_2.39.wav_ASR	but working at this
adler06a_61.453_3.63.wav_ASR	the first w one my uh pig will forget it
adler06a_66.839_1.65.wav_ASR	because i had no
adler06a_70.256_2.92.wav_ASR	my f one is s colour and stuff
adler06a_74.761_0.83.wav_ASR	it couldn't talk
adler06a_88.29_1.18.wav_ASR	channel walking
adler06a_90.417_4.62.wav_ASR	and i had bookmarked some and then and then and
adler06a_96.291_3.8.wav_ASR	and uh finally i got it for a quadruple
adler06a_100.179_1.21.wav_ASR	sh it's good
adler06a_103.351_2.79.wav_ASR	just walking again some times is bad
adler06a_107.158_5.41.wav_ASR	just w we'll talk

adler21a_2.664_0.39.wav_ASR	okay
adler21a_5.92_1.13.wav_ASR	it's c uh better
adler21a_7.281_1.99.wav_ASR	that's the but it's very better
adler21a_9.895_3.11.wav_ASR	it's proving a little bit of a little but it's proving
adler21a_17.166_5.3.wav_ASR	uh no i'm s i am hard uh survey
adler21a_22.971_3.14.wav_ASR	so two weeks i'm sleeping
adler21a_26.855_7.58.wav_ASR	but i'm working up so and that's how and that is
adler21a_37.055_1.47.wav_ASR	two weeks is sleeping
adler21a_39.087_2.25.wav_ASR	and then working up
adler21a_41.386_2.66.wav_ASR	so that's how uh stroke happened
adler21a_49.407_0.57.wav_ASR	it's okay
adler21a_50.624_2.79.wav_ASR	and i mean uh yeah
adler21a_54.355_8.74.wav_ASR	uh i is uh speaking is microphone volume microphone
adler21a_63.656_6.77.wav_ASR	and arm and leg is finished like before finish finished
adler21a_71.59_7.97.wav_ASR	um but i still no idea what happened
adler21a_81.323_2.5.wav_ASR	yeah until you know so
adler21a_85.616_4.21.wav_ASR	people uh people say
adler21a_89.941_1.64.wav_ASR	listen sorry stroke
adler21a_91.957_1.09.wav_ASR	oh so i get
adler21a_103.325_8.25.wav_ASR	uh i mean s arm legs all the time all the time all the time
adler21a_127.656_2.34.wav_ASR	but to find out how you're talking is sure sure
adler21a_141.626_0.63.wav_ASR	so
adler21a_144.829_2.04.wav_ASR	lots of fun
adler21a_148.224_20.88.wav_ASR	uh well it's funny for me and uh d oh it's funny for me and uh david's turn

adler21a_328.999_0.33.wav_ASR	yeah
adler21a_347.64_0.37.wav_ASR	uh-huh
adler21a_350.628_0.45.wav_ASR	yes
adler21a_360.421_2.76.wav_ASR	bob is kicking a soccer
adler21a_364.722_11.37.wav_ASR	and kicking the soccer and um and kicking a
adler21a_378.86_12.37.wav_ASR	the house is the half ball is is flip ball is crash the card
adler21a_393.477_13.67.wav_ASR	and inside the rubber is
adler21a_408.181_1.11.wav_ASR	let's go on
adler21a_409.5_5.72.wav_ASR	because soccer is crashing the lamp
adler21a_417.587_4.96.wav_ASR	and bob is looking outside
adler21a_423.3_6.05.wav_ASR	and see oh s something was wrong
adler21a_447.928_1.47.wav_ASR	the boy is
adler21a_450.316_0.58.wav_ASR	no thank you
adler21a_451.063_7.53.wav_ASR	um it's okay with the name it's naming uh is cloudy but that's all
adler21a_462.05_5.91.wav_ASR	and then body is walking and drop jump jump up
adler21a_468.284_6.38.wav_ASR	and then um naming hard
adler21a_475.458_4.66.wav_ASR	and the boy running inside and say
adler21a_481.423_2.29.wav_ASR	uh yeah sorry about that
adler21a_485.037_3.48.wav_ASR	uh um covered with rain
adler21a_489.528_10.08.wav_ASR	and the b name is it's a very long
adler21a_505.31_2.8.wav_ASR	it's it's uh mm-hmm
adler21a_509.085_7.43.wav_ASR	uh anyway and then he boy is walking to the bus
adler21a_517.602_8.881.wav_ASR	but also he is b in bullet
adler21a_610.002_1.08.wav_ASR	breaking break in
adler21a_613.058_4.32.wav_ASR	uh okay
adler21a_619.081_14.25.wav_ASR	and the p uh cat is
adler21a_641.052_6.7.wav_ASR	um but the down stars is curve is
adler21a_648.834_1.67.wav_ASR	come back come back come back
adler21a_652.325_10.37.wav_ASR	but uh he some uh he she is calling a fireman
adler21a_665.53_0.47.wav_ASR	and save
adler21a_666.404_7.72.wav_ASR	pleases help me because kitty cat is up stars
adler21a_675.509_11.34.wav_ASR	so he sh he two fireman is racing to go to
adler21a_689.86_27.83.wav_ASR	is it she is both of those letters
adler21a_720.587_0.72.wav_ASR	so i guess
adler21a_740.441_7.93.wav_ASR	the flashing the flashing is very rapid
adler21a_749.339_21.45.wav_ASR	and the g um the goal is to the touch um the and screen
adler21a_773.066_19.28.wav_ASR	and the one guy who's finance or something like that he was he is erasing now walking because very fiddling
adler21a_793.831_12.39.wav_ASR	um but he is covered by life jacket and stuff like that
adler21a_807.606_7.44.wav_ASR	um anyway sh he is going slow but steadily
adler21a_815.923_1.34.wav_ASR	and that's it
adler21a_827.231_0.36.wav_ASR	yes
adler21a_923.982_22.34.wav_ASR	be uh and two is uh and two is uh it's uh and two is uh it's uh it's uh it's uh it's uh it's uh it's uh it's uh it's uh it's uh it's
adler21a_948.4_10.96.wav_ASR	she three is fin uh ruud um simba and moran also
adler21a_960.279_10.66.wav_ASR	and m and two um are very um very cool
adler21a_972.523_2.36.wav_ASR	and the other one is t kind
adler21a_976.983_9.67.wav_ASR	uh and then later on like mar march early on like
adler21a_995.146_8.08.wav_ASR	and he he is very sweet but very um has to work
adler21a_1003.993_23.14.wav_ASR	and turn button to is very cool but it's very um cool
adler21a_1029.309_12.71.wav_ASR	uh and he she is looking at the colour and i dunno and looking
adler21a_1043.53_7.7.wav_ASR	um anyway so sh he uh let's open up
adler21a_1052.088_2.34.wav_ASR	and moran and two circles say
adler21a_1054.784_2.35.wav_ASR	my god it's a canal
adler21a_1057.772_1.87.wav_ASR	um and

Baycrest12308a_788.28_1.25.wav_ASR	the b
Baycrest12308a_789.761_0.42.wav_ASR	yeah
fridriksson07a_7.195_0.35.wav_ASR	okay
fridriksson07a_12.858_2.12.wav_ASR	and i th i think it's a lot better
fridriksson07a_16.931_3.91.wav_ASR	because i before i use to search for words
fridriksson07a_21.898_1.66.wav_ASR	lot of times i couldn't find um
fridriksson07a_23.926_4.6.wav_ASR	but now if i think a minute then i can get up a dozen
fridriksson07a_31.164_0.69.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
fridriksson07a_41.962_3.81.wav_ASR	oh the you know it it is it comes kind
fridriksson07a_46.406_2.5.wav_ASR	little bit i can remember a lot
fridriksson07a_49.365_4.87.wav_ASR	but we're on we were down on uh ju we lit in taxes at the time
fridriksson07a_54.53_1.15.wav_ASR	and we're in joystick
fridriksson07a_55.7_2.71.wav_ASR	and we had had been there for six weeks
fridriksson07a_58.659_4.07.wav_ASR	because my daughter was flying all over the country looking for a job
fridriksson07a_63.161_2.6.wav_ASR	so so we were on our way back
fridriksson07a_66.298_2.13.wav_ASR	and we stopped at a moat
fridriksson07a_69.425_1.08.wav_ASR	and i said to my husband
fridriksson07a_70.687_1.25.wav_ASR	oh feel very weak
fridriksson07a_71.96_0.39.wav_ASR	oh that's
fridriksson07a_72.494_1.99.wav_ASR	maybe i got a edit or something
fridriksson07a_74.55_5.75.wav_ASR	so then the later gave me the key to put in the door and i kept dropping it
fridriksson07a_80.536_3.17.wav_ASR	then didn't i go down and i couldn't pick it up
fridriksson07a_85.175_3.87.wav_ASR	and so she had to come up on my phone the camera and she picked it up for me
fridriksson07a_89.612_2.87.wav_ASR	then i went back to the door and i still couldn't do it
fridriksson07a_92.88_1.18.wav_ASR	yes this is your right hand
fridriksson07a_95.975_3.19.wav_ASR	and so then my husband says
fridriksson07a_100.237_4.02.wav_ASR	oh be over to check in because the name is having problems
fridriksson07a_104.458_2.84.wav_ASR	it i think she's the teletext so i think she
fridriksson07a_107.516_7.12.wav_ASR	so sh he gives me you know um pat which i never drink
fridriksson07a_115.89_1.79.wav_ASR	and then he you know so he said
fridriksson07a_117.874_0.86.wav_ASR	take your shelter
fridriksson07a_119.121_0.79.wav_ASR	so i told him
fridriksson07a_120.03_0.94.wav_ASR	uh looked in my purse
fridriksson07a_121.4_0.62.wav_ASR	oh hang on
fridriksson07a_122.301_0.79.wav_ASR	in your night
fridriksson07a_123.114_1.2.wav_ASR	and i couldn't find it
fridriksson07a_125.166_3.979.wav_ASR	and then he said for the first time i got really angry
fridriksson07a_129.196_2.33.wav_ASR	and i never f lose my template
fridriksson07a_132.305_0.33.wav_ASR	let's
fridriksson07a_132.756_1.36.wav_ASR	or just look at this
fridriksson07a_134.248_3.05.wav_ASR	nei for my person up for like this
fridriksson07a_137.428_1.36.wav_ASR	nee oh
fridriksson07a_139.055_1.79.wav_ASR	he said then he got scared
fridriksson07a_141.995_0.98.wav_ASR	let's draw a r
fridriksson07a_142.991_1.34.wav_ASR	so the latest s
fridriksson07a_144.644_1.55.wav_ASR	think she's having a stroke
fridriksson07a_147.515_0.959.wav_ASR	oh
fridriksson07a_148.682_5.37.wav_ASR	there's a hystal just about the n next street over
fridriksson07a_154.827_4.81.wav_ASR	so my husband got me in the banana and give me over there
fridriksson07a_159.721_4.47.wav_ASR	and then thank goodness we had an insert that figured it was a stroke
fridriksson07a_164.948_2.05.wav_ASR	he gave me the material
fridriksson07a_169.715_0.46.wav_ASR	oh no
fridriksson07a_170.861_9.05.wav_ASR	so um and then they they didn't have a place to do treats
fridriksson07a_181.19_1.6.wav_ASR	but that intern you want to do
fridriksson07a_182.837_4.29.wav_ASR	so they had to put me in another room
fridriksson07a_187.588_0.56.wav_ASR	you know
fridriksson07a_188.923_0.32.wav_ASR	yeah
fridriksson07a_190.497_1.22.wav_ASR	and so they keep say
fridriksson07a_191.901_0.71.wav_ASR	oh you okay
fridriksson07a_192.72_0.84.wav_ASR	are you okay
fridriksson07a_193.576_0.33.wav_ASR	in that
fridriksson07a_194.05_0.37.wav_ASR	it's true
fridriksson07a_194.439_6.32.wav_ASR	but then i began to go in and out because i don't know what they were given me you know
fridriksson07a_201.391_3.15.wav_ASR	and then the doctor came in and he asked me what's my name
fridriksson07a_205.994_0.96.wav_ASR	and i said
fridriksson07a_208.898_2.28.wav_ASR	that's trying to say it but i couldn't say it
fridriksson07a_212.171_1.48.wav_ASR	then then he says
fridriksson07a_214.35_0.88.wav_ASR	how all are you
fridriksson07a_216.399_0.57.wav_ASR	oh he said
fridriksson07a_217.111_0.9.wav_ASR	in your budget
fridriksson07a_219.005_1.11.wav_ASR	you don't need
fridriksson07a_220.45_0.84.wav_ASR	can't talk
fridriksson07a_222.063_0.94.wav_ASR	so i w
fridriksson07a_223.523_2.15.wav_ASR	one two three four five six seven
fridriksson07a_225.994_1.12.wav_ASR	but i didn't say it like that
fridriksson07a_227.24_4.21.wav_ASR	let's count it
fridriksson07a_232.323_2.83.wav_ASR	then i did eight
fridriksson07a_237.135_1.83.wav_ASR	and then i looked at him and i say
fridriksson07a_239.277_2.64.wav_ASR	you must have my data because
fridriksson07a_242.792_1.95.wav_ASR	oh have enough fingers for that
fridriksson07a_245.021_3.54.wav_ASR	oh
fridriksson07a_249.024_1.65.wav_ASR	he's he's
fridriksson07a_250.835_2.01.wav_ASR	you got a good sentence of human
fridriksson07a_256.82_0.3.wav_ASR	yeah
fridriksson07a_257.197_3.06.wav_ASR	and then later on they told me he says
fridriksson07a_261.769_4.051.wav_ASR	or r. r. s gonna sleep in the bed beside you tonight
fridriksson07a_266.85_4.52.wav_ASR	and we were in uh that time
fridriksson07a_272.602_3.81.wav_ASR	and and i looked and i didn't know who my husband was
fridriksson07a_278.266_2.54.wav_ASR	and i thought it was some strange man but
fridriksson07a_280.927_0.75.wav_ASR	oh it was thinking
fridriksson07a_282.262_4.19.wav_ASR	why are they putting a dog in my room with me you know
fridriksson07a_286.975_1.15.wav_ASR	so i so he said
fridriksson07a_288.267_0.67.wav_ASR	is that okay
fridriksson07a_288.958_0.49.wav_ASR	it is
fridriksson07a_289.53_0.61.wav_ASR	shoah
fridriksson07a_290.551_2.12.wav_ASR	yeah
fridriksson07a_292.915_0.91.wav_ASR	ah think
fridriksson07a_293.844_1.84.wav_ASR	yeah i just couldn't get any words out
fridriksson07a_296.74_3.11.wav_ASR	and then um then then he is
fridriksson07a_300.171_4.5.wav_ASR	but it in the middle of the night i walked up and and i m recognised him
fridriksson07a_305.064_0.46.wav_ASR	ah i see
fridriksson07a_306.357_2.93.wav_ASR	are you're starving and i need to go to the bathroom
fridriksson07a_310.253_0.99.wav_ASR	you get another chip
fridriksson07a_313.88_0.85.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
fridriksson07a_316.138_0.459.wav_ASR	yeah
fridriksson07a_320.571_5.5.wav_ASR	now that's the first one that they picked up with the extra
fridriksson07a_327.299_0.71.wav_ASR	with the big one
fridriksson07a_334.398_3.35.wav_ASR	yeah i knew it w i knew that that was my husband's name
fridriksson07a_339.397_0.45.wav_ASR	yeah i th
fridriksson07a_341.387_1.62.wav_ASR	stop scrolling
fridriksson07a_343.056_0.56.wav_ASR	and i say
fridriksson07a_345.03_1.51.wav_ASR	well i didn't say go to the battery
fridriksson07a_347.055_1.31.wav_ASR	beep
fridriksson07a_349.874_0.59.wav_ASR	yeah
fridriksson07a_354.28_3.94.wav_ASR	so they let him sleep in my room that i was there
fridriksson07a_360.712_4.76.wav_ASR	they were helpful you know because they said you know sometimes
fridriksson07a_365.98_3.24.wav_ASR	because i lost control of everything though really
fridriksson07a_369.808_0.89.wav_ASR	that's really bad
fridriksson07a_373.4_2.59.wav_ASR	well there i was there for a week
fridriksson07a_377.916_4.02.wav_ASR	and so they call the r. s
fridriksson07a_382.129_1.52.wav_ASR	we've gotta go home
fridriksson07a_383.794_0.35.wav_ASR	let's see
fridriksson07a_384.572_0.78.wav_ASR	our house is
fridriksson07a_385.43_2.51.wav_ASR	 nobody's there and this and that you know
fridriksson07a_388.494_2.53.wav_ASR	and we were taking care of our doctors' health
fridriksson07a_391.627_6.21.wav_ASR	because she was down jordan then 'cause she was working there just for one year yeah
fridriksson07a_398.159_3.0.wav_ASR	and she got her p. h. degrees so then she's travelling
fridriksson07a_401.878_2.74.wav_ASR	and so he said
fridriksson07a_404.804_1.78.wav_ASR	you're i'm not gonna take
fridriksson07a_406.77_3.19.wav_ASR	uh they said so matrix say
fridriksson07a_410.531_2.16.wav_ASR	sh you have to go straight
fridriksson07a_413.363_3.3.wav_ASR	you cannot stop just to go to the watchroom and eat
fridriksson07a_417.146_3.1.wav_ASR	don't c take it s go to your house tonight
fridriksson07a_420.887_13.7.wav_ASR	and uh but in the meantime my son's laptop had flipped back and forth to uh textures to meet us when we got there
fridriksson07a_435.642_1.62.wav_ASR	he took me home and let me
fridriksson07a_438.04_2.71.wav_ASR	or my husband gave me a shell or a new t
fridriksson07a_440.771_2.14.wav_ASR	and then we went on to the other half
fridriksson07a_443.23_1.41.wav_ASR	but they were very good too
fridriksson07a_444.686_2.19.wav_ASR	uh i stayed at the university
fridriksson07a_447.397_6.8.wav_ASR	why it stayed at the a s uh straight clean for
fridriksson07a_456.3_2.82.wav_ASR	think i was in there about three weeks
fridriksson07a_462.218_4.06.wav_ASR	but they had their own section
fridriksson07a_467.107_4.77.wav_ASR	and then i got in the wheel chair and uh and i c
fridriksson07a_472.02_3.83.wav_ASR	don't want those plates that you you put your th legs in
fridriksson07a_476.555_1.66.wav_ASR	and i put my feet on the floor
fridriksson07a_478.5_1.15.wav_ASR	and that was it
fridriksson07a_488.923_2.87.wav_ASR	yeah i ran out of that little bit of in the wheel chair
fridriksson07a_491.814_4.36.wav_ASR	oh but they wouldn't let the off the floor but they was a big floor you know
fridriksson07a_497.438_3.59.wav_ASR	so i th but i was there for oh a long time
fridriksson07a_501.709_2.11.wav_ASR	but uh i think three or four weeks
fridriksson07a_503.871_1.97.wav_ASR	and then i was disappointed
fridriksson07a_505.858_4.21.wav_ASR	and then i had to come back for parameters three times a week
fridriksson07a_519.422_3.589.wav_ASR	well we did the physical therapy
fridriksson07a_523.03_9.341.wav_ASR	that was all included the physical the um to l to learn how to say the words and stuff
fridriksson07a_533.132_5.07.wav_ASR	and then slowly but surely i realised that i've lost a lot of things
fridriksson07a_539.154_3.42.wav_ASR	because apple i could add like crazy and i still can
fridriksson07a_543.361_1.97.wav_ASR	but to get it out i can't do it
fridriksson07a_546.994_0.36.wav_ASR	yeah
fridriksson07a_552.553_5.4.wav_ASR	then say it sometimes but when i write it down it's just jump up
fridriksson07a_559.385_8.25.wav_ASR	like if if i can add up to one thousand nine ninety nine ninety nine
fridriksson07a_573.324_1.49.wav_ASR	that was three years ago
fridriksson07a_575.777_2.22.wav_ASR	and the other one i n nothing about
fridriksson07a_578.016_3.11.wav_ASR	but they said there was a form of a small one
fridriksson07a_586.492_1.93.wav_ASR	yeah even though i hate that
fridriksson07a_597.83_0.48.wav_ASR	yeah
fridriksson07a_618.001_2.39.wav_ASR	well it i'll start out with my husband
fridriksson07a_620.41_5.5.wav_ASR	we uh in uh in n okay we've been married for forty nine years
fridriksson07a_627.119_2.11.wav_ASR	the two children a boy and a girl
fridriksson07a_629.949_4.49.wav_ASR	and my daughter lives here in my son's school
fridriksson07a_634.995_2.21.wav_ASR	and he and he has two sons
fridriksson07a_637.772_6.55.wav_ASR	and then my daughter here we w went to florid because she was working on her p. h. d. and
fridriksson07a_644.678_2.5.wav_ASR	now in flash uh in textures
fridriksson07a_647.575_1.38.wav_ASR	and we moved down there
fridriksson07a_649.271_5.85.wav_ASR	because uh then she got pregnant and her husband was working in d. c.
fridriksson07a_655.553_3.27.wav_ASR	so she we went down there to help c take care of the baby
fridriksson07a_660.026_1.75.wav_ASR	yeah that's a good s thing
fridriksson07a_661.89_1.92.wav_ASR	but he's only six years old now
fridriksson07a_664.689_1.74.wav_ASR	the cracker jack
fridriksson07a_670.593_1.86.wav_ASR	yeah
fridriksson07a_672.629_3.33.wav_ASR	there's three boys two and minus one here
fridriksson07a_711.443_2.53.wav_ASR	my grandson he's a good soccer player
fridriksson07a_714.493_0.3.wav_ASR	yeah
fridriksson07a_717.518_0.61.wav_ASR	that's okay
fridriksson07a_718.66_2.54.wav_ASR	but this is uh he's kickin that
fridriksson07a_721.32_1.16.wav_ASR	he's playing in
fridriksson07a_722.5_1.79.wav_ASR	and it's cick in the ball
fridriksson07a_725.909_3.58.wav_ASR	the ball is going to the man's room window
fridriksson07a_731.579_1.5.wav_ASR	oh oh bill in there
fridriksson07a_734.29_2.09.wav_ASR	oh this
fridriksson07a_741.969_2.72.wav_ASR	this is when the balls is coming through his window
fridriksson07a_744.804_1.02.wav_ASR	the windows broken
fridriksson07a_747.278_3.42.wav_ASR	and this he's looking out probably to see who did it
fridriksson07a_752.449_1.52.wav_ASR	so i'd be looking for
fridriksson07a_785.694_3.29.wav_ASR	well i think
fridriksson07a_790.253_2.85.wav_ASR	so uh this is not really number one right
fridriksson07a_796.242_0.63.wav_ASR	oh yeah
fridriksson07a_798.556_0.579.wav_ASR	yeah
fridriksson07a_799.992_4.2.wav_ASR	yes it's he's p going after to school 'cause he's got a bad back
fridriksson07a_805.885_1.0.wav_ASR	and it's raining
fridriksson07a_807.01_3.14.wav_ASR	why is it in first
fridriksson07a_810.817_0.66.wav_ASR	yes right
fridriksson07a_811.5_1.6.wav_ASR	he's got his animal right
fridriksson07a_815.878_0.51.wav_ASR	oh
fridriksson07a_817.162_0.42.wav_ASR	oh
fridriksson07a_821.77_2.95.wav_ASR	yes an amber uh on here
fridriksson07a_825.093_5.53.wav_ASR	and the he must be been out side in for an umbrella right
fridriksson07a_832.955_1.49.wav_ASR	so not in order
fridriksson07a_840.232_2.07.wav_ASR	okay there he's getting ready to leave
fridriksson07a_842.321_2.02.wav_ASR	but his mother's giving him an umbrella
fridriksson07a_846.794_3.74.wav_ASR	that's this this why is
fridriksson07a_852.162_0.48.wav_ASR	okay
fridriksson07a_854.431_2.41.wav_ASR	she's still giving him the amber right
fridriksson07a_857.405_1.36.wav_ASR	well these two go together
fridriksson07a_866.611_0.63.wav_ASR	he's really
fridriksson07a_868.979_2.65.wav_ASR	okay then he walks out side and this rating
fridriksson07a_871.65_3.54.wav_ASR	he d he doesn't have the umbrella or he would put it up right
fridriksson07a_876.373_1.0.wav_ASR	he comes back in
fridriksson07a_877.593_0.6.wav_ASR	oh yeah
fridriksson07a_878.21_2.01.wav_ASR	but now he has this amber uh
fridriksson07a_881.005_1.305.wav_ASR	so ready to go to school
fridriksson07a_882.387_2.95.wav_ASR	why did he put his number up and number three
fridriksson07a_888.499_0.65.wav_ASR	okay
fridriksson07a_902.448_0.37.wav_ASR	okay
fridriksson07a_903.463_3.92.wav_ASR	this one the cat is up a tree
fridriksson07a_908.344_2.97.wav_ASR	and the looks like the farthest point after it
fridriksson07a_913.497_3.77.wav_ASR	and the little girl standing there ready to catch him i guess
fridriksson07a_917.394_1.71.wav_ASR	she was writing her bye
fridriksson07a_921.067_0.67.wav_ASR	yeah it's a bit
fridriksson07a_922.129_1.97.wav_ASR	oh here's a dog staring up at the tree
fridriksson07a_924.145_1.83.wav_ASR	and they call the fire department
fridriksson07a_928.923_1.59.wav_ASR	so they'll get the cat out right
fridriksson07a_932.955_6.92.wav_ASR	it couldn't understand what the ladder is for but i guess the guy climbed up the ladder and then the ladder failed
fridriksson07a_954.76_0.34.wav_ASR	yeah
fridriksson07a_958.107_4.76.wav_ASR	oh i think the last time i read it was
fridriksson07a_975.646_0.54.wav_ASR	oh okay
fridriksson07a_1095.08_12.54.wav_ASR	well the the the thing of it is that that that sender uh was she was under the control of her steph's sister
fridriksson07a_1108.411_2.15.wav_ASR	and they would delete her like a mail
fridriksson07a_1111.509_4.88.wav_ASR	and then um they were having a ball at the
fridriksson07a_1117.065_3.86.wav_ASR	that's what she was looking at the window and everything
fridriksson07a_1121.443_6.61.wav_ASR	and then when they decided they wouldn't let her go because she would be in competition with the two sisters
fridriksson07a_1129.018_3.57.wav_ASR	and then a fi a fire battery came
fridriksson07a_1133.326_5.58.wav_ASR	and got her all dressed and everything and ready to go to the ball
fridriksson07a_1139.72_2.4.wav_ASR	and a pear of uh supplements
fridriksson07a_1143.746_8.07.wav_ASR	and uh she went to the ball but she had to be back by twelve and a half
fridriksson07a_1153.31_1.67.wav_ASR	and so she was dancing
fridriksson07a_1155.0_4.63.wav_ASR	the the print's chose her to dance with
fridriksson07a_1159.677_2.02.wav_ASR	and i guess he filled in a lot right away
fridriksson07a_1162.249_4.76.wav_ASR	and then the t cl well twelve
fridriksson07a_1167.86_3.01.wav_ASR	and she ran out but she lost the scribble
fridriksson07a_1172.448_1.9.wav_ASR	and then they found the clipper
fridriksson07a_1174.419_9.12.wav_ASR	and then sh by the time she got back her her her chair had turned to a bump in
fridriksson07a_1184.579_1.19.wav_ASR	oh it's a rectangle
fridriksson07a_1185.919_1.97.wav_ASR	okay now let me think a minute
fridriksson07a_1188.29_6.09.wav_ASR	um and so they were going all over looking for the person that lost the slipper
fridriksson07a_1194.4_3.25.wav_ASR	and they came back to cinderella's house
fridriksson07a_1198.045_4.27.wav_ASR	so they s tried it with the two sets systems and it didn't fit
fridriksson07a_1203.12_4.56.wav_ASR	so then they ask scenario to try it
fridriksson07a_1207.7_1.21.wav_ASR	and they were just
fridriksson07a_1209.733_1.54.wav_ASR	oh no she wasn't even there
fridriksson07a_1211.295_5.34.wav_ASR	but when they turn it on then fit
fridriksson07a_1217.703_5.54.wav_ASR	so they took it back to the the cat's
fridriksson07a_1224.46_4.25.wav_ASR	and the she managed the price
fridriksson07a_1231.895_1.51.wav_ASR	oh
fridriksson07a_1233.591_1.89.wav_ASR	actually you left happily after
fridriksson07a_1235.5_2.72.wav_ASR	but that's it oh stories like that
fridriksson07a_1250.689_2.41.wav_ASR	oh well first you get the pendent battery out
fridriksson07a_1253.322_1.07.wav_ASR	let's get your brain
fridriksson07a_1255.267_3.84.wav_ASR	you purti put the penguin on one side
fridriksson07a_1259.325_3.76.wav_ASR	and then the other side you put the yellow
fridriksson07a_1263.241_1.1.wav_ASR	oh
fridriksson07a_1264.393_1.48.wav_ASR	and you
fridriksson07a_1266.034_0.62.wav_ASR	let's see
fridriksson07a_1269.257_2.28.wav_ASR	it's a lot of those for example
kansas01a_41.424_0.86.wav_ASR	oh no
kansas01a_66.697_0.76.wav_ASR	yeah
kansas01a_75.763_0.31.wav_ASR	yes
kansas01a_89.708_0.5.wav_ASR	yeah
kansas01a_119.869_1.81.wav_ASR	yes
kansas01a_134.307_4.35.wav_ASR	um i'm um i'm w working uh
kansas01a_150.198_1.05.wav_ASR	oh
kansas01a_168.644_1.06.wav_ASR	well i don't know
kansas01a_173.633_1.43.wav_ASR	uh i didn't have to do it
kansas01a_176.54_1.69.wav_ASR	and i didn't have to do a
kansas01a_179.41_0.96.wav_ASR	oh
kansas01a_235.029_4.67.wav_ASR	oh i didn't have to do it
kansas01a_240.548_3.78.wav_ASR	then i didn't have to do it or walking
kansas01a_256.37_0.73.wav_ASR	you have to destroy it
kansas01a_313.02_1.47.wav_ASR	the walk of walking
kansas01a_320.997_1.48.wav_ASR	oh
kansas01a_340.682_0.97.wav_ASR	oh yeah
kansas01a_343.944_1.51.wav_ASR	it's too woah
kansas01a_357.862_0.64.wav_ASR	uh-huh
kansas01a_409.874_1.3.wav_ASR	oh
kansas01a_420.149_1.03.wav_ASR	um
kansas01a_423.817_0.37.wav_ASR	yeah
kansas01a_437.705_0.34.wav_ASR	okay
kansas01a_440.452_0.48.wav_ASR	yeah
kansas01a_443.318_5.75.wav_ASR	oh the whole of the world in
kansas01a_453.026_0.47.wav_ASR	uh-huh

kansas01a_526.599_0.44.wav_ASR	yeah
kansas01a_534.918_0.3.wav_ASR	yeah
kansas01a_550.311_0.95.wav_ASR	yeah
kansas01a_576.241_0.43.wav_ASR	so me
kansas01a_586.675_3.51.wav_ASR	oh yeah
kansas01a_593.328_0.49.wav_ASR	yeah
kansas01a_607.939_1.54.wav_ASR	yeah
kansas01a_612.96_0.54.wav_ASR	or
kansas01a_628.319_1.87.wav_ASR	yeah but uh
kansas01a_656.504_0.3.wav_ASR	yeah
kansas01a_785.54_3.22.wav_ASR	it's the the work of w working
kansas01a_796.427_0.34.wav_ASR	yeah
kansas01a_799.188_2.5.wav_ASR	the uh the wallpaper
kansas01a_802.938_5.45.wav_ASR	um you don't have to do it
kansas01a_816.473_0.49.wav_ASR	yeah
kansas01a_858.727_2.98.wav_ASR	you can uh
kansas01a_861.862_9.15.wav_ASR	do you want a bookmark in your document uh do you like
kansas01a_872.298_0.39.wav_ASR	yeah
kansas04a_19.317_0.78.wav_ASR	apparently good
kansas04a_27.196_0.52.wav_ASR	yes
kansas04a_29.341_0.86.wav_ASR	please tell me about it
kansas04a_30.225_7.48.wav_ASR	it's uh Fabulous twenty eight in ninety eight
kansas04a_42.61_11.38.wav_ASR	well my stroke started on uh one night and uh i did not think it was too bad
kansas04a_54.764_1.58.wav_ASR	oh sorry no not actually
kansas04a_56.809_9.79.wav_ASR	and then i went out with my friends and uh they were concerned because i was drawing artistic
kansas04a_68.079_9.21.wav_ASR	uh she said that uh i drew too close to cars and i had difficulty with my speech
kansas04a_77.957_5.16.wav_ASR	and i went home and i met my husband that the local worri
kansas04a_84.83_3.35.wav_ASR	and uh uh had a drink and i went home
kansas04a_88.529_5.344.wav_ASR	oh that was not my usual uh way of doing
kansas04a_95.153_1.87.wav_ASR	don't talking to anybody or anything
kansas04a_97.072_3.29.wav_ASR	and uh so i went home and i went to bed that night
kansas04a_100.589_2.91.wav_ASR	and i got up the next morning and went to work
kansas04a_104.276_4.63.wav_ASR	um i'm going to a uh our chamber meeting
kansas04a_109.508_10.63.wav_ASR	and uh i packed and went in and when i came back out i noticed that i packed very badly
kansas04a_121.372_4.48.wav_ASR	and i went to work and then uh one of the girls came in and said
kansas04a_126.873_2.64.wav_ASR	you're not using your arm correctly
kansas04a_131.007_0.4.wav_ASR	yeah
kansas04a_131.688_1.2.wav_ASR	think i'm having a stroke
kansas04a_133.315_0.93.wav_ASR	call the doctor
kansas04a_134.744_8.79.wav_ASR	and he told me uh she told me to go to the memory room and uh not to destroy
kansas04a_144.096_13.82.wav_ASR	and at that point i was confused enough that i was thinking about the uh amplitude across the street at home and not a one across the street from my office
kansas04a_158.827_1.8.wav_ASR	so i think i'd i'd write myself
kansas04a_161.92_1.11.wav_ASR	so i drew myself
kansas04a_163.284_3.31.wav_ASR	ah i got out there in the pocket in the pocket plate
kansas04a_167.312_3.2.wav_ASR	and went in and and then i met my husband there
kansas04a_170.986_6.08.wav_ASR	and uh i told him to tell them wha what i thought
kansas04a_177.562_3.58.wav_ASR	because i could not communicate with that point
kansas04a_182.356_4.06.wav_ASR	and i was there for over night and they sent me home
kansas04a_187.406_9.41.wav_ASR	and then i did not feel well the next morning so i he i had him take me back to the household and i stayed for couple weeks
kansas04a_207.011_5.1.wav_ASR	well i had television in my on my speech and uh writing
kansas04a_213.604_6.17.wav_ASR	um but they didn't give it to me for very long
kansas04a_220.931_5.04.wav_ASR	mean uh i was just when i was in the hotel i had my speech and a reading therapy
kansas04a_226.382_3.15.wav_ASR	and then i got home and had some physical therapy
kansas04a_259.052_0.729.wav_ASR	excuse me
kansas04a_263.423_8.6.wav_ASR	well when i got married the first time i had to uh plan my whole editing myself because mom was much older
kansas04a_273.102_2.34.wav_ASR	and she left it up to me
kansas04a_276.529_5.33.wav_ASR	and uh i went home and then went back to lord
kansas04a_281.881_3.75.wav_ASR	how i got married in london uh in dante's chapter
kansas04a_294.955_9.48.wav_ASR	and we had dinosaur and uh then we went to back to the hotel
kansas04a_304.94_3.42.wav_ASR	and uh my opinion already made me
kansas04a_309.335_2.86.wav_ASR	he is a master of methodist manager
kansas04a_313.018_7.98.wav_ASR	and his wife took over the background
kansas04a_322.108_15.2.wav_ASR	and uh so then we went to the chapel and uh on the way uh my brother in law is driving and he always records
kansas04a_342.23_1.91.wav_ASR	uh i think that will be enough if that's all
kansas04a_369.621_4.36.wav_ASR	well this little boy is practicing his soccer ball
kansas04a_376.048_2.66.wav_ASR	and then he kicks it through the window
kansas04a_379.812_1.49.wav_ASR	and it breaks the window
kansas04a_382.375_3.03.wav_ASR	and it goes into this man's house
kansas04a_386.256_1.9.wav_ASR	and he's very standard
kansas04a_389.349_6.47.wav_ASR	and uh he gets up and looks out the window to see where it came from
kansas04a_396.096_10.7.wav_ASR	now it does not tell you whether the boy ran away or whether he came and confess that he had a kick the soccer ball
kansas04a_435.24_4.79.wav_ASR	but there wants the s little boy to take the amber
kansas04a_443.068_1.73.wav_ASR	it doesn't want to take the amber
kansas04a_446.585_4.68.wav_ASR	so it goes out and its starts to range according as his mother told him it would
kansas04a_452.243_1.56.wav_ASR	so he goes back
kansas04a_454.24_0.91.wav_ASR	should tell it
kansas04a_455.171_1.15.wav_ASR	and it's very wet
kansas04a_457.426_5.56.wav_ASR	so we goes back in the house and she's very angry with them because he hasn't taken the email
kansas04a_463.777_7.44.wav_ASR	so in the last picture he has the amber and it's up and he's walking very happily
kansas04a_506.81_1.84.wav_ASR	well the cat is in the tree
kansas04a_510.155_1.81.wav_ASR	dog is boring it's cat
kansas04a_513.126_4.38.wav_ASR	and the little girl is crying because her cat is in the tree
kansas04a_519.099_8.07.wav_ASR	and his father tried to get it with a ladder and the ladder has fallen down
kansas04a_527.276_4.41.wav_ASR	and the father is still in the third he's looking very gloomy
kansas04a_532.649_2.56.wav_ASR	and the birds are saying
kansas04a_537.485_4.46.wav_ASR	that's rather queer is everything else is going on
kansas04a_542.482_5.22.wav_ASR	and the filename have been called and they are going to have to get the cat down
kansas04a_547.988_3.8.wav_ASR	but i think before they do they'll have to get dead anyway
kansas04a_576.487_1.57.wav_ASR	there is been a flood
kansas04a_582.466_4.23.wav_ASR	and this layout has been swapped away in the flag
kansas04a_590.504_12.69.wav_ASR	and this gentleman in the jacket is coming to reject her
kansas04a_604.912_6.77.wav_ASR	is then swept away in the flood also it looks too me
kansas04a_613.723_13.02.wav_ASR	and i do not quite understand this part
kansas04a_634.622_1.22.wav_ASR	yeah i think i am
kansas04a_636.851_1.21.wav_ASR	oh what is that
kansas04a_643.48_6.31.wav_ASR	yeah it but which one is being rejected in which one isn't
kansas04a_661.844_0.6.wav_ASR	oh yes
kansas04a_668.087_0.84.wav_ASR	now theoretically
kansas04a_688.588_0.82.wav_ASR	okay
kansas04a_756.402_5.91.wav_ASR	the story is about a cylinder and a wooden stepmother and our two half sisters
kansas04a_762.492_0.68.wav_ASR	and yeah yeah
kansas04a_763.997_11.67.wav_ASR	uh his step sisters were very uncommon to her and her m step daughter was two
kansas04a_776.051_5.38.wav_ASR	send real is left to sweep and clean and do whatever they wanted done
kansas04a_782.592_7.02.wav_ASR	so they got a letter inviting the household to the ball
kansas04a_791.424_5.37.wav_ASR	the m mather said that c. r. l. could not go
kansas04a_798.1_1.62.wav_ASR	and she was very upset
kansas04a_800.608_12.89.wav_ASR	and uh so she tried to uh get her dress together and the uh two stepsisters' store it apart
kansas04a_815.132_22.74.wav_ASR	and so um that they had out and told her uh that they had to get to go
kansas04a_837.925_6.54.wav_ASR	and and she was crying and and the very god mother said uh yes she could
kansas04a_845.377_4.79.wav_ASR	yeah or red and uh in with his hand of course
kansas04a_850.747_14.83.wav_ASR	uh and uh so the step mother and step children started out and she did not go with them
kansas04a_865.963_15.24.wav_ASR	uh but she went in the chair that the favourite godmother had connected out of a pump and uh uh morse and uh morse and uh stuff
kansas04a_881.57_0.95.wav_ASR	oh the hours is it
kansas04a_883.45_2.91.wav_ASR	uh and uh she went to the ball
kansas04a_887.004_4.42.wav_ASR	and the print read it over the ball
kansas04a_892.03_1.55.wav_ASR	and uh they dance
kansas04a_893.647_1.85.wav_ASR	and then it was a l twelve and a half
kansas04a_895.645_2.1.wav_ASR	he had to be home by twelve and a half
kansas04a_897.799_2.56.wav_ASR	so she ran out and lost her slipper
kansas04a_901.571_7.85.wav_ASR	and uh she went and got the paper and of course the chair all collapsed
kansas04a_909.825_1.47.wav_ASR	and she went home
kansas04a_912.607_9.82.wav_ASR	and uh then the following week or so time allows
kansas04a_922.783_10.71.wav_ASR	uh the uh fruit man is set out with a uh the slider to find w which colour in the in the kingdom he ped
kansas04a_934.46_7.29.wav_ASR	and uh she was locked in his room so she could not get to the come down
kansas04a_942.65_2.64.wav_ASR	and she was very up set
kansas04a_946.239_4.44.wav_ASR	and uh
kansas04a_952.096_3.38.wav_ASR	 anyway the the mouse rubber out
kansas04a_957.72_3.9.wav_ASR	and she came down and uh of course she fit the slider
kansas04a_962.075_1.87.wav_ASR	but the other did not
kansas04a_972.186_1.4.wav_ASR	yes
kansas04a_981.336_5.42.wav_ASR	and i would get two pieces of red the pen butter and the yellow
kansas04a_988.038_1.31.wav_ASR	then i would get a night
kansas04a_990.452_4.73.wav_ASR	and get it get some of the p. n. battery and spread it on one piece of red
kansas04a_995.9_4.73.wav_ASR	let's spread the yellow on the same piece of bread
kansas04a_1001.062_1.38.wav_ASR	and then put the top on it
kansas04a_1005.16_3.55.wav_ASR	oh yes
kansas05a_1.945_0.43.wav_ASR	uh-huh
kansas05a_16.495_9.12.wav_ASR	oh because there is a difference in the production
kansas05a_27.668_2.99.wav_ASR	uh uh i i'm okay
kansas05a_36.768_1.91.wav_ASR	oh yeah
kansas05a_42.431_11.8.wav_ASR	um uh over that time it's uh it's uh it's different
kansas05a_57.983_25.89.wav_ASR	um my first
kansas05a_87.858_2.74.wav_ASR	my hand my favourite
kansas05a_92.606_2.92.wav_ASR	just there's nothing left
kansas05a_96.506_1.63.wav_ASR	but i am i'm i'm dead
kansas05a_98.541_1.25.wav_ASR	then one can see it
kansas05a_99.838_0.82.wav_ASR	could't see me
kansas05a_101.586_9.15.wav_ASR	for a three bit three and a two uh twelve
kansas05a_112.575_1.06.wav_ASR	oh
kansas05a_115.048_2.8.wav_ASR	uh it's some parts that says that and sometimes i can
kansas05a_118.36_5.37.wav_ASR	oh let's see what
kansas05a_125.443_1.09.wav_ASR	there's nothing left
kansas05a_127.993_1.909.wav_ASR	uh i'm just i'm dead
kansas05a_131.245_7.83.wav_ASR	uh and i was out for a three t. days
kansas05a_139.126_0.93.wav_ASR	oh it's more than that
kansas05a_140.228_2.06.wav_ASR	it's it's the next
kansas05a_144.241_0.98.wav_ASR	that's it
kansas05a_146.12_1.43.wav_ASR	and there was nothing to me
kansas05a_147.686_1.37.wav_ASR	and i was i was dead
kansas05a_151.83_0.76.wav_ASR	and i don't even know
kansas05a_153.17_0.56.wav_ASR	ah that's it
kansas05a_153.876_1.23.wav_ASR	and i don't know what happened to
kansas05a_155.126_1.4.wav_ASR	yeah it was absolute
kansas05a_156.545_4.25.wav_ASR	and to this day i still have anything b bad for me
kansas05a_161.718_5.28.wav_ASR	and then times you know then over the time little bit and so on
kansas05a_167.398_2.5.wav_ASR	and uh it
kansas05a_171.793_2.08.wav_ASR	ah would i i didn't
kansas05a_175.435_1.32.wav_ASR	oh
kansas05a_184.646_2.04.wav_ASR	yeah there was nothing at that time
kansas05a_186.793_1.96.wav_ASR	there's nothing left for me
kansas05a_189.155_1.46.wav_ASR	it's over time yeah
kansas05a_192.239_0.952.wav_ASR	everything is
kansas05a_201.766_1.91.wav_ASR	oh that should
kansas05a_204.533_2.66.wav_ASR	um alright what did you want me to do
kansas05a_207.24_0.53.wav_ASR	okay me again
kansas05a_213.723_5.06.wav_ASR	oh oh that's all what i'm doing all this time
kansas05a_219.111_2.39.wav_ASR	oh putting together people uh you know
kansas05a_221.765_2.76.wav_ASR	working with my my family
kansas05a_225.46_2.16.wav_ASR	uh all of my friends a lot of people
kansas05a_228.695_4.27.wav_ASR	uh making uh changing my life that's not trying to do
kansas05a_240.771_2.37.wav_ASR	oh that's that's a long story
kansas05a_248.011_12.95.wav_ASR	um we just every m i'm making different a r oh or m moving around all the time
kansas05a_261.75_1.8.wav_ASR	but the people who have lived with me
kansas05a_265.238_4.71.wav_ASR	uh and oh what my family
kansas05a_271.278_1.91.wav_ASR	it's amazing what people have had to do
kansas05a_314.406_2.47.wav_ASR	there's a lot of there's uh the to talk about
kansas05a_317.968_1.25.wav_ASR	oh
kansas05a_336.496_20.16.wav_ASR	um i guess i could talk about we're doing right now we're all working together
kansas05a_358.095_5.66.wav_ASR	um and and i'm trying to do that well you know as soon as i could
kansas05a_363.8_0.7.wav_ASR	you know
kansas05a_364.761_2.21.wav_ASR	it didn't mean that but oh
kansas05a_374.375_2.99.wav_ASR	because i want to have that to do better
kansas05a_379.021_4.21.wav_ASR	uh it it's much more difficult
kansas05a_384.531_4.34.wav_ASR	you know when i look around and i see a lot of people who know
kansas05a_389.118_1.34.wav_ASR	you know they go around here
kansas05a_390.473_0.99.wav_ASR	you don't talk to people
kansas05a_391.485_2.95.wav_ASR	um uh a be able to differentiate
kansas05a_394.676_3.96.wav_ASR	you know i have no problems with my ageing you know and all that
kansas05a_398.681_2.2.wav_ASR	don't have any problems
kansas05a_401.308_2.97.wav_ASR	it used to have time as time gone on i had to get better
kansas05a_405.255_6.03.wav_ASR	um but um oh where is that going
kansas05a_411.561_1.63.wav_ASR	what are we asking me again
kansas05a_420.085_1.64.wav_ASR	oh yes
kansas05a_422.593_9.96.wav_ASR	um we're i'm working along with working towards having more time
kansas05a_434.918_3.07.wav_ASR	as time goes on i learned more and more what to do
kansas05a_439.556_1.65.wav_ASR	uh and so that's what i'm doing
kansas05a_467.065_0.97.wav_ASR	so they come different
kansas05a_468.95_4.67.wav_ASR	to tell me the story with a beginning a middle and an end
kansas05a_473.861_0.95.wav_ASR	of each one
kansas05a_480.821_2.29.wav_ASR	so each one of these i'm supposed to do something with it
kansas05a_483.43_0.79.wav_ASR	is that which you say in
kansas05a_497.343_0.77.wav_ASR	oh
kansas05a_504.475_17.939.wav_ASR	um well the first the first one this this m this m this m this m this mm
kansas05a_529.355_7.84.wav_ASR	it's a it's a p line a pen a pen oh a problem
kansas05a_540.213_11.2.wav_ASR	um that would with a uh that's a d a list a plan or
kansas05a_554.453_7.16.wav_ASR	there's a a friend editi working with that this one
kansas05a_563.678_3.27.wav_ASR	because the these people are making a problem
kansas05a_580.09_0.63.wav_ASR	what is that
kansas05a_589.826_1.82.wav_ASR	oh that's kinda dumb start
kansas05a_593.266_2.41.wav_ASR	and i think that takes a little work to make that look right
kansas05a_596.395_2.36.wav_ASR	um okay i'm supposed to
kansas05a_600.809_1.48.wav_ASR	what am i supposed to do with this one
kansas05a_603.491_0.94.wav_ASR	what's it a fruit of
kansas05a_605.0_1.13.wav_ASR	did the window break
kansas05a_608.523_1.45.wav_ASR	okay well that's it then
kansas05a_643.723_19.47.wav_ASR	so the the the first person is a n uh n a n a r um a problem there
kansas05a_666.113_5.28.wav_ASR	oh
kansas05a_674.141_4.53.wav_ASR	oh looking at the t. r. trends
kansas05a_681.195_14.69.wav_ASR	um and believing that the second people should um
kansas05a_702.031_0.71.wav_ASR	that think so
kansas05a_703.736_3.14.wav_ASR	he he's not supposed to do that for him
kansas05a_708.008_3.8.wav_ASR	this one guy wants the uh these pins to come down
kansas05a_712.325_1.15.wav_ASR	or you want them to buy himself
kansas05a_715.293_1.03.wav_ASR	let's not
kansas05a_718.205_0.34.wav_ASR	what
kansas05a_719.0_0.38.wav_ASR	which one
kansas05a_721.863_10.62.wav_ASR	uh there he's looking out on the uh the the the n the the the the chairs and how to deal with those things
kansas05a_732.528_5.87.wav_ASR	uh in the c the old stuff that that's being erased there
kansas05a_740.616_16.13.wav_ASR	uh th they're the the the the the the the the the little problems that they look here together
kansas05a_759.633_4.72.wav_ASR	oh the screen and the screen
kansas05a_764.921_0.88.wav_ASR	exa oh i see
kansas05a_766.03_12.56.wav_ASR	his mother wanted him to go back to the good stuff he was done before so that he can go back
kansas05a_779.24_4.95.wav_ASR	and it goes back and the ideas that he's got and make them go back and look look better
kansas05a_812.463_2.81.wav_ASR	well i guess you'd start with that
kansas05a_819.976_6.9.wav_ASR	the people setting with their they're mar they're stat they're stuff around
kansas05a_827.928_1.1.wav_ASR	and he to his
kansas05a_831.043_4.35.wav_ASR	according the m the kind of a s battery is people there
kansas05a_837.143_11.29.wav_ASR	uh let's see there's the the man who's trying to talk with him about that back over to that kind of stuff
kansas05a_848.486_4.42.wav_ASR	it was going to be overly carried by this younger stuff
kansas05a_854.133_3.71.wav_ASR	this can't make it is big enough to make that kind of stuff
kansas05a_859.378_4.24.wav_ASR	uh then there would be this thing it doesn't really
kansas05a_864.8_5.88.wav_ASR	uh this isn't necessarily what's going on here but it's there
kansas05a_872.161_11.16.wav_ASR	uh here's the the mer mer uh the people the m the leave left
kansas05a_888.045_3.84.wav_ASR	the person that's putting this stuff together
kansas05a_893.315_5.28.wav_ASR	uh f he's got he's got a person ready to help him with that
kansas05a_899.503_11.32.wav_ASR	here's uh information to him from the the people down s in stars trying to put this together with a new set
kansas05a_911.256_10.74.wav_ASR	here's the new um the young uh person who's trying to put that money back here so it goes everywhere in all of these things
kansas05a_922.725_3.13.wav_ASR	and then there is a natural
kansas05a_925.875_17.6.wav_ASR	then at the end of all of that stuff our stories from uh people in uh these kinds of of things putting together for the guy who's putting it at all together and uh the home drawing stuff
kansas05a_967.973_0.77.wav_ASR	let me see
kansas05a_972.913_22.41.wav_ASR	they got uh they got uh their both uh ideas from two uh ideas from two things right uh now
kansas05a_997.033_19.13.wav_ASR	uh the other one is the no the new uh um is the the young the person who's putting together that that old stuff uh that he's trying to help him for himself
kansas05a_1017.493_7.68.wav_ASR	then there's a uh then his m that's a mi a young um a man
kansas05a_1025.219_1.919.wav_ASR	oh this is a one but he's doing that
kansas05a_1027.931_5.52.wav_ASR	then a one a man is putting this stuff uh for him
kansas05a_1033.56_13.711.wav_ASR	and he's putting together with the information that he has to take all this from this for the old stuff
kansas05a_1047.441_1.51.wav_ASR	it's been erased from
kansas05a_1049.31_24.37.wav_ASR	and the new person is trying to put all of that stuff that she can uh help to uh a preview the two or three different ideas in order to help with the new menus that can begin to help with the idea is there
kansas05a_1090.976_0.51.wav_ASR	ah i don't know
kansas05a_1092.263_0.65.wav_ASR	ah no
kansas05a_1097.783_0.78.wav_ASR	other than real
kansas05a_1103.655_0.4.wav_ASR	oh
kansas05a_1123.313_1.14.wav_ASR	but that should be interesting
kansas05a_1127.098_0.78.wav_ASR	okay so what
kansas05a_1128.523_0.54.wav_ASR	so what
kansas05a_1130.473_0.31.wav_ASR	okay
kansas05a_1189.6_1.38.wav_ASR	but i should take all these
kansas05a_1195.851_0.835.wav_ASR	the look at
kansas05a_1197.755_1.81.wav_ASR	oh i'll never get all that
kansas05a_1203.874_1.92.wav_ASR	uh i was expecting the setting in the in here for
kansas05a_1206.021_1.35.wav_ASR	ah i don't i don't even know
kansas05a_1209.333_2.21.wav_ASR	you know i knew what it was but i don't know
kansas05a_1218.316_0.39.wav_ASR	yes
kansas05a_1223.091_0.33.wav_ASR	yes
kansas05a_1239.87_1.34.wav_ASR	ah i know how i'm doing it
kansas05a_1245.243_11.95.wav_ASR	um a wire butter s water from my money here to get me the kind of thing i want
kansas05a_1257.933_7.82.wav_ASR	put it out the the the amount of uh a little um pri little little problems and uh yeah
kansas05a_1265.928_0.52.wav_ASR	but
kansas05a_1268.256_7.25.wav_ASR	having me have two two plates that too little thing setting on here to to cost for me and and provide
kansas05a_1277.996_5.14.wav_ASR	yeah that's exact i think i just did this the last that last day i was putting on that together
kansas05a_1287.4_6.32.wav_ASR	oh well i have to have the i have the the place right here first
kansas05a_1294.091_1.156.wav_ASR	yeah this
kansas05a_1295.568_3.17.wav_ASR	and then you have to have two euros
kansas05a_1299.11_4.96.wav_ASR	you know you have to two two methods generally for the kind that you're going to have
kansas05a_1304.858_1.94.wav_ASR	and uh then you put it down there
kansas05a_1306.813_9.31.wav_ASR	and you probably have to have something more than just this because it keep it from uh f uh tighter missing
kansas05a_1316.678_5.2.wav_ASR	you have to have a little uh a little here first to keep things working so they get out
kansas05a_1322.798_3.42.wav_ASR	then you have um the first part
kansas05a_1326.278_1.72.wav_ASR	then then you do this part there
kansas05a_1328.518_4.92.wav_ASR	then then you have the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the
kansas05a_1333.611_1.42.wav_ASR	then you have that next one here
kansas05a_1335.05_2.94.wav_ASR	you you merge it out on the in the a top and
kansas05a_1338.036_1.46.wav_ASR	and then you give it to this kind
kansas05a_1340.198_4.1.wav_ASR	and then you then you put it together and then you get three
kempler02a_7.309_0.88.wav_ASR	ah i don't know
kempler02a_10.687_0.94.wav_ASR	it's not
kempler02a_17.217_1.42.wav_ASR	um
kempler02a_21.833_0.55.wav_ASR	that's oh
kempler02a_30.281_14.53.wav_ASR	um um i think um the g um i think um the g um the l. c. d. two years ago

kurland04a_142.047_3.88.wav_ASR	yeah um uh no number of all five
kurland04a_148.292_3.35.wav_ASR	um i was working
kurland04a_151.852_1.09.wav_ASR	and it was a
kurland04a_152.958_1.36.wav_ASR	that i wasn't working at the time
kurland04a_154.335_3.09.wav_ASR	um i um was on a Sunday
kurland04a_157.474_2.18.wav_ASR	and i was
kurland04a_160.138_1.68.wav_ASR	and i went browser shopping
kurland04a_162.283_4.1.wav_ASR	and um i was so tired
kurland04a_166.4_0.98.wav_ASR	that i came on
kurland04a_167.4_1.48.wav_ASR	oh the project
kurland04a_168.9_1.12.wav_ASR	yeah put it all over
kurland04a_170.652_1.69.wav_ASR	and then i yeah
kurland04a_172.62_0.95.wav_ASR	it's okay now
kurland04a_173.692_8.26.wav_ASR	and when i lay down um the right side of my body was was parallel
kurland04a_182.415_3.14.wav_ASR	and i was in another uh conversation
kurland04a_185.7_1.92.wav_ASR	and my husband came home
kurland04a_187.666_3.16.wav_ASR	and i was t unconnected on the floor
kurland04a_191.887_3.83.wav_ASR	so that's that's all i remember you know
kurland04a_195.975_0.33.wav_ASR	so
kurland04a_202.752_16.23.wav_ASR	um i had i was in the household for a week because um part of what happened was that my um the bal um my hair is not clashing
kurland04a_219.0_3.33.wav_ASR	and the blank pulled into
kurland04a_222.345_1.52.wav_ASR	and then it's uh
kurland04a_224.664_0.95.wav_ASR	ah
kurland04a_225.954_2.1.wav_ASR	so they had to uh
kurland04a_228.266_2.79.wav_ASR	and i had um a rib
kurland04a_231.938_6.9.wav_ASR	and so they had to make sure that my fib fib was um stabilised
kurland04a_239.364_2.59.wav_ASR	and so i was in the half for a week
kurland04a_242.0_10.56.wav_ASR	and then they um uh describe me too um presentable
kurland04a_253.376_8.119.wav_ASR	and they they um they did describe me after a week
kurland04a_261.935_9.93.wav_ASR	and then um i went um for um a month um for um a month
kurland04a_272.333_8.66.wav_ASR	and um i took um speech and um oh team
kurland04a_282.007_2.28.wav_ASR	and then um they just charge
kurland04a_284.31_4.33.wav_ASR	and then i went to cool and for my speech
kurland04a_289.838_8.71.wav_ASR	and um i d i try to um talk um whenever i can to help me
kurland04a_298.952_7.62.wav_ASR	and um i went back to speech um after i was disappointed
kurland04a_307.438_4.61.wav_ASR	um
kurland04a_337.311_12.93.wav_ASR	okay um
kurland04a_361.595_5.78.wav_ASR	um well i was thinking about um the day my father died
kurland04a_367.56_1.31.wav_ASR	and i don't know why that came
kurland04a_368.888_3.57.wav_ASR	um but um it was a standard
kurland04a_372.48_1.91.wav_ASR	and my mother was at work
kurland04a_374.455_5.91.wav_ASR	and my phone um went out to to buy a new paper

kurland04a_384.288_4.26.wav_ASR	and i'm i'm i'm asking him what was wrong
kurland04a_388.6_0.46.wav_ASR	oh
kurland04a_389.255_2.63.wav_ASR	nothing i just need to to lay down
kurland04a_392.296_5.18.wav_ASR	so he went into um his um bed and lay down
kurland04a_397.59_7.23.wav_ASR	and then um about an hour later i went in to make sure everything was alright
kurland04a_405.1_3.48.wav_ASR	and um his face look
kurland04a_410.197_4.87.wav_ASR	and um i call the amenities and they came
kurland04a_415.279_6.32.wav_ASR	and um i was the only i was the only person that was at home
kurland04a_421.774_1.23.wav_ASR	so um
kurland04a_423.208_1.88.wav_ASR	that was um
kurland04a_426.243_5.15.wav_ASR	and um and then i call my mother at one
kurland04a_431.444_1.91.wav_ASR	then she came
kurland04a_434.38_0.33.wav_ASR	so
kurland04a_456.58_0.5.wav_ASR	okay
kurland04a_458.348_4.0.wav_ASR	um bob had uh a sack of
kurland04a_462.4_1.41.wav_ASR	uh he was kicking it
kurland04a_464.208_1.58.wav_ASR	and uh it
kurland04a_466.73_1.37.wav_ASR	um he was outside
kurland04a_468.123_3.15.wav_ASR	it's it hit the window in br
kurland04a_471.711_4.45.wav_ASR	and the scale up to the window into the house
kurland04a_476.651_13.69.wav_ASR	and um his father um got the the s the s the s the laptop after it um bumped over the the laptop
kurland04a_505.819_0.68.wav_ASR	okay
kurland04a_506.759_4.57.wav_ASR	um this boy didn't wanna take his animal
kurland04a_511.345_3.939.wav_ASR	um and um his mother wanted him to take it
kurland04a_515.717_2.431.wav_ASR	and then um he said goodbye
kurland04a_518.45_1.76.wav_ASR	and he was walking to school
kurland04a_520.65_1.389.wav_ASR	and it started to rain
kurland04a_522.518_3.16.wav_ASR	and he was um covering his head
kurland04a_526.419_1.87.wav_ASR	and then he ran back on
kurland04a_529.088_3.21.wav_ASR	and his mother got him the animal
kurland04a_532.664_2.4.wav_ASR	and then he walked to school with the animal
kurland04a_547.855_0.55.wav_ASR	okay
kurland04a_549.037_4.01.wav_ASR	um there was a cat that was stuck in the tree
kurland04a_553.763_12.76.wav_ASR	and um the uh the uh the fact that um the fact that the cat
kurland04a_567.307_2.23.wav_ASR	and the later fall over
kurland04a_570.382_2.35.wav_ASR	and the dark dog is barking
kurland04a_573.631_9.28.wav_ASR	and the um the fire fighters uh came with a ladder to help um the guy down
kurland04a_590.495_0.46.wav_ASR	oh
kurland04a_600.918_0.59.wav_ASR	okay and
kurland04a_660.492_0.51.wav_ASR	okay
kurland04a_661.665_12.87.wav_ASR	um sender um led with her um two steps
kurland04a_675.056_5.39.wav_ASR	and they made a look and clean for them
kurland04a_681.291_20.23.wav_ASR	and um the two steps are involved to um a ball at the um a balls
kurland04a_702.428_5.7.wav_ASR	and um and send real was an invite
kurland04a_709.508_4.78.wav_ASR	and oh why she um she got to go
kurland04a_714.335_18.08.wav_ASR	but she um got her g um got her uh um got her
kurland04a_732.436_5.06.wav_ASR	and and she got she turned up on to a camera into a camera
kurland04a_738.103_6.69.wav_ASR	and um the mouse turned in to um costs
kurland04a_745.344_5.73.wav_ASR	and so she went to the the um to the ball
kurland04a_751.942_9.18.wav_ASR	and at the the stroke of twelve his father got her that um she had to be home
kurland04a_761.661_8.66.wav_ASR	and when she was dancing with the price um the clock times twelve
kurland04a_770.678_3.3.wav_ASR	and she ran away from the ball
kurland04a_773.999_2.55.wav_ASR	and she lost her cell
kurland04a_777.536_5.58.wav_ASR	um and then the print um folder
kurland04a_783.409_9.64.wav_ASR	and he um went through the whole children to find the one that that should fit
kurland04a_793.663_1.02.wav_ASR	yeah he did
kurland04a_794.7_3.11.wav_ASR	and he left happily after after
kurland04a_809.524_0.68.wav_ASR	okay
kurland04a_810.552_6.97.wav_ASR	would get myself um uh two pieces of red
kurland04a_818.021_11.44.wav_ASR	and i would uh open the pin button and would script the pinnit button on to one slide with a name
kurland04a_830.112_2.97.wav_ASR	and then i'd open the email
kurland04a_833.701_6.27.wav_ASR	and i would um i would spend the other pieces with yellow
kurland04a_840.752_3.82.wav_ASR	and then i would uh close it into a sale
kurland04a_844.591_1.71.wav_ASR	so then i would cut it in a half
kurland04a_847.004_0.87.wav_ASR	yeah
kurland04b_35.791_0.45.wav_ASR	okay
kurland04b_39.031_2.08.wav_ASR	um i think it's better
kurland04b_42.875_6.42.wav_ASR	um my memory is it is not so good
kurland04b_49.319_6.7.wav_ASR	and i think it's partly uh li partly um my idea
kurland04b_56.393_3.47.wav_ASR	and the other part is um old age
kurland04b_66.151_0.88.wav_ASR	yeah alright
kurland04b_67.456_2.27.wav_ASR	you know
kurland04b_71.984_3.18.wav_ASR	um yeah i had it um it was a standard
kurland04b_75.183_5.56.wav_ASR	and um all week i thought that i was catching the flo
kurland04b_81.01_4.87.wav_ASR	and um i didn't feel right
kurland04b_86.066_1.83.wav_ASR	and i went clothes shopping
kurland04b_87.917_1.1.wav_ASR	yeah i came back
kurland04b_89.062_0.97.wav_ASR	yeah
kurland04b_90.239_1.74.wav_ASR	you need to i need to layout
kurland04b_92.575_1.38.wav_ASR	and went into our bedroom
kurland04b_94.001_2.73.wav_ASR	and um i was on the bed
kurland04b_96.776_7.56.wav_ASR	and the n the next thing i noticed that i had fallen off the bed because my right side is paralyzed
kurland04b_105.14_1.59.wav_ASR	um my husband came in
kurland04b_107.297_3.67.wav_ASR	and um he called the animals
kurland04b_111.019_1.64.wav_ASR	the more the older
kurland04b_121.024_5.06.wav_ASR	um yeah i've had um speech there is
kurland04b_126.17_3.559.wav_ASR	um i had the operation in my head
kurland04b_129.746_2.86.wav_ASR	yeah i didn't have any um
kurland04b_132.621_4.78.wav_ASR	yeah i guess um that um we covered by itself
kurland04b_138.092_15.04.wav_ASR	but um at uh speech there um the the the um gadgets um that i could play me some websites that i could play games on to help my language
kurland04b_153.317_5.67.wav_ASR	and i um i do cross word puzzles
kurland04b_159.539_3.23.wav_ASR	oh i do so
kurland04b_164.717_5.55.wav_ASR	and i had um i had help already here too
kurland04b_195.1_0.33.wav_ASR	yeah
kurland04b_195.728_8.15.wav_ASR	um it it was about christmas time and i had to be two or three or maybe four
kurland04b_204.418_9.37.wav_ASR	but um and i'm not sure whether i remember this or people were telling it so often that i remember it
kurland04b_214.256_6.46.wav_ASR	but um my father used to buy all three of his daughters a Christmas dress
kurland04b_221.109_3.59.wav_ASR	and he would wrap 'em up and put put 'em under the tree
kurland04b_225.267_2.31.wav_ASR	and um somebody was saying
kurland04b_227.736_3.29.wav_ASR	it's a scale this is this is
kurland04b_231.601_11.49.wav_ASR	and um so uh you know he kept telling which part which package was who's
kurland04b_243.417_4.24.wav_ASR	and so um later on i found my package
kurland04b_247.966_3.49.wav_ASR	and i underdid it and put the rest
kurland04b_274.187_0.59.wav_ASR	okay
kurland04b_275.784_3.38.wav_ASR	um there was a boy playing
kurland04b_279.21_1.19.wav_ASR	and he kick the ball
kurland04b_280.601_3.34.wav_ASR	and the ball went through the window
kurland04b_285.546_0.94.wav_ASR	he was outside
kurland04b_286.501_2.07.wav_ASR	he kicked the ball inside
kurland04b_289.17_4.27.wav_ASR	and it it um it not over a label
kurland04b_294.053_5.06.wav_ASR	and his father um was angry
kurland04b_300.412_1.58.wav_ASR	oh no
kurland04b_302.676_5.89.wav_ASR	he picked up the ball and looked through the hole um at his thumb
kurland04b_324.62_0.7.wav_ASR	okay
kurland04b_325.478_5.62.wav_ASR	um the boy who was walking or we'll be leaving his house
kurland04b_332.737_2.95.wav_ASR	and his mother wanted him to take the animal
kurland04b_335.708_1.08.wav_ASR	and he said no
kurland04b_337.284_1.26.wav_ASR	so he left
kurland04b_339.461_2.31.wav_ASR	um his mother wasn't too pleased
kurland04b_342.508_3.26.wav_ASR	and while he was walking to school it's started to range
kurland04b_346.492_1.52.wav_ASR	so he ran back home
kurland04b_348.069_5.04.wav_ASR	and his mother sold him and s and said that he was dead
kurland04b_353.882_7.11.wav_ASR	and he got the animal and walked back to school with the animal
kurland04b_374.405_13.31.wav_ASR	um uh man was um trying to get the cat out of the tree
kurland04b_388.147_1.2.wav_ASR	we had a lot of
kurland04b_389.936_2.71.wav_ASR	and he closed up on to the brand
kurland04b_392.665_2.29.wav_ASR	and the larger fill over
kurland04b_395.678_2.92.wav_ASR	and someone call the fire department
kurland04b_399.132_5.21.wav_ASR	and the fire department came and um got 'em out of the
kurland04b_411.534_0.48.wav_ASR	yeah
kurland04b_418.783_0.42.wav_ASR	okay
kurland04b_501.28_0.938.wav_ASR	oh
kurland04b_502.933_10.18.wav_ASR	um a sign that um marked uh a one who had two children
kurland04b_514.207_23.16.wav_ASR	and so um the um his um his um um
kurland04b_537.717_2.96.wav_ASR	he had to wash the floor
kurland04b_576.021_10.95.wav_ASR	and um so the the two steps um won't gonna allow scenario to come
kurland04b_588.209_21.45.wav_ASR	um so after they left for the ball um sinclair's um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um
kurland04b_610.285_3.9.wav_ASR	and the pump pump in to a carrier
kurland04b_614.697_6.21.wav_ASR	and the rats or mice turned into um the costs
kurland04b_621.488_7.74.wav_ASR	and her very g godmother told her she had to be back home by a minute
kurland04b_629.955_4.56.wav_ASR	and so um she went in the the chair
kurland04b_636.078_5.33.wav_ASR	and um at the ball she met the press
kurland04b_641.783_1.09.wav_ASR	and they dance
kurland04b_643.405_4.44.wav_ASR	and then the clock um charged twelve
kurland04b_648.219_3.82.wav_ASR	and um serial uh name away
kurland04b_652.338_6.83.wav_ASR	and as she ran away her one of her um glasses fill
kurland04b_659.969_1.51.wav_ASR	and the print stuck it up
kurland04b_663.127_2.45.wav_ASR	and so then he
kurland04b_665.948_6.29.wav_ASR	it was the only way that he could find her was through the the glass slip
kurland04b_672.358_3.3.wav_ASR	so he went to everyone's house
kurland04b_676.494_9.98.wav_ASR	and um at cernel's house his um stephan's household had locked her in a room
kurland04b_686.985_3.17.wav_ASR	and the mouse came and gi gave her the key
kurland04b_691.051_8.14.wav_ASR	and then um the print tried the clip on the two steps
kurland04b_699.268_6.01.wav_ASR	and their feet were um too big for the the black l slippery
kurland04b_705.772_6.16.wav_ASR	and then um the colour of the the colours of the remote
kurland04b_711.953_4.78.wav_ASR	and the last slash
kurland04b_717.438_7.39.wav_ASR	and um the print and signal uh were lit happily ever after
kurland04b_737.783_0.71.wav_ASR	okay
kurland04b_739.13_3.31.wav_ASR	and i would get two pieces of red
kurland04b_743.279_3.94.wav_ASR	and i would get out the p. n. butter and the yellow
kurland04b_747.695_7.73.wav_ASR	and then i would write one slide with p. d. b. button and the other slide with yellow
kurland04b_756.291_5.4.wav_ASR	then i would um put the two pieces together
kurland04b_762.256_2.42.wav_ASR	and how it
kurland04b_764.991_0.62.wav_ASR	and
kurland04b_770.477_0.39.wav_ASR	oh
kurland04b_771.798_0.74.wav_ASR	oh
kurland05a_152.51_11.42.wav_ASR	well if i had a c oh let's say uh that's a ten before the stroke i'd say probably maybe a five or a six
kurland05a_170.84_0.89.wav_ASR	oh yeah
kurland05a_173.8_2.07.wav_ASR	yeah that's a hundred and a half room
kurland05a_176.666_5.67.wav_ASR	yeah i'm for a ride my dog
kurland05a_182.382_2.67.wav_ASR	he was uh about forty years old then
kurland05a_185.106_6.18.wav_ASR	it's he had down sender so it wasn't fifty
kurland05a_191.809_0.48.wav_ASR	but
kurland05a_193.024_1.21.wav_ASR	the one for a rat
kurland05a_194.282_4.53.wav_ASR	it's doing alright uh s something you c
kurland05a_198.988_5.04.wav_ASR	yeah i couldn't i couldn't uh think straight
kurland05a_204.622_1.36.wav_ASR	yeah
kurland05a_206.0_7.82.wav_ASR	uh i was working on my right side my my right hand uh
kurland05a_214.253_10.25.wav_ASR	and uh i has it turned out my speech is oh but a two or a scale of one and a ten maybe a bit too a one
kurland05a_224.887_1.16.wav_ASR	that was a key
kurland05a_226.186_1.23.wav_ASR	and the remote control
kurland05a_227.514_1.77.wav_ASR	uh i set down
kurland05a_229.301_2.07.wav_ASR	it's about three and a half three dollars
kurland05a_233.454_3.19.wav_ASR	oh i'd like that to be
kurland05a_236.666_2.23.wav_ASR	yeah in a lot that's it's a problem
kurland05a_239.553_2.92.wav_ASR	then it's my wife is saying
kurland05a_242.497_0.96.wav_ASR	the form
kurland05a_243.476_2.08.wav_ASR	and i know uh it's something wrong
kurland05a_245.637_2.84.wav_ASR	so i'd get a third
kurland05a_248.5_4.2.wav_ASR	oh i s i could get yeah
kurland05a_253.449_5.039.wav_ASR	and the person i don't know wha yeah i don't know wha who is but she's
kurland05a_258.926_0.77.wav_ASR	take you or
kurland05a_259.718_0.4.wav_ASR	yes
kurland05a_260.801_1.56.wav_ASR	oh it's that's that's a r
kurland05a_262.38_1.63.wav_ASR	oh
kurland05a_264.131_0.78.wav_ASR	think
kurland05a_265.201_4.64.wav_ASR	uh but she is you know so she's
kurland05a_271.108_7.69.wav_ASR	uh i'm talking about yeah because then it's not that's yeah
kurland05a_279.654_5.22.wav_ASR	so i thought of go away and think a little bit
kurland05a_285.064_4.19.wav_ASR	so we'll then uh the absolute um
kurland05a_290.627_4.48.wav_ASR	uh we want to have a hell of a money
kurland05a_295.586_1.9.wav_ASR	it tried to work and then money
kurland05a_298.262_0.91.wav_ASR	and
kurland05a_300.327_6.55.wav_ASR	and i d i drew my draw from h. m. mas you know all the way up to a channel you're on
kurland05a_307.424_2.24.wav_ASR	it's okay
kurland05a_310.553_6.46.wav_ASR	and then uh on the way out it's uh kicked into the right
kurland05a_317.918_3.01.wav_ASR	yeah the rubber strip you know
kurland05a_321.108_4.34.wav_ASR	let's i'll go on to the road then a symbol kinetic
kurland05a_326.11_8.58.wav_ASR	that point they're i got something wrong you know so that's yeah
kurland05a_335.758_3.8.wav_ASR	so i uh that's that's the day i told my wife
kurland05a_340.564_1.36.wav_ASR	it's
kurland05a_342.93_1.48.wav_ASR	and one day i told my wife
kurland05a_344.754_2.02.wav_ASR	yeah
kurland05a_346.798_14.85.wav_ASR	oh since it was yeah the whole day you have to the colours within three hours that you have to change that
kurland05a_362.512_4.01.wav_ASR	and it is the other part of the bar but i say that
kurland05a_367.407_2.24.wav_ASR	and uh i took the image
kurland05a_369.736_4.53.wav_ASR	and yeah yeah it's you have to speech therapy and yeah uh
kurland05a_375.33_1.04.wav_ASR	there's two of those
kurland05a_376.429_0.74.wav_ASR	oh
kurland05a_377.191_1.66.wav_ASR	but those last in the refrigerator
kurland05a_378.867_3.56.wav_ASR	yeah but it's a speech stereo yeah that's three more months
kurland05a_383.2_3.25.wav_ASR	by the uh my uh television that you
kurland05a_386.799_2.27.wav_ASR	think you you reached the your patrol
kurland05a_389.246_3.71.wav_ASR	it's a r oh and uh i don't know
kurland05a_393.01_3.82.wav_ASR	oh it's in the script in the script
kurland05a_396.85_2.72.wav_ASR	it's i flattened you know after six months
kurland05a_399.661_4.34.wav_ASR	and now it's six and a half years later i'm still plotted
kurland05a_421.506_4.57.wav_ASR	um one thing that was quite clear i was very tight
kurland05a_426.134_3.9.wav_ASR	so you use it six hours a little bit more than nine you know
kurland05a_430.627_6.75.wav_ASR	it probably wouldn't to uh nine hours yeah and with an in the afternoon for like a half an hour
kurland05a_439.185_11.7.wav_ASR	ah yeah in my therapy i told uh my therapist oh that's a sale
kurland05a_450.9_1.92.wav_ASR	but she uh
kurland05a_453.377_9.07.wav_ASR	and the other way i could uh you use the curve curves you know for example
kurland05a_463.012_4.16.wav_ASR	or you could uh have a paper in the paper shape
kurland05a_467.738_5.68.wav_ASR	but i c it was not able to uh really talk yeah
kurland05a_475.53_10.57.wav_ASR	just this way i can describe things um yeah if i was a thirty five uh r. p. m. recorder
kurland05a_486.35_2.39.wav_ASR	just can get another wait
kurland05a_489.477_14.42.wav_ASR	and uh it's not quite so bad in all directions uh i just wanna put it
kurland05a_504.51_7.96.wav_ASR	uh very much like nowadays there's there's t yeah okay
kurland05a_515.462_0.671.wav_ASR	it's a bit
kurland05a_554.732_7.46.wav_ASR	well i have a lot of uh i have a lot of uh
kurland05a_564.856_3.3.wav_ASR	my stroke took uh place uh email for
kurland05a_568.92_6.03.wav_ASR	and uh my physical year ended uh autumn first you f sorry
kurland05a_575.71_0.86.wav_ASR	and it was i th
kurland05a_576.684_1.21.wav_ASR	whoa
kurland05a_578.401_1.34.wav_ASR	hey like five minutes to go
kurland05a_579.76_4.27.wav_ASR	oh that's i was uh had on all my cables
kurland05a_584.704_4.17.wav_ASR	so i i want a fruit to uh a colour screen
kurland05a_589.765_1.96.wav_ASR	and uh that's true
kurland05a_592.346_2.85.wav_ASR	that's why it's why it's why it's
kurland05a_595.53_1.56.wav_ASR	oh i took all the sound
kurland05a_601.36_2.91.wav_ASR	yeah that's true
kurland05a_604.371_11.19.wav_ASR	um oh when i got up to accept the the order i sort of
kurland05a_622.298_0.93.wav_ASR	and
kurland05a_624.482_0.93.wav_ASR	it never uses your cradle
kurland05a_630.564_8.41.wav_ASR	but uh it's just something that they that the added battery or a lot of rubber
kurland05a_639.446_6.27.wav_ASR	and uh that's you can see it's uh c continue to stay with me
kurland05a_649.2_2.38.wav_ASR	yeah
kurland05a_653.67_4.13.wav_ASR	and here uh amazing grade at a final
kurland05a_662.527_0.85.wav_ASR	to
kurland05a_666.225_1.64.wav_ASR	oh the screen
kurland05a_668.408_6.34.wav_ASR	because yeah i believe the crack in the roof or something
kurland05a_674.801_6.03.wav_ASR	uh yeah it's pretty uh very accurate
kurland05a_685.515_3.9.wav_ASR	oh
kurland05a_690.856_2.46.wav_ASR	yeah the t. v. remote
kurland05a_695.249_3.53.wav_ASR	it might be some stupid
kurland05a_700.718_10.62.wav_ASR	if i can't send a signal
kurland05a_712.137_5.12.wav_ASR	yeah i don't know why it's but i can't get over yeah
kurland05a_717.971_2.22.wav_ASR	it's it's it's very long
kurland05a_722.507_2.3.wav_ASR	well uh my favourite friends
kurland05a_725.084_2.06.wav_ASR	the
kurland05a_727.159_0.59.wav_ASR	oh
kurland05a_736.401_0.79.wav_ASR	uh no no
kurland05a_767.64_0.42.wav_ASR	oh
kurland05a_768.713_6.43.wav_ASR	oh this comes uh r oh
kurland05a_775.731_4.04.wav_ASR	and uh the first picture shows a a young guy playing soccer
kurland05a_780.772_0.81.wav_ASR	he keeps the ball
kurland05a_781.6_6.34.wav_ASR	and uh he must be f too close to the house because uh he put it on the wall
kurland05a_789.212_6.9.wav_ASR	and uh as long as it the home or something like that
kurland05a_796.131_4.91.wav_ASR	and you're not the window over it's too a lamp over the lamp over the lamp over the lamp over the lamp over the lamp over the lamp over the lamp over the lamp over the lamp over the lamp over the lamp over the lamp over the lamp over the lamp
kurland05a_801.46_2.26.wav_ASR	it's it's it's
kurland05a_804.612_7.97.wav_ASR	and uh the last uh picture shows the whole world in the scale model
kurland05a_812.6_5.26.wav_ASR	so i can only imagine that there is one
kurland05a_855.661_3.73.wav_ASR	well i guess it shows a one and uh probably your son
kurland05a_860.063_1.44.wav_ASR	and he must to go outside again
kurland05a_862.307_0.51.wav_ASR	which is
kurland05a_862.998_2.06.wav_ASR	take your b well you go
kurland05a_865.108_1.27.wav_ASR	let's let's take it
kurland05a_867.751_2.56.wav_ASR	it's your task to um twice i guess
kurland05a_870.393_1.62.wav_ASR	let's let's take it
kurland05a_872.035_0.74.wav_ASR	that's right
kurland05a_872.828_3.42.wav_ASR	the third picture shows
kurland05a_876.326_4.09.wav_ASR	the format should be
kurland05a_882.162_1.98.wav_ASR	so we can't backside
kurland05a_884.93_0.85.wav_ASR	and well let's see
kurland05a_885.939_0.89.wav_ASR	oh i told you so
kurland05a_886.879_5.12.wav_ASR	um the last project shows it with uh oh well like it should have had the first place
kurland05a_903.958_0.5.wav_ASR	oh
kurland05a_916.499_3.08.wav_ASR	well apparently a cat
kurland05a_919.6_3.77.wav_ASR	and as cats are poor on the do can't get down
kurland05a_925.566_9.21.wav_ASR	and uh a whole other company yeah um a mail order and he could get it in the three and he could get it in either
kurland05a_936.567_1.42.wav_ASR	the girl's crying for a cat
kurland05a_939.74_3.82.wav_ASR	uh oh the
kurland05a_944.348_0.99.wav_ASR	so he's stuck in this triangle
kurland05a_945.353_5.63.wav_ASR	and the dog uh you know break it the cat and the the canine
kurland05a_951.07_3.66.wav_ASR	so guess we know why the cat is up in the tree
kurland05a_955.677_6.53.wav_ASR	and anyway uh it shows the white part of the screen that you got the cat down and the guy
kurland05a_965.049_1.31.wav_ASR	this one
kurland05a_992.053_3.05.wav_ASR	oh my son
kurland05a_997.143_0.83.wav_ASR	you you want
kurland05a_998.255_3.97.wav_ASR	you you watch it all the all the designs yeah over and over again
kurland05a_1003.251_2.88.wav_ASR	uh i mean oh not that much i mean
kurland05a_1008.346_1.36.wav_ASR	it's forty fifty times yeah
kurland05a_1011.908_1.15.wav_ASR	ah
kurland05a_1016.878_9.9.wav_ASR	well uh i was so many remotes for the uh signal uh
kurland05a_1041.624_0.32.wav_ASR	yeah
kurland05a_1045.64_1.219.wav_ASR	oh
kurland05a_1049.637_0.39.wav_ASR	oh
kurland05a_1129.285_5.26.wav_ASR	it's gonna be my birthday it's gonna be very short
kurland05a_1136.092_2.46.wav_ASR	uh it starts off with the end goal
kurland05a_1138.93_1.73.wav_ASR	it think she has two cells maybe
kurland05a_1140.678_8.22.wav_ASR	and she's the leader uh of the other three even though she's the yeah
kurland05a_1150.4_1.95.wav_ASR	for better is uh even worse
kurland05a_1152.368_6.1.wav_ASR	it's yeah i th yeah
kurland05a_1159.027_3.22.wav_ASR	then you will uh
kurland05a_1163.206_2.53.wav_ASR	there he wants to go
kurland05a_1165.752_0.99.wav_ASR	oh it could
kurland05a_1166.764_5.58.wav_ASR	but s some of sh she got to go to that the ball
kurland05a_1172.459_3.71.wav_ASR	then it's at the ball there's a print there
kurland05a_1177.292_2.11.wav_ASR	and uh i think it's a slider
kurland05a_1179.426_3.52.wav_ASR	uh try to slip around that
kurland05a_1183.783_5.14.wav_ASR	and uh as long we have it the scenario
kurland05a_1190.594_3.78.wav_ASR	and anyway uh i hope i'll be able to
kurland05a_1194.524_3.16.wav_ASR	so i think uh they're happy ever after
kurland05a_1201.033_0.43.wav_ASR	the uh
kurland05a_1220.688_0.84.wav_ASR	that's pretty easy
kurland05a_1222.699_3.27.wav_ASR	how would take uh the battery that size
kurland05a_1227.109_5.61.wav_ASR	and i use only r. s uh whole reds because that's helpful for my son
kurland05a_1234.237_4.55.wav_ASR	yeah i can't say this is for six months now
kurland05a_1239.613_1.78.wav_ASR	that's the p. l. c. d.
kurland05a_1241.442_5.12.wav_ASR	oh yeah that's a good bit of two pieces of rubber bracket
kurland05a_1247.075_1.39.wav_ASR	the table
kurland05a_1249.538_2.64.wav_ASR	and the one i put the gelli
kurland05a_1252.921_0.81.wav_ASR	yeah
kurland05a_1254.656_4.23.wav_ASR	and then i put a screw uh on the other side
kurland05a_1259.156_3.63.wav_ASR	put a piece of rubber together
kurland05a_1262.831_7.23.wav_ASR	then i cut on four pieces 'cause uh that's too big
kurland05a_1270.32_5.5.wav_ASR	and then i uh have uh all pages that you you have it
kurland05a_1275.84_2.65.wav_ASR	uh they include it in the summary
kurland05a_1278.506_3.21.wav_ASR	and i'm not really going
kurland05b_50.075_4.4.wav_ASR	my speech is uh that's just said it's probably yeah
kurland05b_56.5_10.98.wav_ASR	it yeah it's uh like a single one a ten be it's not a three or four to a seven
kurland05b_68.384_18.84.wav_ASR	and um um the pen is a pen that you know it's a pen that you can't really say i have a seven or uh yeah down as well as a three or four
kurland05b_97.474_0.39.wav_ASR	oh yeah
kurland05b_101.171_8.37.wav_ASR	oh um my scroll and a f a spongy double that i think it was
kurland05b_110.667_3.95.wav_ASR	people's third um in the afternoon
kurland05b_115.886_5.05.wav_ASR	oh it's uh taking my son uh kenny for a ride in the trunk
kurland05b_121.942_7.89.wav_ASR	and sometimes during write uh
kurland05b_131.038_7.6.wav_ASR	and uh r red button
kurland05b_138.764_4.16.wav_ASR	and uh i know something wrong but that's not something
kurland05b_144.024_7.14.wav_ASR	so not all my wife i didn't say anything to my wife uh the rest is a story
kurland05b_151.185_2.78.wav_ASR	and uh yeah that's it
kurland05b_153.981_3.23.wav_ASR	yeah
kurland05b_158.031_2.08.wav_ASR	oh like normal
kurland05b_161.057_5.69.wav_ASR	and uh draw it in the word because my right side is affected
kurland05b_166.826_2.53.wav_ASR	uh the left side is i think it's
kurland05b_169.989_2.67.wav_ASR	keep dropping it out the the scale
kurland05b_173.568_4.83.wav_ASR	um i got a master's degree in speechable
kurland05b_179.316_1.64.wav_ASR	and i keep going over the rubber
kurland05b_182.108_9.76.wav_ASR	and then i don't can't talk anymore about my speech and you know it but just have something on my speech and you know
kurland05b_191.892_5.03.wav_ASR	so i uh i picked up some corner c. that i sold these two parameters
kurland05b_196.973_3.33.wav_ASR	and uh i got the current sheet on my desk
kurland05b_200.538_0.84.wav_ASR	forty pages
kurland05b_201.657_1.03.wav_ASR	then i came back
kurland05b_203.698_3.23.wav_ASR	then i uh got up and uh welcome
kurland05b_207.883_1.73.wav_ASR	the drawable can't be
kurland05b_210.089_2.3.wav_ASR	that's the same thing happened down there
kurland05b_212.464_1.61.wav_ASR	it's going on the right
kurland05b_215.133_5.91.wav_ASR	oh now on a scale I'm gonna write up on my drawing
kurland05b_221.891_4.39.wav_ASR	that point that sh i figured out
kurland05b_226.335_2.1.wav_ASR	so i uh
kurland05b_229.055_2.63.wav_ASR	the about two and a half yeah that's long
kurland05b_231.708_2.62.wav_ASR	but i'd like to start with a fourth
kurland05b_234.375_2.94.wav_ASR	oh the phone rang
kurland05b_237.33_1.8.wav_ASR	oh this is the next project
kurland05b_239.747_1.31.wav_ASR	yeah the phone's already here
kurland05b_241.287_2.06.wav_ASR	the white is like twelve and a half
kurland05b_244.599_0.87.wav_ASR	the answer
kurland05b_245.491_5.89.wav_ASR	um i s i think it's a low um maybe one or two third world
kurland05b_251.454_3.41.wav_ASR	and f what the person want on the line is it
kurland05b_256.869_0.559.wav_ASR	that was wrong
kurland05b_258.3_6.88.wav_ASR	oh the person on the other side is it is it's a feel
kurland05b_266.088_0.42.wav_ASR	the sh
kurland05b_266.653_0.63.wav_ASR	think you have a shot
kurland05b_267.375_0.45.wav_ASR	so should
kurland05b_268.156_0.55.wav_ASR	the way
kurland05b_268.782_0.81.wav_ASR	so let's see
kurland05b_269.867_0.57.wav_ASR	yeah but uh
kurland05b_271.723_3.86.wav_ASR	uh my wife is the problem yes that that i had yeah
kurland05b_275.899_1.1.wav_ASR	so one of the assets
kurland05b_277.016_4.1.wav_ASR	um uh yeah
kurland05b_281.136_4.44.wav_ASR	but it was you know over three hours so the cap is already on that
kurland05b_293.567_4.82.wav_ASR	well i want to speech stereo and application therapy
kurland05b_298.403_8.73.wav_ASR	the the p. t. and uh the calculation theory probably won't uh like three or four sentences easy
kurland05b_307.193_2.73.wav_ASR	and uh we yeah the p
kurland05b_310.082_0.64.wav_ASR	okay
kurland05b_310.745_2.93.wav_ASR	you know
kurland05b_313.825_2.57.wav_ASR	uh that's not a problem
kurland05b_318.388_3.05.wav_ASR	oh it's catchy better than my right hand
kurland05b_321.457_1.7.wav_ASR	so let's let's see
kurland05b_323.705_0.63.wav_ASR	the cover
kurland05b_324.657_3.95.wav_ASR	then it's the speech there must be three months
kurland05b_333.208_9.89.wav_ASR	uh yeah i can say that uh it's like a three one i started talking you know a seven or eight
kurland05b_343.549_1.79.wav_ASR	it's a combination
kurland05b_346.177_4.96.wav_ASR	and that's the that that time there uh oh no that's
kurland05b_352.43_0.71.wav_ASR	the black
kurland05b_353.164_2.95.wav_ASR	yeah so i'm i start going on to there
kurland05b_356.174_4.04.wav_ASR	oh oh this is she should write it
kurland05b_360.291_2.51.wav_ASR	yeah i never got a sheet fully back
kurland05b_370.449_0.36.wav_ASR	yeah
kurland05b_373.581_7.66.wav_ASR	it it's it's uh it's better but i i don't feel it's uh yeah anyway newer
kurland05b_381.259_2.16.wav_ASR	oh
kurland05b_383.436_2.84.wav_ASR	that was you know a little jokes and
kurland05b_386.57_0.47.wav_ASR	and uh
kurland05b_387.861_3.22.wav_ASR	yeah i th that was pretty good sellable
kurland05b_391.097_4.98.wav_ASR	yeah it's i'd i'd keep the project manager you know
kurland05b_396.1_1.46.wav_ASR	oh
kurland05b_401.115_6.28.wav_ASR	let's see uh yeah after i'm the remote i continued to work s 'cause my email in in null folder
kurland05b_408.444_4.29.wav_ASR	and uh i want to uh a meeting on the
kurland05b_413.53_1.25.wav_ASR	it's a bit out of
kurland05b_414.87_1.34.wav_ASR	think
kurland05b_416.983_7.74.wav_ASR	and anyway uh they had a crash and the cordless you know
kurland05b_425.712_2.42.wav_ASR	the anyway uh the
kurland05b_428.562_3.89.wav_ASR	and they could answer questions in all my papers you know
kurland05b_432.845_1.68.wav_ASR	it has to be the ex
kurland05b_435.581_2.4.wav_ASR	yeah that's
kurland05b_438.0_1.17.wav_ASR	uh it's really impressive
kurland05b_440.451_5.79.wav_ASR	yeah i uh i i don't grasp much as uh as you use to grasp it's not
kurland05b_448.71_3.71.wav_ASR	just the t. v. screen
kurland05b_453.297_5.68.wav_ASR	so i think a core you know save curve
kurland05b_459.001_5.15.wav_ASR	oh yeah i d oh one of the three people you know
kurland05b_465.42_4.07.wav_ASR	and they're done a long time ago for me
kurland05b_470.732_2.86.wav_ASR	oh the first thing is that that's the third time of the test
kurland05b_473.683_3.87.wav_ASR	and you know s some of those people that were there for for example only
kurland05b_478.908_4.73.wav_ASR	so again it's you know that's the same as the same as the same
kurland05b_486.315_0.97.wav_ASR	but you can just look
kurland05b_487.3_0.41.wav_ASR	so
kurland05b_521.35_5.4.wav_ASR	yeah
kurland05b_528.086_12.14.wav_ASR	when i'm in the second grade a little kid so it's probably one year old seventy two
kurland05b_541.171_8.04.wav_ASR	and anyway it's uh it was uh s some kind of contrast uh put on by some western t. v. show
kurland05b_549.936_8.21.wav_ASR	and anyway i want to uh myself for uh my two parents to uh friend's party
kurland05b_558.463_2.43.wav_ASR	it's it won't work there
kurland05b_562.292_2.8.wav_ASR	yeah we
kurland05b_565.11_1.13.wav_ASR	but i don't think so
kurland05b_566.959_0.5.wav_ASR	we got it
kurland05b_567.474_5.55.wav_ASR	and uh the guy that is our guide for the he's a guide for the
kurland05b_573.948_2.22.wav_ASR	yeah
kurland05b_577.382_0.79.wav_ASR	oh no forget that
kurland05b_578.302_2.27.wav_ASR	but i think it's time
kurland05b_582.487_1.86.wav_ASR	the no take it all out
kurland05b_584.365_5.0.wav_ASR	uh in uh in a in a in a
kurland05b_589.647_1.44.wav_ASR	yeah that's right
kurland05b_591.776_2.55.wav_ASR	think that's a that's a long time ago now
kurland05b_624.232_0.39.wav_ASR	okay
kurland05b_628.176_4.47.wav_ASR	well little guy is playing soccer or kick ball on the friday yeah
kurland05b_632.7_2.8.wav_ASR	and he kicks the ball to
kurland05b_635.545_6.32.wav_ASR	and unfortunately he goes through the window uh either his house or neighbours house
kurland05b_642.769_3.78.wav_ASR	it lands in the and uh
kurland05b_646.929_1.83.wav_ASR	now's up a lamp and scratches that
kurland05b_649.915_2.18.wav_ASR	and the guy who wants to listen to that
kurland05b_653.528_0.75.wav_ASR	joost
kurland05b_655.706_1.96.wav_ASR	um he looks outside
kurland05b_657.905_0.67.wav_ASR	it's
kurland05b_658.598_2.16.wav_ASR	oh that's the
kurland05b_661.683_0.79.wav_ASR	chill is out
kurland05b_675.398_0.57.wav_ASR	but
kurland05b_688.437_3.84.wav_ASR	well again little j. is uh
kurland05b_692.452_0.73.wav_ASR	and that's it
kurland05b_693.436_0.72.wav_ASR	it's not
kurland05b_694.205_1.17.wav_ASR	that's the reason
kurland05b_696.756_1.71.wav_ASR	oh no that's that's gonna be fine
kurland05b_698.991_1.28.wav_ASR	let's uh
kurland05b_701.547_4.48.wav_ASR	and that's right on this calculation always 'cause that's
kurland05b_707.255_1.58.wav_ASR	the
kurland05b_709.681_0.62.wav_ASR	because
kurland05b_710.322_2.75.wav_ASR	um
kurland05b_713.094_1.1.wav_ASR	that's my scroll
kurland05b_714.345_3.63.wav_ASR	uh next time we go to school it takes an hour
kurland05b_744.592_1.132.wav_ASR	yeah
kurland05b_755.253_4.52.wav_ASR	well a little curves probably yeah outline or triangle
kurland05b_759.794_2.18.wav_ASR	oh
kurland05b_761.996_4.72.wav_ASR	and the dog uh changes the cat
kurland05b_768.041_7.81.wav_ASR	and then uh um for the falter or for some older gentleman tries to get the cat down from the tree
kurland05b_776.416_4.18.wav_ASR	and anyway s the later falls down on the three so he's stuck too
kurland05b_781.781_5.59.wav_ASR	then the fire battery's come and the second later on the cat down and the cat down
kurland05b_796.879_0.58.wav_ASR	oh no
kurland05b_803.106_0.41.wav_ASR	yeah
kurland05b_807.665_0.38.wav_ASR	oh
kurland05b_815.154_0.57.wav_ASR	that's okay
kurland05b_909.402_3.36.wav_ASR	it's a part of time there is a curve
kurland05b_913.675_7.88.wav_ASR	sh he's two thirds not very good in a little bit of a guess
kurland05b_922.524_6.82.wav_ASR	and uh there's a b a ball or something
kurland05b_930.118_7.16.wav_ASR	and uh the the and uh two girls one of the boys
kurland05b_938.355_5.11.wav_ASR	and they told sender i'll stay on the floor 'cause it they're all dead
kurland05b_945.465_0.99.wav_ASR	then we'll stay on
kurland05b_946.474_3.95.wav_ASR	and um somehow she found the
kurland05b_950.444_4.35.wav_ASR	or something
kurland05b_955.569_3.66.wav_ASR	and he's she got to the goal
kurland05b_960.256_15.48.wav_ASR	and uh and yeah that's in the bottom so it's got a curve that's made up of a paper or whatever
kurland05b_976.988_3.15.wav_ASR	yeah
kurland05b_981.967_7.69.wav_ASR	it's the the p the the the car turned to a p back into a pittsburgh to a pittsburgh to a pittsburgh to a pittsburgh to a pittsburgh to a pittsburgh to a pittsburgh to a pittsburgh
kurland05b_991.035_2.82.wav_ASR	then we'll have me me me time now
kurland05b_994.22_9.66.wav_ASR	it's she uh took out the ball before minute so she wouldn't turn into a p uh into a p uh into a p uh into a p uh into a p uh into a p uh into a p uh into a p uh into a p uh into a p uh into a p uh into a p uh into a p uh into a p uh into a p uh into a p
kurland05b_1004.309_1.67.wav_ASR	and i guess you lost a slider
kurland05b_1006.874_2.58.wav_ASR	and well she was there she was dancing with the hands
kurland05b_1009.716_4.87.wav_ASR	and he always the print you know got oh all the supplements
kurland05b_1014.608_2.97.wav_ASR	oh he liked in his own project work
kurland05b_1017.86_5.95.wav_ASR	you have a you have a uh oh a shooting
kurland05b_1024.992_3.069.wav_ASR	wherever where is it
kurland05b_1028.833_4.409.wav_ASR	and the result is
kurland05b_1035.181_0.6.wav_ASR	the
kurland05b_1035.799_1.43.wav_ASR	and we left happily after
kurland05b_1048.697_0.45.wav_ASR	oh
kurland05b_1055.422_0.45.wav_ASR	okay
kurland05b_1056.34_1.33.wav_ASR	take two pieces of bread
kurland05b_1059.379_1.51.wav_ASR	yeah the same table
kurland05b_1061.055_8.55.wav_ASR	yeah put um the spindly bit of rubber the smooth version 'cause that it's not pressed so well
kurland05b_1070.403_1.97.wav_ASR	it's a bit on the red
kurland05b_1073.065_1.85.wav_ASR	but that's one and a half
kurland05b_1074.939_11.48.wav_ASR	and then uh other half uh i use it's like that's made the buttons
kurland05b_1086.976_1.86.wav_ASR	the other uh on the other feet
kurland05b_1088.915_1.73.wav_ASR	uh just slap it together
kurland05b_1091.815_1.39.wav_ASR	and i have cut that yeah
kurland05b_1093.315_1.94.wav_ASR	then you go
kurland05b_1101.168_0.35.wav_ASR	yeah
kurland08a_40.815_26.38.wav_ASR	um i don't um
kurland08a_81.459_20.65.wav_ASR	um it was in my mind so that's um i can't remember

kurland08b_855.827_1.32.wav_ASR	and she's got
kurland08b_884.806_9.37.wav_ASR	um the cat is up on the triangle
kurland08b_895.322_7.53.wav_ASR	and the data's um crying
kurland08b_906.846_9.94.wav_ASR	the p the part and he gets up and he gets stuck in a brand
kurland08b_924.917_8.92.wav_ASR	um that
kurland08b_942.81_16.07.wav_ASR	oh um the the the on the and he lost it
kurland08b_964.127_9.03.wav_ASR	um the favourite part comes running
kurland08b_973.365_16.3.wav_ASR	and um um they're about to save the man in the cat
kurland08b_997.905_12.36.wav_ASR	the dog is
kurland08b_1014.193_10.559.wav_ASR	he doesn't want to see the man or the cat in the tray

kurland08b_1363.0_3.63.wav_ASR	um system
kurland08b_1368.763_8.81.wav_ASR	and um um she's um
kurland08b_1390.31_5.42.wav_ASR	ah
kurland08b_1396.73_5.87.wav_ASR	um let's um
kurland08b_1405.54_28.46.wav_ASR	and they um like um like um
kurland08b_1504.87_5.76.wav_ASR	and the scenario was the only one that uh that
kurland08b_1512.49_20.87.wav_ASR	um she gets invited to the presentations
kurland08b_1574.49_7.45.wav_ASR	um and they go to the wall
kurland08b_1583.778_15.03.wav_ASR	and the prints falls in lump with the s signal uh
kurland08b_1599.97_16.46.wav_ASR	um um she has a um
kurland08b_1628.301_10.38.wav_ASR	she loses the glass on the way
kurland08b_1639.88_20.47.wav_ASR	um she gets on and the
kurland08b_1662.866_10.06.wav_ASR	um the the the the the hands is pages
kurland08b_1676.48_21.89.wav_ASR	the curve um uh with the black slider and it um tries it on um trials and it doesn't fit
kurland08b_1699.203_8.61.wav_ASR	and then he tries it on standard uh but and it fits
kurland08b_1708.86_20.77.wav_ASR	and um the pen
kurland08b_1734.021_1.03.wav_ASR	oh god
kurland08b_1752.474_12.45.wav_ASR	um you would take bright from uh logo and lay it on the cover
kurland08b_1766.32_16.78.wav_ASR	um you would take g um you would take the
kurland08b_1784.997_15.76.wav_ASR	and um put the j. on one side of the logo on one side of the logo
kurland08b_1812.23_14.81.wav_ASR	ah you would pad the jelly on one side of the um
kurland08b_1850.9_1.69.wav_ASR	it can't remember
kurland08b_1856.97_8.36.wav_ASR	you would put the channel on one side of the
kurland08b_1875.399_6.42.wav_ASR	and put the pen on the other side
kurland08b_1887.643_5.46.wav_ASR	and then you slap them too
kurland08b_1897.399_0.71.wav_ASR	yeah
kurland08c_74.24_9.26.wav_ASR	um i thought that part is
kurland08c_83.551_11.2.wav_ASR	um i uh i'd i'd i'd i'd i'd
kurland08c_95.94_13.55.wav_ASR	and um the um the um words
kurland08c_188.37_12.54.wav_ASR	and uh words i'm um um
kurland08c_204.914_7.58.wav_ASR	geen is sending me words every day
kurland08c_213.19_14.53.wav_ASR	and um i um the words that i used um the words that i used to now
kurland08c_237.253_17.22.wav_ASR	uh that's um in touch with that i could be um in touch with
kurland08c_260.106_0.42.wav_ASR	yeah
kurland08c_262.13_0.37.wav_ASR	yeah
kurland08c_264.15_0.46.wav_ASR	yeah
kurland08c_269.297_8.41.wav_ASR	um i would um
kurland08c_278.737_2.0.wav_ASR	oh i can't print
kurland08c_284.154_1.07.wav_ASR	so oh
kurland08c_291.35_0.42.wav_ASR	yeah
kurland08c_328.146_11.0.wav_ASR	the voice is picking the s colour and it crashes into a window
kurland08c_374.928_5.44.wav_ASR	um it notes over the
kurland08c_381.955_19.39.wav_ASR	he and he's um looks out the ball in his pocket
kurland08c_413.277_1.1.wav_ASR	it's not
kurland08c_431.213_12.8.wav_ASR	um
kurland08c_444.832_2.74.wav_ASR	and he says
kurland08c_447.909_1.34.wav_ASR	oh don't need
kurland08c_451.178_10.5.wav_ASR	then one that um it's raring and poor
kurland08c_462.05_12.71.wav_ASR	and um he's got the um he's got the
kurland08c_477.194_3.22.wav_ASR	and he's on his
kurland08c_487.798_10.88.wav_ASR	then it looks the important but she gets the inkwell
kurland08c_542.158_1.93.wav_ASR	why not
kurland08c_544.347_6.94.wav_ASR	he goes out side
kurland08c_552.901_0.43.wav_ASR	okay
kurland08c_557.162_0.7.wav_ASR	oh
kurland08c_561.08_6.73.wav_ASR	um the curve is missing a card
kurland08c_568.691_5.56.wav_ASR	and uh he looks up and then
kurland08c_576.022_2.4.wav_ASR	and there is a
kurland08c_581.224_15.74.wav_ASR	the the in to the triangle and uh lines up into the triangle and the lot
kurland08c_599.216_27.06.wav_ASR	um he's okay 'cause the man can't get any because the man can't get any
kurland08c_627.646_17.28.wav_ASR	um
kurland08c_646.178_6.5.wav_ASR	um the fire in the room comes
kurland08c_653.497_29.91.wav_ASR	and um
kurland08c_714.397_7.21.wav_ASR	the man can can line down
kurland08c_730.275_8.56.wav_ASR	it looks as if that curve is
kurland08c_739.757_12.65.wav_ASR	and oh she's um
kurland08c_910.859_3.82.wav_ASR	oh
kurland08c_917.634_0.48.wav_ASR	yeah

kurland21e_1136.765_1.54.wav_ASR	oh
kurland21e_1138.812_1.08.wav_ASR	and of course
MSU02a_25.604_2.86.wav_ASR	um i think it's better than it was
MSU02a_29.058_5.49.wav_ASR	uh i think i have um a lot to um progress
MSU02a_34.948_1.18.wav_ASR	and i have to press a lot
MSU02a_40.056_0.82.wav_ASR	yeah
MSU02a_43.272_2.28.wav_ASR	um and i had the script
MSU02a_46.003_2.03.wav_ASR	um it was earlier in the morning
MSU02a_48.558_1.53.wav_ASR	and i had just got up
MSU02a_50.643_3.0.wav_ASR	and um i had a cup of coffee
MSU02a_53.98_0.56.wav_ASR	and i said
MSU02a_55.031_1.86.wav_ASR	something is wrong with my arm
MSU02a_57.614_2.18.wav_ASR	uh i really didn't know i had the stroke
MSU02a_59.949_2.0.wav_ASR	uh i sa something was wrong with my
MSU02a_61.97_2.96.wav_ASR	am it's like um s pins and nails
MSU02a_65.516_4.981.wav_ASR	so um i said maybe i should take a shower and it's better alright
MSU02a_70.551_2.69.wav_ASR	and i had uh i live up stars from my mother
MSU02a_73.678_1.09.wav_ASR	and i went to my
MSU02a_75.305_1.33.wav_ASR	something is wrong with my
MSU02a_76.658_0.34.wav_ASR	am i s
MSU02a_77.446_2.66.wav_ASR	maybe i have to go to the doctor or something
MSU02a_80.377_1.81.wav_ASR	so i called my doctor
MSU02a_82.551_4.64.wav_ASR	and uh that point i was not talking as good
MSU02a_87.659_4.23.wav_ASR	and and i hung up with my doctor because i c she couldn't get on the phone
MSU02a_92.286_1.38.wav_ASR	so i hung up my doctor
MSU02a_93.731_1.4.wav_ASR	and my sister lives out there
MSU02a_95.416_0.4.wav_ASR	and i see
MSU02a_96.544_1.83.wav_ASR	you better take me to the household
MSU02a_98.965_1.55.wav_ASR	some thing is wrong with my arm
MSU02a_100.924_7.48.wav_ASR	and by the time she took me to the um um by the time she took me to the household
MSU02a_108.856_1.62.wav_ASR	and the rest of the project
MSU02a_110.565_1.91.wav_ASR	ah got to hack and sack right away
MSU02a_112.852_3.26.wav_ASR	um i think i had the stroke
MSU02a_123.733_4.639.wav_ASR	um the first thing i did was go to celsius
MSU02a_128.638_2.54.wav_ASR	ah had w i was in the household for a week
MSU02a_131.907_5.81.wav_ASR	and um i remember the thing when i was in the household i couldn't talk
MSU02a_138.154_1.77.wav_ASR	and i said only thing i th
MSU02a_140.135_1.02.wav_ASR	two and a two
MSU02a_141.455_3.21.wav_ASR	and uh a friend came to visit me at night
MSU02a_145.253_5.76.wav_ASR	and and i was i was i was um standing around
MSU02a_151.366_4.42.wav_ASR	and and i was t telling him i couldn't tell
MSU02a_155.806_0.33.wav_ASR	let's say
MSU02a_156.33_0.73.wav_ASR	too too too too
MSU02a_157.657_1.92.wav_ASR	and finally i raised up my arm
MSU02a_160.1_0.87.wav_ASR	ah can't talk
MSU02a_161.035_3.83.wav_ASR	that was the first thing uh the first thing i said to somebody
MSU02a_164.93_2.23.wav_ASR	it's it was like a windows they're a third
MSU02a_167.761_7.16.wav_ASR	and when i got home um right away i knew a speech transmitter
MSU02a_175.714_5.37.wav_ASR	and um right away i started with speech theory before i went to christmas
MSU02a_181.526_3.49.wav_ASR	and i was in christmas uh one week before um
MSU02a_185.36_9.53.wav_ASR	when i got to the household um when i had got home from the household i was in one week before i went to christmas
MSU02a_195.305_4.99.wav_ASR	and she would come over like two times for me speech therapy
MSU02a_200.605_8.65.wav_ASR	and i had um my friends everybody would cards with me th so i could speak better
MSU02a_209.651_1.44.wav_ASR	and i went into calculator
MSU02a_211.142_6.83.wav_ASR	and um they help me to be better i think
MSU02a_218.666_0.39.wav_ASR	oh
MSU02a_219.114_1.21.wav_ASR	oh no
MSU02a_228.863_0.86.wav_ASR	oh i don't like it
MSU02a_232.0_4.72.wav_ASR	oh no i am a talk
MSU02a_236.74_3.71.wav_ASR	and and and daniel daniel
MSU02a_241.038_0.84.wav_ASR	oh my god
MSU02a_254.571_2.359.wav_ASR	um i don't have any
MSU02a_257.7_1.819.wav_ASR	one of the Happiest things of my life
MSU02a_259.94_1.731.wav_ASR	uh i don't have any children
MSU02a_261.998_3.54.wav_ASR	and um my sister doesn't have any children
MSU02a_265.858_6.68.wav_ASR	and i had um my greatest thing was uh a godchild for
MSU02a_273.336_1.84.wav_ASR	that was the perfect thing for
MSU02a_276.24_1.13.wav_ASR	ah i love her
MSU02a_281.31_7.54.wav_ASR	um she is um she is um a s uh sender in colour
MSU02a_289.24_6.71.wav_ASR	and she wants to be um a physi um not a physical therapy uh automatical parameters
MSU02a_296.365_5.22.wav_ASR	so i said if i had the stroke and she was occupational therapy i would go to her
MSU02a_301.811_1.72.wav_ASR	but i think on better now
MSU02a_342.828_5.08.wav_ASR	um the boo um the boy was um kicking a soccer ball
MSU02a_348.299_3.67.wav_ASR	and the soccer ball went into his neighbour's window
MSU02a_352.388_10.89.wav_ASR	and um he was the neighbour was shot when he was um he was shocked that the ball went into the living room
MSU02a_363.592_6.78.wav_ASR	and um the boy um the man was looking um who kicked the soccer ball
MSU02a_372.51_0.57.wav_ASR	it's okay
MSU02a_376.18_2.0.wav_ASR	and i know you're not gonna tell me but
MSU02a_392.46_10.41.wav_ASR	um oh um the boy was going to school
MSU02a_402.978_1.02.wav_ASR	and his mother said
MSU02a_404.421_4.06.wav_ASR	you better bring an animal because um in my name
MSU02a_408.549_3.2.wav_ASR	and and the b the boy said to his mother
MSU02a_412.108_1.36.wav_ASR	ah i don't need an apple uh
MSU02a_414.681_1.26.wav_ASR	because he's a wolf at
MSU02a_415.964_1.0.wav_ASR	doesn't happen in real
MSU02a_417.371_2.01.wav_ASR	and he want to scroll
MSU02a_419.405_1.49.wav_ASR	well and it's started to range
MSU02a_421.271_2.9.wav_ASR	and he was getting uh drained with the rain
MSU02a_424.496_1.48.wav_ASR	and his mother says
MSU02a_426.478_1.86.wav_ASR	uh you better take an elephant now
MSU02a_428.404_0.63.wav_ASR	it came home
MSU02a_429.355_1.05.wav_ASR	and uh he's
MSU02a_430.614_1.58.wav_ASR	you better take an apple now
MSU02a_432.488_4.65.wav_ASR	and um uh and he went to school with the implementer
MSU02a_454.059_7.1.wav_ASR	um um oh but i don't understand this one
MSU02a_461.459_4.5.wav_ASR	alright well wha i c i beginning a mile and a end
MSU02a_466.275_5.72.wav_ASR	um the b um the globe lost their cat
MSU02a_472.305_1.08.wav_ASR	but up in a tree
MSU02a_474.081_6.55.wav_ASR	and his father or was some man went to get the cat from the tray
MSU02a_480.742_2.81.wav_ASR	and he got he couldn't get down
MSU02a_484.241_7.44.wav_ASR	so um so the fire truck had to come and rescue the man and rescue the cat
MSU02a_493.822_1.63.wav_ASR	and i didn't mention the dog but i don't know
MSU02a_582.049_4.03.wav_ASR	the name of the book is centredal
MSU02a_586.227_7.81.wav_ASR	and um um the scenario is um the folder of somebody who the
MSU02a_594.721_1.23.wav_ASR	yeah
MSU02a_596.594_9.19.wav_ASR	send the r. uh she was the doctor of um somebody who is going to get married
MSU02a_605.801_0.93.wav_ASR	the the ha
MSU02a_610.21_5.17.wav_ASR	she's the doctor um uh a person who
MSU02a_615.428_4.21.wav_ASR	but her father wanted to get married okay
MSU02a_620.14_3.42.wav_ASR	and sender is the the um his the doctor
MSU02a_623.963_5.23.wav_ASR	and he was going to marry um a s um a m uh stepmother
MSU02a_629.585_6.65.wav_ASR	and the stepmother had two sisters two um doors
MSU02a_636.791_3.04.wav_ASR	and um they got married
MSU02a_640.058_9.78.wav_ASR	and sender uh was the stepmother was very um not nice to sender uh
MSU02a_650.502_5.96.wav_ASR	so um the they sh send email had a script and do everything
MSU02a_656.484_9.57.wav_ASR	and to do the the um uh the um do the um hope work and everything and
MSU02a_666.071_2.01.wav_ASR	and a ball came about
MSU02a_668.493_6.77.wav_ASR	and the s the s the buttons of the the drawers of the the folders of the the m
MSU02a_675.638_7.35.wav_ASR	and sender uh couldn't go because um the stepmother said she couldn't go
MSU02a_683.318_8.31.wav_ASR	so um uh all of a sudden a friendly godmother came in and um said to send the real
MSU02a_691.908_10.64.wav_ASR	and it was a p a beautiful um uh a bundle that she had and a beautiful um uh a carry that she had
MSU02a_703.078_1.84.wav_ASR	and she went to the ball
MSU02a_705.22_3.63.wav_ASR	and um she met up the print charging
MSU02a_709.288_4.85.wav_ASR	and um but it would at twelve and a half she had to be home
MSU02a_714.533_2.94.wav_ASR	and she lost the glass liber on our way home
MSU02a_717.834_16.39.wav_ASR	and um the um uh the print time went to all the town to see what um to see um oh who could fit the glass liber
MSU02a_734.506_2.63.wav_ASR	and standard uh was there
MSU02a_738.413_0.85.wav_ASR	um done with that
MSU02a_739.502_1.4.wav_ASR	um down with that
MSU02a_740.924_0.72.wav_ASR	oh my god
MSU02a_742.527_2.65.wav_ASR	oh a g
MSU02a_745.822_1.76.wav_ASR	ah no signal uh
MSU02a_748.396_1.7.wav_ASR	oh my god
MSU02a_750.214_2.37.wav_ASR	you're you're going to tell me great friend
MSU02a_752.608_0.72.wav_ASR	let's see
MSU02a_753.498_1.28.wav_ASR	oh
MSU02a_755.173_1.49.wav_ASR	oh my god
MSU02a_759.135_1.07.wav_ASR	okay good
MSU02a_764.101_5.27.wav_ASR	ab i have to two two pieces of bread
MSU02a_770.144_2.1.wav_ASR	and you get the pen up button
MSU02a_773.087_1.46.wav_ASR	and you put it on the red
MSU02a_774.719_0.82.wav_ASR	that's the fourth
MSU02a_775.588_1.05.wav_ASR	and you put it on the bracket
MSU02a_776.656_3.2.wav_ASR	and and stick it together
MSU02a_779.877_1.29.wav_ASR	and you have a sale
MSU02a_783.584_1.29.wav_ASR	oh my god
MSU02a_786.256_1.19.wav_ASR	oh my god
MSU02b_15.115_5.1.wav_ASR	um uh sometimes it's okay
MSU02b_20.23_1.37.wav_ASR	and sometimes it's not
MSU02b_21.68_7.42.wav_ASR	um i think when i um if i know the people that i'm talking to it's it's okay
MSU02b_29.562_12.04.wav_ASR	um um when i get in a press situation when i have to um um i have to talk on the phone it's not too good
MSU02b_42.089_3.2.wav_ASR	so i tell people right away i had a stroke
MSU02b_53.446_4.29.wav_ASR	um um i walk up in the morning
MSU02b_58.037_4.73.wav_ASR	and um it was like seven thirty or something
MSU02b_63.18_4.51.wav_ASR	and um my m i was uh niddling
MSU02b_68.573_3.41.wav_ASR	uh b i really don't need but i was trying to do it
MSU02b_72.304_3.89.wav_ASR	and um uh my arm got numb
MSU02b_76.83_2.66.wav_ASR	and um i said something restarts
MSU02b_79.51_1.37.wav_ASR	and that's like volume and sleep
MSU02b_80.93_1.84.wav_ASR	it said something's wrong with my arm you know
MSU02b_83.156_4.03.wav_ASR	so um so i live down stars from uh live up stars
MSU02b_87.381_1.19.wav_ASR	my mother lives
MSU02b_89.04_1.36.wav_ASR	if we have a two family house
MSU02b_90.781_5.54.wav_ASR	and i live um um uh in the top floor
MSU02b_96.87_0.91.wav_ASR	that's the end of the project
MSU02b_97.8_1.0.wav_ASR	what's d what do you call that
MSU02b_98.847_0.47.wav_ASR	under
MSU02b_99.447_0.44.wav_ASR	overall
MSU02b_102.276_2.1.wav_ASR	but i live over her or under her
MSU02b_105.897_0.39.wav_ASR	yes
MSU02b_107.198_0.35.wav_ASR	yeah
MSU02b_108.192_0.96.wav_ASR	ah oh overcor
MSU02b_109.959_0.57.wav_ASR	oh
MSU02b_111.83_1.15.wav_ASR	that's a problem for me
MSU02b_114.711_4.59.wav_ASR	so um so um so i said to my mother i say
MSU02b_119.403_1.19.wav_ASR	something's wrong with my
MSU02b_121.06_0.65.wav_ASR	ah i don't know
MSU02b_122.048_0.95.wav_ASR	it's something wrong
MSU02b_123.31_3.19.wav_ASR	and by the time i took a shower i said
MSU02b_126.583_1.36.wav_ASR	maybe i have to go to the hospital
MSU02b_128.035_1.099.wav_ASR	so i took a shelter
MSU02b_129.4_1.25.wav_ASR	and my really arm
MSU02b_130.918_3.29.wav_ASR	and um and my sister leaves uh
MSU02b_134.91_0.73.wav_ASR	and i said
MSU02b_136.225_1.53.wav_ASR	uh i have to go to the hospital
MSU02b_137.8_5.12.wav_ASR	and by the time i get to the household i was not talking anymore
MSU02b_143.642_6.96.wav_ASR	but um my hand was um um paralyzed uh little bit
MSU02b_151.034_1.67.wav_ASR	and these three fingers
MSU02b_152.9_3.09.wav_ASR	and um and i couldn't talk anymore
MSU02b_156.046_3.59.wav_ASR	and and i don't know what they did because um
MSU02b_160.6_5.82.wav_ASR	and know that they um th maybe to bleed um for bleeding
MSU02b_167.009_1.47.wav_ASR	that i didn't have that period
MSU02b_168.531_2.04.wav_ASR	uh i d i had um a clock
MSU02b_171.21_3.25.wav_ASR	and i was i got to hack and back cost
MSU02b_175.064_8.47.wav_ASR	and um uh um they set me to mount ninja because i had an anxiety
MSU02b_184.127_4.15.wav_ASR	and my doctor is out at m mount sine
MSU02b_188.292_2.45.wav_ASR	oh they dropped me too montino
MSU02b_190.789_4.6.wav_ASR	and i was in the ten percent curve uh a couple of days
MSU02b_196.738_0.86.wav_ASR	do you want to n
MSU02b_198.693_0.69.wav_ASR	it's okay
MSU02b_207.675_4.16.wav_ASR	um i was in the household for one week
MSU02b_212.128_3.23.wav_ASR	and that next week i was home
MSU02b_215.724_4.5.wav_ASR	um but i have had friends that came over
MSU02b_220.246_3.59.wav_ASR	and they d they need i have a problem with the speaking
MSU02b_224.293_4.2.wav_ASR	and they write away try to help with speaking
MSU02b_228.877_9.82.wav_ASR	um the little card that you get for for kids you know that the a. is for apple and whatever and all all the time do that for one week
MSU02b_239.05_4.78.wav_ASR	and then i went to um um celsius
MSU02b_244.327_4.25.wav_ASR	and um i started with with speech theory
MSU02b_248.774_2.99.wav_ASR	and i started with academic television
MSU02b_252.311_13.37.wav_ASR	and um i was there from germany until um uh um six month um june
MSU02b_266.095_2.2.wav_ASR	and i was there until june
MSU02b_268.649_2.44.wav_ASR	and then i was very frustrated
MSU02b_271.109_1.53.wav_ASR	uh i started writing here
MSU02b_273.138_1.02.wav_ASR	um for monitor
MSU02b_274.924_4.0.wav_ASR	uh we didn't have to wait 'cause somebody had um didn't come
MSU02b_279.049_2.6.wav_ASR	and i filled the a sp
MSU02b_281.788_1.43.wav_ASR	so i didn't have to wait
MSU02b_283.589_0.71.wav_ASR	so it was good
MSU02b_314.213_3.96.wav_ASR	uh i w i was uh very honest to be uh a god moment
MSU02b_318.193_2.8.wav_ASR	or i don't have any um children in my home
MSU02b_321.013_1.62.wav_ASR	um my sister doesn't have any children
MSU02b_322.65_5.06.wav_ASR	so i was i was very angry to be um a godmother
MSU02b_328.044_1.48.wav_ASR	and she's stopped at that
MSU02b_329.755_1.23.wav_ASR	it's it's okay
MSU02b_355.711_4.78.wav_ASR	um um the boy is kicking a soccer ball
MSU02b_360.827_4.59.wav_ASR	and it goes into um the w uh the neighbourhood window
MSU02b_365.855_8.3.wav_ASR	and um uh he go the the name um sees the soccer ball going into his living room
MSU02b_374.46_5.58.wav_ASR	and he looks and um and sees who uh kicked the soccer ball
MSU02b_380.259_1.17.wav_ASR	but he doesn't find out
MSU02b_402.414_6.03.wav_ASR	um um the b um the little boy is telling his mother
MSU02b_408.583_3.26.wav_ASR	it don't need an album uh to go to school i think
MSU02b_412.292_1.6.wav_ASR	and um the matter said
MSU02b_414.027_1.25.wav_ASR	you have to take an angle
MSU02b_415.678_2.76.wav_ASR	but the the um boys said
MSU02b_418.865_2.84.wav_ASR	uh i don't want uh an amplifier
MSU02b_422.04_1.46.wav_ASR	and he goes to school
MSU02b_423.517_1.25.wav_ASR	and it starts to rain
MSU02b_424.786_2.46.wav_ASR	and a big range store
MSU02b_427.355_1.48.wav_ASR	and the mother comes
MSU02b_429.035_4.2.wav_ASR	um and the boy goes back to the mother and says
MSU02b_434.17_7.48.wav_ASR	you should have um um i should have listened to you
MSU02b_442.018_6.53.wav_ASR	and um and he um goes back for um the emulator
MSU02b_467.539_6.92.wav_ASR	um um um the b uh the girl lost her cat
MSU02b_474.94_5.85.wav_ASR	and um maybe his father wanted to get the cat um for her
MSU02b_481.428_1.57.wav_ASR	ah but he got in the three
MSU02b_483.051_8.31.wav_ASR	and um he he couldn't get further um further to get the cat
MSU02b_491.782_2.46.wav_ASR	so the they had to call the filename
MSU02b_494.288_9.28.wav_ASR	and the fibre man um the fibre man had to go to get the cat and replace the man i guess
MSU02b_589.06_12.78.wav_ASR	um there was um uh there was um a girl named nancy
MSU02b_602.256_5.65.wav_ASR	and her uh his uh father was getting remarried
MSU02b_608.558_10.76.wav_ASR	and um when she got r he got remarred there uh two s he's had two step steps two step drawers
MSU02b_620.174_6.44.wav_ASR	and um the the step is there in like scenario
MSU02b_626.962_13.49.wav_ASR	and she made him she um they made him they made her um do all of the um the uh house work
MSU02b_643.434_3.73.wav_ASR	and um finally a b ball came around
MSU02b_647.62_4.78.wav_ASR	and all the the step downers were going to the ball
MSU02b_652.744_3.27.wav_ASR	and centre radius couldn't go because she had too much to do
MSU02b_656.402_8.18.wav_ASR	and um uh very godmother um uh a very godfather came to her and
MSU02b_665.011_1.16.wav_ASR	you could go to the ball
MSU02b_666.28_2.5.wav_ASR	and she made a beautiful dress for her
MSU02b_669.149_6.44.wav_ASR	and she made um uh a couch with um a penguin i think it was
MSU02b_676.299_2.21.wav_ASR	and then take it out the boat
MSU02b_678.816_1.46.wav_ASR	and she had beautiful time
MSU02b_680.625_2.81.wav_ASR	and it was going to be twelve and a half
MSU02b_683.457_2.43.wav_ASR	and the colour had to be home by twelve and a half
MSU02b_686.262_6.34.wav_ASR	and when she got home um um she lost the slapper
MSU02b_693.113_7.32.wav_ASR	and um the the the print um s had a beautiful time with our
MSU02b_700.825_6.52.wav_ASR	and um uh the print um wanted to find that curve
MSU02b_707.93_3.05.wav_ASR	so uh he w looked all over the town
MSU02b_711.29_2.7.wav_ASR	and th in he finally found her
MSU02b_714.38_3.07.wav_ASR	and because the slap s clip fit
MSU02b_717.999_2.14.wav_ASR	and um then they got married
MSU02b_721.277_1.61.wav_ASR	and left up happily ever after
MSU02b_731.651_2.25.wav_ASR	you have two pieces of a red
MSU02b_734.63_5.09.wav_ASR	and um um two pieces of red
MSU02b_740.032_6.15.wav_ASR	and you uh get um pinnie button
MSU02b_747.082_1.97.wav_ASR	and you have get lazy
MSU02b_749.49_1.24.wav_ASR	and stick it together
MSU02b_751.149_2.74.wav_ASR	and you have a pen up button and a yellow sample
MSU07a_18.011_0.54.wav_ASR	better
MSU07a_19.415_0.59.wav_ASR	usually
MSU07a_20.05_1.27.wav_ASR	yeah oh my god
MSU07a_21.93_3.02.wav_ASR	and i remember i can i cannot speak
MSU07a_26.0_0.75.wav_ASR	ah no
MSU07a_30.5_1.01.wav_ASR	now real and
MSU07a_34.678_1.4.wav_ASR	peelable yeah
MSU07a_37.955_7.0.wav_ASR	um i remember th um i was at like a laptop
MSU07a_45.8_0.74.wav_ASR	yeah
MSU07a_46.76_1.02.wav_ASR	and they came
MSU07a_47.8_2.74.wav_ASR	and i don't know what happened
MSU07a_50.6_1.58.wav_ASR	ah just blank
MSU07a_53.766_11.21.wav_ASR	and then absolute can uh up and um um hell capsule
MSU07a_65.08_12.93.wav_ASR	and then y um the um oh man they came to save the day
MSU07a_78.213_0.7.wav_ASR	by the
MSU07a_78.963_0.59.wav_ASR	ah i don't know
MSU07a_81.0_2.42.wav_ASR	yeah but um the building
MSU07a_83.98_8.6.wav_ASR	ah is an is an um
MSU07a_94.541_1.71.wav_ASR	ah hubble
MSU07a_96.535_0.41.wav_ASR	yeah
MSU07a_98.406_2.57.wav_ASR	and i was there for a little bit
MSU07a_101.36_0.85.wav_ASR	the time
MSU07a_103.12_0.5.wav_ASR	yeah
MSU07a_105.0_0.59.wav_ASR	yeah
MSU07a_115.076_5.09.wav_ASR	um i've been doing pretty good
MSU07a_120.621_0.49.wav_ASR	you know

202-2_2332.075_0.5.wav_ASR	oh
202-2_2346.825_7.947.wav_ASR	the seat is the seat seat is oh sorry
202-2_2354.772_6.304.wav_ASR	oh one is putting the smile and uh and
202-2_2361.415_1.2.wav_ASR	what what
202-2_2362.925_9.86.wav_ASR	but oh water is dripping and uh and flipping and and laughing
202-2_2372.985_27.35.wav_ASR	but the little um the little is uh oh little is uh um the and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh
202-2_2403.045_7.97.wav_ASR	but one more one more i think one month
202-2_2412.315_4.51.wav_ASR	and uh i'm one month i'm laughing the
202-2_2417.585_2.25.wav_ASR	and and that
71-1_11.65_2.76.wav_ASR	um my goodness
71-1_14.65_0.62.wav_ASR	oh
71-1_16.35_1.349.wav_ASR	should be the one to bring up
71-1_17.699_11.7.wav_ASR	um you know i can just talk about the year that well nine months really when i was living in copa again when i was living in copa and then i was living in copa again
71-1_29.979_4.84.wav_ASR	um i did a test
71-1_38.11_8.87.wav_ASR	okay in my generation you could actually go for two milliseconds which is what i did which is why it is nine months
71-1_47.68_7.67.wav_ASR	um uh what i did when i got to copy hagen we had this um arrangement which you could take classes at the university
71-1_56.18_2.36.wav_ASR	um for the first semester i took
71-1_59.16_2.453.wav_ASR	we had uh classes for four days of the
71-1_61.8_1.661.wav_ASR	the three days of the week we could trouble
71-1_64.1_7.4.wav_ASR	the second sensor um because i met this one who became my best friend and it was her idea uh she said
71-1_71.94_4.16.wav_ASR	oh we can we are our education is really holding us back
71-1_76.94_18.32.wav_ASR	um so i think what we should do is we should re we should we should on the entire from the university take the time in the first week
71-1_95.93_13.06.wav_ASR	so uh i would say for those four months in which i actually had a document
71-1_110.29_3.419.wav_ASR	um remotes is far south as we go
71-1_113.771_4.08.wav_ASR	it's a r. a. um spongy
71-1_119.131_2.676.wav_ASR	um we spent a few more than a time travelling all over
71-1_121.911_2.231.wav_ASR	when you're ninety it's a really good time to travel
71-1_124.491_2.854.wav_ASR	um really good looking boys every where that you go
71-1_127.345_11.955.wav_ASR	and uh yeah i just had uh i just had the the most creative um discussion um dispute the fact that my mother said
71-1_139.525_1.2.wav_ASR	putting out a scroll
71-1_140.804_1.257.wav_ASR	oh that's terrible
71-1_142.165_0.882.wav_ASR	you will be back
71-1_143.59_1.381.wav_ASR	oh no i'll go back next
71-1_144.971_4.28.wav_ASR	oh but this is my opportunity to realise a lot
71-1_149.791_2.56.wav_ASR	oh yeah i as my friend mael said to me
71-1_153.351_1.62.wav_ASR	parameters are back in
71-1_155.291_0.913.wav_ASR	what are they gonna do
71-1_156.204_0.947.wav_ASR	we're in copi
71-1_157.791_1.89.wav_ASR	we're just gonna tell a lot of what we're doing
71-1_160.22_5.0.wav_ASR	so i it i could tell you other stories but they would probably be sensors
71-1_165.44_2.1.wav_ASR	so we won't gonna all the details
71-1_174.46_3.52.wav_ASR	let's say it was alien uh because i met my father
71-1_178.1_6.44.wav_ASR	um my um my father was only two generations from the innovations
71-1_184.94_5.88.wav_ASR	there in um round stone which is in the western country of gaul
71-1_191.32_5.02.wav_ASR	and so i c actually meet with uh other customers second customers
71-1_196.572_2.608.wav_ASR	that's for what the exact relationship is
71-1_199.432_1.95.wav_ASR	and i met people that were part of my family
71-1_201.692_7.006.wav_ASR	and i'd apples or second or third countries that looked exactly like my fingers
71-1_209.352_4.804.wav_ASR	oh yeah that was the one on standing i think yeah
71-1_236.89_0.84.wav_ASR	it comes and goes
71-1_238.25_4.65.wav_ASR	um i would say that the main problem with my language is that it's unrelated
71-1_243.73_5.13.wav_ASR	um i said a few minutes ago i was talking about going up
71-1_249.84_4.21.wav_ASR	and what interesting is that it's the walls that i have issues with
71-1_254.46_2.14.wav_ASR	oh no could not say a bro
71-1_257.12_1.089.wav_ASR	think i said a bro
71-1_258.58_0.629.wav_ASR	then i said
71-1_259.68_6.89.wav_ASR	oh i was really thinking in my brain how to walk around that or figure that out or s um feel that out on my own
71-1_267.01_2.96.wav_ASR	and um i continue our discussion with
71-1_270.27_1.84.wav_ASR	uh didn't anticipate that
71-1_272.61_2.16.wav_ASR	better than i why
71-1_275.11_5.22.wav_ASR	um i still have difficulty with complicated components
71-1_281.15_1.54.wav_ASR	um i'd still oh
71-1_282.906_4.581.wav_ASR	uh no that i have an always been confusing to other people
71-1_287.466_3.295.wav_ASR	and i do remember back what it was like when i was pitching before the s
71-1_291.106_1.62.wav_ASR	people would look poor
71-1_293.566_0.577.wav_ASR	and it was
71-1_294.446_0.82.wav_ASR	that's their problem
71-1_295.586_5.857.wav_ASR	one they look proud um a lot of times i'm pretty sure it's because i said something that didn't make any sense
71-1_301.443_11.647.wav_ASR	so i'm still trying to work on explaining complicated things to people um and trying to correct myself when i make a mistake about the other
71-1_313.523_6.04.wav_ASR	and i do continue mis mispe um on a regular basis
71-1_319.736_1.86.wav_ASR	so it's frustration
71-1_321.916_8.864.wav_ASR	but um i keep practicing it to the point that many people don't think i have a phase uh until they do not notice that i have a phase
71-1_331.276_5.44.wav_ASR	so i can communicate but not well and not the way that i used to be able to communicate
71-1_347.09_0.959.wav_ASR	oh very much
71-1_348.131_1.199.wav_ASR	yeah
71-1_350.191_0.82.wav_ASR	ah
71-1_357.66_4.863.wav_ASR	um well i didn't know that it was a stroke which is very typical
71-1_363.04_1.71.wav_ASR	ah but
71-1_364.78_1.964.wav_ASR	so how would i know what a stroke wise
71-1_366.88_4.114.wav_ASR	it was uh adaptable um uh working out
71-1_371.1_1.984.wav_ASR	it was anyway
71-1_373.42_4.0.wav_ASR	think about that was a day when i you know that's the day when the revolution stops
71-1_377.8_1.688.wav_ASR	oh i'm not uh to get out of there
71-1_379.52_2.533.wav_ASR	and needs to start working out again rather than a band
71-1_382.16_0.893.wav_ASR	and i was add it
71-1_384.16_2.555.wav_ASR	and i work the hell out man
71-1_386.84_1.385.wav_ASR	and i think i did ate my
71-1_388.82_3.88.wav_ASR	my part rate is up to like a hundred and seven
71-1_393.18_0.64.wav_ASR	okay
71-1_394.24_0.819.wav_ASR	and we keep this on
71-1_395.34_2.9.wav_ASR	uh i d i i wasn't time
71-1_398.62_0.92.wav_ASR	that isn't feedback
71-1_400.16_11.482.wav_ASR	uh got off the electric and had double vision and then divided i would walk for two more miles um mostly because the black panther was on
71-1_412.0_1.26.wav_ASR	oh
71-1_413.3_0.677.wav_ASR	but that was on
71-1_413.977_4.84.wav_ASR	and i thought i wanted to watch it because really like oh um chat with
71-1_419.837_1.766.wav_ASR	oh
71-1_422.137_2.144.wav_ASR	the uh again i had double vision
71-1_425.157_2.023.wav_ASR	oh i just didn't feel bad anymore
71-1_427.66_7.131.wav_ASR	um went home and had a thunder clap um on my right side
71-1_434.94_0.52.wav_ASR	and just say
71-1_435.94_1.381.wav_ASR	um no idea what that
71-1_437.76_2.145.wav_ASR	um so i could ignore it
71-1_440.66_2.93.wav_ASR	the the next day i couldn't work it on
71-1_443.78_1.7.wav_ASR	it's trying to write a conference report
71-1_445.86_0.64.wav_ASR	nothing would
71-1_446.77_1.3.wav_ASR	and i couldn't do
71-1_449.31_3.735.wav_ASR	so um i want to get my head my head cut the next day
71-1_453.11_3.247.wav_ASR	and i wanted to cancel um because i had a really bad headache
71-1_456.67_2.13.wav_ASR	but um if you cancel it you had to pay for
71-1_459.29_1.889.wav_ASR	and my hair will be cut
71-1_461.93_0.942.wav_ASR	oh i c
71-1_462.93_1.662.wav_ASR	um i live alone
71-1_464.592_2.463.wav_ASR	so i hadn't really talked to anybody in two days
71-1_467.512_1.658.wav_ASR	oh
71-1_469.572_2.734.wav_ASR	and i couldn't tell her how i wanted it to get my hair cut
71-1_473.192_2.18.wav_ASR	ah it was i couldn't say
71-1_476.352_4.42.wav_ASR	um so i couldn't tell or that i'd been warning sw
71-1_481.512_1.76.wav_ASR	oh i couldn't i don't know what was coming
71-1_483.692_0.608.wav_ASR	that was two
71-1_484.66_2.06.wav_ASR	and she's like nothing it's smiling
71-1_486.78_1.691.wav_ASR	it's you had no idea what i was talking
71-1_489.8_0.46.wav_ASR	oh i see
71-1_490.62_1.01.wav_ASR	oh something's wrong
71-1_492.54_1.8.wav_ASR	so i told her
71-1_494.62_0.3.wav_ASR	it's a
71-1_495.129_0.678.wav_ASR	like your head
71-1_497.02_2.56.wav_ASR	so sh actually she didn't have his hair
71-1_499.94_1.89.wav_ASR	should cut her hair the way i
71-1_502.08_0.3.wav_ASR	nei
71-1_502.46_3.93.wav_ASR	and you know better go call a doctor because this doesn't make any sense
71-1_507.5_2.1.wav_ASR	so i i'd i'd try i
71-1_510.16_4.24.wav_ASR	and i think this is something that must happen with people that have strokes is that they
71-1_516.46_3.62.wav_ASR	it looked up the number that i was supposed to call orange kinetic
71-1_520.22_1.589.wav_ASR	this was already six
71-1_522.35_2.64.wav_ASR	and it had all these
71-1_526.21_3.46.wav_ASR	if it's an immediate argument you go call
71-1_530.13_0.33.wav_ASR	oh my god
71-1_530.61_0.757.wav_ASR	that
71-1_531.59_3.737.wav_ASR	um i'm just going to go into the current climate tomorrow morning
71-1_536.11_0.706.wav_ASR	um and then it's a
71-1_537.11_3.2.wav_ASR	if it's this situation call um
71-1_540.703_4.014.wav_ASR	and if it's this situation call you know press three
71-1_545.023_2.16.wav_ASR	if it's this situation
71-1_548.083_3.82.wav_ASR	apparently if you stay on for two and a half minutes they'd finally say
71-1_552.343_1.811.wav_ASR	real person will come on the line
71-1_555.283_1.601.wav_ASR	uh my head really hurt
71-1_557.243_0.593.wav_ASR	let's just go
71-1_557.903_1.16.wav_ASR	but this is
71-1_559.46_2.24.wav_ASR	so i come up the phone and say
71-1_561.9_1.13.wav_ASR	just get up tomorrow
71-1_563.38_2.36.wav_ASR	uh i'll see if i anybody will answer the phone
71-1_566.68_1.06.wav_ASR	um
71-1_568.34_4.12.wav_ASR	and she she was very friendly
71-1_573.0_0.6.wav_ASR	two is that
71-1_573.7_1.12.wav_ASR	it don't sound like yourself
71-1_576.13_1.22.wav_ASR	you need to go take an ant
71-1_577.9_1.29.wav_ASR	oh that can be a pain for an animal
71-1_579.24_0.78.wav_ASR	that's right
71-1_580.52_1.22.wav_ASR	um
71-1_581.84_0.82.wav_ASR	it just have a head
71-1_582.9_2.28.wav_ASR	uh i don't want i don't want to spend that much money
71-1_586.02_6.16.wav_ASR	and she and her uh partner uh they called the fire department
71-1_592.48_0.8.wav_ASR	it's an animal
71-1_593.56_2.263.wav_ASR	she's just um finishing up there
71-1_596.04_2.585.wav_ASR	it's she um they call the fire department in master
71-1_598.625_1.419.wav_ASR	and and they say
71-1_601.165_2.74.wav_ASR	fatally this is
71-1_604.725_1.16.wav_ASR	this is for
71-1_606.385_0.335.wav_ASR	and they s
71-1_607.54_1.23.wav_ASR	it sounds like she's having a s
71-1_609.285_2.315.wav_ASR	you needs to get to the h um organization
71-1_613.76_1.04.wav_ASR	and and they say
71-1_614.845_1.205.wav_ASR	but she doesn't wanna go
71-1_616.36_0.52.wav_ASR	and they said
71-1_616.96_5.542.wav_ASR	oh that i know is i'm living on my you know uh it getting ready to take up
71-1_623.14_4.643.wav_ASR	and i hear the people running up the stairs outside my my apartment
71-1_628.28_4.927.wav_ASR	um just um these really good looking fireman by the way
71-1_633.62_2.12.wav_ASR	it i think it must be the universal
71-1_636.04_0.645.wav_ASR	oh that's true
71-1_637.365_1.928.wav_ASR	ah i answered the door
71-1_639.285_1.265.wav_ASR	and i told them that
71-1_640.825_1.38.wav_ASR	oh i didn't have
71-1_642.545_1.252.wav_ASR	it didn't know what was going on
71-1_644.165_1.173.wav_ASR	um i couldn't talk
71-1_646.805_1.205.wav_ASR	you need to come with us right now
71-1_648.285_0.355.wav_ASR	nee
71-1_648.745_0.913.wav_ASR	well no i'll take that
71-1_650.705_0.335.wav_ASR	and they say
71-1_651.417_0.908.wav_ASR	you can't drive
71-1_653.105_1.585.wav_ASR	oh i'm gonna go tomorrow to the
71-1_654.885_1.437.wav_ASR	oh you're gonna go to this right now
71-1_656.32_0.62.wav_ASR	oh let's see
71-1_657.32_0.817.wav_ASR	al alright
71-1_658.28_2.28.wav_ASR	oh let me get my coat and all the other
71-1_660.88_3.715.wav_ASR	it all the sudden i got into the emergency room
71-1_664.74_1.961.wav_ASR	it was just this huge um
71-1_667.8_1.86.wav_ASR	it's basi around and yellow
71-1_670.22_6.1.wav_ASR	um um all the sudden uh they held me in for a a cat stand and came out and say
71-1_676.5_1.02.wav_ASR	yeah you had a strip
71-1_678.32_2.727.wav_ASR	so i ask the doctor
71-1_681.06_3.681.wav_ASR	and he showed me on the cat stand exactly what it had
71-1_685.44_3.23.wav_ASR	um uh they added it
71-1_689.38_2.962.wav_ASR	um so that's i had a strip
71-1_692.75_6.56.wav_ASR	yeah i'd i'd i'd i'd had no issues what so ever with mice mouse feet
71-1_699.81_1.65.wav_ASR	bottoms
71-1_702.78_2.04.wav_ASR	um i just didn't know about the header
71-1_705.03_0.95.wav_ASR	and never had one again
71-1_706.88_1.18.wav_ASR	and never had
71-1_708.53_7.93.wav_ASR	but apparently if you get a really bad headache that hits you on the side of the head it means you should probably go to the emergency room
71-1_717.45_2.54.wav_ASR	oh i don't know if that gave you uh
71-1_720.582_1.363.wav_ASR	it doesn't give you a lot of insight
71-1_722.34_8.435.wav_ASR	again in my d completely um right after i had worked out one i had the edit it
71-1_731.3_3.77.wav_ASR	and the the window of opportunity had to
71-1_737.18_5.617.wav_ASR	uh but it isn't a s a schematic it is an schematic stroke not a electromagnetic stroke
71-1_743.84_6.846.wav_ASR	and uh they ultimately decided it was printable because they'd be not able to find out why i had it
71-1_751.22_7.24.wav_ASR	um i d all of my numbers are s mathematical numbers are good
71-1_758.94_0.8.wav_ASR	now
71-1_760.32_0.82.wav_ASR	ah i don't smile
71-1_762.02_1.88.wav_ASR	um i have a low blood pressure
71-1_764.42_2.25.wav_ASR	um everything looks
71-1_767.76_1.39.wav_ASR	but i did indeed have a strip
71-1_769.54_2.64.wav_ASR	so something happens somewhere
71-1_772.78_3.16.wav_ASR	um and in the hall i got to watch the intro
71-1_776.46_0.954.wav_ASR	and it is
71-1_780.18_0.96.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
71-1_781.58_4.48.wav_ASR	yeah so yeah so two years two years later here
71-1_797.2_17.56.wav_ASR	well again i in if i ever get to the point that i'm automatical about this i'm going to use my practicality um activity and and reusing um do something more about getting people some kind of triangle
71-1_814.772_2.553.wav_ASR	it um i was given an almost nothing
71-1_817.552_3.086.wav_ASR	particularly i think it was because uh
71-1_820.772_2.485.wav_ASR	uh it really massiveness is a major city
71-1_823.472_6.42.wav_ASR	so i should have to be able to get the best type of um uh help uh
71-1_830.372_0.477.wav_ASR	uh i did
71-1_830.849_4.78.wav_ASR	um the best i could get was we found two speech stereo
71-1_836.569_2.232.wav_ASR	one of them only specialised in children
71-1_839.189_1.351.wav_ASR	so i didn't work with
71-1_840.909_0.92.wav_ASR	the other person
71-1_842.229_4.18.wav_ASR	it is literally one hour a week
71-1_847.59_16.523.wav_ASR	and um basically uh because i am an academic because i have that part of my brain isn't um um uh infra red failed with an anyway i had my own research
71-1_864.29_2.08.wav_ASR	had to do a lot of research
71-1_866.55_4.28.wav_ASR	and uh the the speech's philosophy is it
71-1_871.09_0.612.wav_ASR	it's difficult
71-1_872.39_3.118.wav_ASR	should she i mean should me a lot i would say
71-1_875.61_2.902.wav_ASR	so i should be looking up on this particular thing
71-1_878.63_2.25.wav_ASR	and i should be looking um
71-1_881.53_3.02.wav_ASR	and but she hasn't caught up with it either
71-1_884.71_4.16.wav_ASR	she hadn't learned about some of the most recent trends that were available
71-1_889.53_7.52.wav_ASR	so basically what i did is um i'm i went back to exercise as soon as they allowed me
71-1_897.35_2.7.wav_ASR	it couldn't work out for three month
71-1_900.34_5.67.wav_ASR	it could only walk because they were concerned that my physical ability had something to do with the str
71-1_906.42_0.66.wav_ASR	ch
71-1_909.64_1.189.wav_ASR	oh i just had to walk
71-1_911.14_1.081.wav_ASR	um i had that
71-1_913.2_1.401.wav_ASR	tested me for a. v.
71-1_914.74_3.28.wav_ASR	and i had to work this for another month
71-1_918.17_2.86.wav_ASR	but i don't have a thumb either so
71-1_921.33_2.315.wav_ASR	um but i focus on design
71-1_924.37_4.82.wav_ASR	um um i really wasn't drawing much outline at all then anyway
71-1_930.27_1.38.wav_ASR	uh i stop it complete
71-1_932.87_2.66.wav_ASR	um so now i'm back exercising and as much as i can
71-1_935.83_2.18.wav_ASR	um really careful in terms of my dies
71-1_938.49_7.52.wav_ASR	um and i really uh focus on implementation uh limiting it in terms of my design and what i
71-1_947.57_2.29.wav_ASR	and i write every day
71-1_950.51_1.38.wav_ASR	uh i'm a journal every day
71-1_951.89_3.934.wav_ASR	now i'm trying to write an article um which i hope to get published
71-1_955.824_20.3.wav_ASR	uh because that's maybe the hardest thing for my brain that i've ever had to do before the scroll or after is the uh ability to weigh in and um really um design of of argument
71-1_976.405_1.819.wav_ASR	um so four and a half
71-1_978.345_9.56.wav_ASR	um i read aloud everybody uh the news papers because i think s words is a way of re starting those
71-1_988.605_2.865.wav_ASR	uh whether it's the files that were
71-1_991.665_2.454.wav_ASR	it just need to learn how to say a word
71-1_994.405_0.82.wav_ASR	the
71-1_995.479_4.388.wav_ASR	uh i'll probably be able to say that a lot for a long time until it's a week
71-1_999.919_4.279.wav_ASR	then i'll miss miss uh pronounce that one again
71-1_1005.119_5.531.wav_ASR	um that's really all i know how to do is keeping it up in terms of
71-1_1011.439_0.611.wav_ASR	and sleeping
71-1_1012.379_2.191.wav_ASR	um i'm always happy
71-1_1014.87_2.86.wav_ASR	uh generally i have gone with out it
71-1_1018.68_1.81.wav_ASR	um you know if you stay late you're doing some
71-1_1020.89_3.12.wav_ASR	you still have to get up because you have to click it or you've got stuff to do
71-1_1024.67_8.638.wav_ASR	uh try to make sure i always have at least eight or nine hours a week um uh hours a day to sleep
71-1_1033.308_3.68.wav_ASR	but and that seems to be something that i didn't need to do before
71-1_1037.181_1.688.wav_ASR	now i really do need to do
71-1_1038.968_2.762.wav_ASR	but that's on
71-1_1042.028_0.872.wav_ASR	um still working
71-1_1043.248_1.404.wav_ASR	but i'm not able to reach
71-1_1045.089_3.024.wav_ASR	ah you can see what i would be like in ninety minutes
71-1_1048.268_0.89.wav_ASR	it can't front or a cl
71-1_1049.328_0.769.wav_ASR	let's start
71-1_1050.288_0.602.wav_ASR	computer will be gone
71-1_1051.388_0.52.wav_ASR	it
71-1_1052.271_0.5.wav_ASR	yeah
71-1_1054.451_1.998.wav_ASR	so it maybe that would come
71-1_1056.791_0.58.wav_ASR	and i can do
71-1_1058.051_3.74.wav_ASR	uh i could teach through online uh stuff
71-1_1062.471_2.149.wav_ASR	it um so for i'm just doing other stuff
71-1_1064.971_1.119.wav_ASR	uh i did a lot of research
71-1_1067.49_1.36.wav_ASR	we'll see if i can get back to it again
71-1_1069.371_0.419.wav_ASR	uh no
71-1_1070.87_1.35.wav_ASR	 anyway so that's what i do
71-1_1072.81_4.64.wav_ASR	um and and i think doing it consistently is really really important
71-1_1077.79_2.66.wav_ASR	and i just keep pushing myself to do different thing
71-1_1081.13_6.08.wav_ASR	um uh there's literally nothing that i'm not uh focusing myself to
71-1_1087.51_0.909.wav_ASR	oh focusing myself
71-1_1088.69_2.265.wav_ASR	it's certain things i go through every single day
71-1_1091.81_2.36.wav_ASR	um i do you logo every night
71-1_1094.51_1.1.wav_ASR	think that's useful
71-1_1096.57_1.69.wav_ASR	uh i'd i don't know
71-1_1098.26_19.94.wav_ASR	um again i'm always looking at my research always thinking about uh my brain in some way or another um to the extent that my brain will be able to pare those um language parts
71-1_1119.04_7.42.wav_ASR	and spend a few more than time trying to figure out why a right handed person with a stroke on the right side ended up with a phase
71-1_1127.38_10.66.wav_ASR	but i mean other than the fact that it doesn't qualify me for any critical triangles because
71-1_1138.248_3.801.wav_ASR	um other than that i guess i just don't worry about it all that much
71-1_1142.228_13.0.wav_ASR	and just doing what i can to try to reveal on neutral plastic to be able to take forth uh take take hold
71-1_1155.48_9.755.wav_ASR	though um i do understand that uh my age in my sixties is
71-1_1165.72_1.66.wav_ASR	so i don't know
71-1_1167.66_0.67.wav_ASR	let's see what
71-1_1168.91_6.48.wav_ASR	and just watch it every day um this experiment in work or this work in progress and see the
71-1_1175.93_2.077.wav_ASR	how it comes out and how it doesn't come out
71-1_1178.67_1.08.wav_ASR	we'll see yeah
71-1_1179.91_1.98.wav_ASR	oh a lot of people don't know i have a phase
71-1_1182.17_12.68.wav_ASR	and i like keeping it that way because the uh there is a s a sma attachment to having a disability even if it's anible
71-1_1196.42_8.392.wav_ASR	ah but we'll just think i miss um then um think that they have to speak very carefully around me
71-1_1205.08_4.784.wav_ASR	oh i i'd rather just see if i can just win it
71-1_1210.7_3.66.wav_ASR	oh yeah very few people know that i have that i have a phase
71-1_1214.592_1.416.wav_ASR	the family members no
71-1_1216.008_3.437.wav_ASR	but um i don't tell anyone else about
71-1_1219.768_1.825.wav_ASR	just try to figure it out
71-1_1242.33_1.36.wav_ASR	it should be something important
71-1_1246.83_4.6.wav_ASR	you know i w i guess i would
71-1_1251.764_12.94.wav_ASR	it's something that i would say is being very important for me
71-1_1266.024_2.112.wav_ASR	um very close to
71-1_1268.136_3.957.wav_ASR	uh i met eight and a half about ten years ago
71-1_1273.036_2.404.wav_ASR	oh but probably more fifteen years at this point
71-1_1276.336_2.78.wav_ASR	and i was teaching um at a university
71-1_1279.476_1.38.wav_ASR	and divided her to
71-1_1280.996_6.4.wav_ASR	it's the advertiser of the latest developments on state triple relation because my research is on state triple relation
71-1_1287.93_7.06.wav_ASR	and i had invited her to come and speak in uh one of my classes
71-1_1295.79_0.926.wav_ASR	and she came down
71-1_1297.17_2.48.wav_ASR	and we hit it off with each other
71-1_1300.24_3.96.wav_ASR	and she was one of the most remarkable people that i have ever
71-1_1304.73_5.19.wav_ASR	um she was the oldest in a family of a lemon
71-1_1310.55_3.42.wav_ASR	she grew up on the manual resistance without running water
71-1_1315.01_5.11.wav_ASR	he was the first person to um get a colour degree from my tri
71-1_1321.04_3.68.wav_ASR	and she became the first female triple chair
71-1_1325.92_7.08.wav_ASR	and in the last ten years i would say uh we've gone on trips together
71-1_1333.92_3.12.wav_ASR	and uh generally because as she's getting older she's under eighty
71-1_1337.32_0.87.wav_ASR	so she lets me
71-1_1339.05_7.74.wav_ASR	and we go to different ads um or different um hearings in which um she's going to offer test
71-1_1347.67_7.05.wav_ASR	what i've learned from hanging out with this one who is uh im adaptable is the word i would use
71-1_1355.21_1.06.wav_ASR	yeah
71-1_1356.984_2.503.wav_ASR	she doesn't see that well anymore
71-1_1359.704_1.4.wav_ASR	you have trouble reading anyway
71-1_1361.57_3.02.wav_ASR	but um she has me rights for
71-1_1365.124_1.586.wav_ASR	he gets up and presents
71-1_1366.71_12.02.wav_ASR	um and she refuses to to take uh she refuses to t to listen to the the response no
71-1_1379.45_3.74.wav_ASR	he will find a way to power on three
71-1_1384.07_3.535.wav_ASR	and she gets things done that other people have not done
71-1_1387.89_9.96.wav_ASR	and why i see this is important is my own m brother is very passionate and very kind of me to men
71-1_1398.43_12.315.wav_ASR	and hanging out with a. d. uh i have learned a great deal about what it means to be a powerful one that you say something
71-1_1411.09_1.635.wav_ASR	and just get up
71-1_1412.95_0.663.wav_ASR	so you're tri
71-1_1414.29_1.84.wav_ASR	and present your test model
71-1_1416.263_8.47.wav_ASR	and push every liver that you can't legally to be able to get things through that you wanna get through
71-1_1424.733_14.14.wav_ASR	so working with a. d. a. over the last couple of years we've been able to stop a mine from the manual rubber which would have been really design
71-1_1440.7_6.776.wav_ASR	so um she has been my uh inspiration in terms of what i've learned from her
71-1_1447.78_1.68.wav_ASR	yeah
71-1_1449.92_2.26.wav_ASR	oh so that's that's the other
71-1_1452.86_0.96.wav_ASR	and the yeah
71-1_1454.02_6.652.wav_ASR	he's been an on going um source of importance for me i think to model myself after
71-1_1514.123_7.78.wav_ASR	well i mean it looks like begins with um a boy who's playing with a soccer
71-1_1522.3_7.984.wav_ASR	he's on his own uh probably in his um because this is something and he's really interested in doing
71-1_1530.81_8.77.wav_ASR	and he pick the ball maybe a little bit too
71-1_1540.7_3.8.wav_ASR	and it broke into the window next door
71-1_1545.58_2.64.wav_ASR	and unfortunately um
71-1_1549.0_11.31.wav_ASR	the the ball came through the window um right next to the chair where his next door is sitting on his chair
71-1_1561.7_4.32.wav_ASR	oh he's obviously really upset about this because he could have been hurt
71-1_1566.34_1.16.wav_ASR	and the glasses are b
71-1_1568.22_1.04.wav_ASR	and it's in his yeah
71-1_1569.74_1.088.wav_ASR	it shouldn't happen
71-1_1571.64_7.02.wav_ASR	and so he grabs the chair looks out the window to find the laptop who did this to him
71-1_1578.75_3.64.wav_ASR	oh they're going to be some kind of um uh
71-1_1582.51_3.18.wav_ASR	it's gonna need some kind of repetitions that are made in the portfolio
71-1_1585.938_20.64.wav_ASR	uh he looks like he's about ready to head over grab the boy and the prompt that the name would be paid for how the window would be anyway from the windows
71-1_1623.92_0.5.wav_ASR	oh
71-1_1624.855_4.46.wav_ASR	well it looks as if this little
71-1_1630.595_1.88.wav_ASR	let's say
71-1_1632.686_1.727.wav_ASR	hard it actually it could be kind of
71-1_1635.675_3.5.wav_ASR	oh i can't decide if it's male or female
71-1_1639.515_3.031.wav_ASR	think
71-1_1643.288_9.44.wav_ASR	um they's getting ready to head out to the library somewhere
71-1_1653.76_5.85.wav_ASR	and their mother looked outside and
71-1_1660.248_1.642.wav_ASR	oh i think we're gonna see some name
71-1_1662.48_1.17.wav_ASR	you might need the animal
71-1_1664.82_1.11.wav_ASR	but this child said
71-1_1666.34_1.55.wav_ASR	you don't need an apple
71-1_1668.44_1.2.wav_ASR	and this is ridiculous
71-1_1669.94_0.6.wav_ASR	so i'm not going to
71-1_1670.78_1.68.wav_ASR	uh i don't really care about getting
71-1_1672.82_0.87.wav_ASR	you know i don't
71-1_1674.76_0.73.wav_ASR	and not like sh
71-1_1675.74_1.68.wav_ASR	it don't melt when the water hits
71-1_1678.28_1.97.wav_ASR	oh this this is
71-1_1680.78_0.88.wav_ASR	um leaving anyway
71-1_1681.66_1.72.wav_ASR	hey this is
71-1_1683.529_1.775.wav_ASR	it immediately becomes irrelevant
71-1_1686.38_1.31.wav_ASR	all the buttons
71-1_1688.02_4.78.wav_ASR	hey i'm getting i'm getting red draps in my eyes
71-1_1693.33_1.4.wav_ASR	um i'm really bad
71-1_1695.36_1.22.wav_ASR	this is not
71-1_1697.22_2.14.wav_ASR	it didn't understand that it would get in my eyes
71-1_1700.24_4.96.wav_ASR	so i immediately hated it back because it was ranking much harder than i thought it was
71-1_1706.08_0.654.wav_ASR	lot yeah
71-1_1706.84_0.896.wav_ASR	instead of my message
71-1_1708.14_1.485.wav_ASR	um i just looked at her
71-1_1710.54_2.22.wav_ASR	she of course knew that i was right
71-1_1713.18_11.1.wav_ASR	um the manner immediately understood that while it was very difficult for this child to ask for it or to acknowledge that they were wrong
71-1_1725.08_5.08.wav_ASR	um they did make clear that they did indeed need an animal if they're gonna be walking to a light
71-1_1730.64_3.56.wav_ASR	so the mother then gave them the amber
71-1_1734.68_10.14.wav_ASR	and they went back on their way with an album uh remembering at this point that maybe there's actually no but they're talking about what they're talking about
71-1_1761.65_0.5.wav_ASR	yeah
71-1_1762.547_29.94.wav_ASR	um well what um is that the cat that belongs to the little girl and the name of the hand
71-1_1800.778_0.579.wav_ASR	hello
71-1_1802.158_0.382.wav_ASR	me
71-1_1802.54_6.1.wav_ASR	and the little girl is obviously just really imposing about the situation of our c
71-1_1808.838_1.772.wav_ASR	it's very worried about getting our cat out
71-1_1811.358_5.082.wav_ASR	so she began by going to her father and
71-1_1816.78_4.1.wav_ASR	can you please help me get the cat out uh of the three
71-1_1820.94_4.437.wav_ASR	and the the and the
71-1_1825.6_0.417.wav_ASR	four is
71-1_1826.1_18.22.wav_ASR	and he grabbed his laptop and put it against the the the limb where the cat was because uh those branches are too fragile
71-1_1845.67_8.6.wav_ASR	um he also inventively kicked off the la later which then puts him back in a situation that he needs to be rescued
71-1_1855.03_5.868.wav_ASR	so at this point the dog is now backing because the dog wants the floor
71-1_1861.6_10.368.wav_ASR	the backing of the door of the dog is making it more difficult for the cat to eat it's way back down to the front
71-1_1872.9_8.052.wav_ASR	oh sorry the little girl is still really stressing because her child um her child's cat is
71-1_1880.952_2.68.wav_ASR	that that's a symmetric parabolic eraser
71-1_1883.772_0.899.wav_ASR	make that all the time
71-1_1885.192_3.057.wav_ASR	is really wants for cat to be able to get out
71-1_1888.249_17.88.wav_ASR	so they call the fibre department to come down and not just rescue the cat but also reset the three
71-1_1906.179_13.419.wav_ASR	uh but it it does absolutely shows that the better um was really trying to do in terms of helping out the um get the cat out of the tree
71-1_1939.75_0.39.wav_ASR	so
71-1_2104.158_2.744.wav_ASR	um i'll keep the temporary critique a bit
71-1_2107.478_3.16.wav_ASR	it will be next time around
71-1_2113.118_0.492.wav_ASR	but
71-1_2113.85_8.89.wav_ASR	um the c. r. l. is um she's the the
71-1_2123.66_2.76.wav_ASR	um my mother has killed has been killed
71-1_2127.23_2.66.wav_ASR	and so the two of them are
71-1_2131.04_13.9.wav_ASR	the and the his for his degree is that it would be really helpful for his daughter
71-1_2146.02_1.74.wav_ASR	so he met this
71-1_2149.12_2.03.wav_ASR	it don't know that we've ever heard her name
71-1_2151.74_3.0.wav_ASR	um but anyway th uh d otherwise no is
71-1_2155.58_6.48.wav_ASR	but made very clear that he would be that she would be a wonderful mother to sender
71-1_2162.44_1.851.wav_ASR	she also had buttons of her own
71-1_2165.48_1.34.wav_ASR	or they
71-1_2167.42_10.34.wav_ASR	and unfortunately the way that sam um the serial is destroyed is not applicable
71-1_2178.36_5.417.wav_ASR	he was not uh deleted the same way that these ten dollars were destroyed
71-1_2183.777_4.48.wav_ASR	and and instead she was used as a as a mate
71-1_2188.336_5.469.wav_ASR	and and i have no idea why for her is in this whole picture and why he's not doing anything about this
71-1_2194.037_3.593.wav_ASR	but uh maybe he's trading or he's gone or whatever
71-1_2197.83_17.72.wav_ASR	but he's left the management of his daughter to his mother who um treats her very badly um doesn't treat her the same and has given the message to her daughter
71-1_2216.67_10.5.wav_ASR	so she absolutely becomes the maid to these two steps and to a step mister and to a step mister
71-1_2228.39_5.92.wav_ASR	um but she still has she's a a very very weak one
71-1_2235.23_16.92.wav_ASR	she has found a way to um she's found a way to all have hoppiness and the ability limitations that's a mate is to um make sure that the animals are fed
71-1_2252.39_1.84.wav_ASR	so she sings too
71-1_2255.14_0.93.wav_ASR	ah they love fruit
71-1_2256.32_5.39.wav_ASR	she's close to the the the horns um the other animals um the other animals
71-1_2262.1_9.26.wav_ASR	and she dreams about uh being in a better situation where she's lucky and is treated um with more respect than she is
71-1_2271.67_11.59.wav_ASR	oh she's so quite beautiful which is certainly one of the reasons why the stepisters are so um mean to her because they are not anyway near as attractive as she
71-1_2284.39_18.53.wav_ASR	but um well this is going on in his own of the children um has made it clear to his son that's the king would like to marry
71-1_2303.08_7.52.wav_ASR	and you'd like to um hand down the uh kingdom to his uh kingdom to his own
71-1_2311.32_1.88.wav_ASR	but first his son has to marry
71-1_2313.84_2.509.wav_ASR	and um he doesn't really want
71-1_2316.62_1.587.wav_ASR	he's not interested in anyway
71-1_2318.34_1.38.wav_ASR	it's not fading anymore
71-1_2320.22_3.01.wav_ASR	but uh the plan is that this is his duty
71-1_2324.16_3.094.wav_ASR	it's kinda like the print of that time
71-1_2327.3_3.0.wav_ASR	the square and not the yellow
71-1_2331.06_5.74.wav_ASR	but in any case uh the plan is that there's gonna be a d a giant ball a date
71-1_2336.832_13.545.wav_ASR	and all of the elderly which i guess means of child bearing bearing years are supposed to show up at this dance so that he can pick the one that he wants
71-1_2350.732_4.303.wav_ASR	and again we will not get into the fundament critique of how this all work
71-1_2356.58_2.034.wav_ASR	initially uh the word gets out
71-1_2359.36_6.948.wav_ASR	the two stepsisters are just really excited about this idea because they're the right age
71-1_2366.94_9.235.wav_ASR	um because their mother had married simba's brother who makes a fair amount of money um they can dress really well
71-1_2376.175_11.163.wav_ASR	well they can they can get dropped up to go to this and uh see if they could be the one that would attract the um the attention of the print
71-1_2388.615_1.676.wav_ASR	um the centre wants to go
71-1_2390.815_3.322.wav_ASR	um she also reads about this that that is coming in
71-1_2394.137_3.18.wav_ASR	that she knows she's able because she's the right age
71-1_2397.537_6.18.wav_ASR	um i guess she's of that nationality or whatever criteria they're use
71-1_2404.5_6.33.wav_ASR	uh but her stepmother kind of makes clear that no she's she's not invited to go
71-1_2411.78_5.16.wav_ASR	um she's not gonna be able to go to stores and buy clothes the way that
71-1_2417.82_2.25.wav_ASR	um so she tries to make something on our
71-1_2420.4_3.38.wav_ASR	you try to take the materials and the legs that are replaceable
71-1_2424.24_4.62.wav_ASR	it looks uh uh looks up how to make them in a
71-1_2429.36_1.08.wav_ASR	that was on page level
71-1_2430.56_1.38.wav_ASR	think that's what
71-1_2432.61_1.33.wav_ASR	and she comes up to the desk
71-1_2434.24_1.5.wav_ASR	of course she looks amazing
71-1_2436.71_9.244.wav_ASR	it's we're pretty in pink the fill with um inkwell um she's got away with it
71-1_2446.2_1.78.wav_ASR	uh this is not
71-1_2449.65_1.12.wav_ASR	this is
71-1_2450.992_2.458.wav_ASR	so my mother loves at her and says
71-1_2453.57_1.49.wav_ASR	now going out with those clothes
71-1_2455.45_2.61.wav_ASR	and my step sisters uh morch or
71-1_2458.95_2.32.wav_ASR	and she's out in the bar by her s
71-1_2462.19_9.66.wav_ASR	and the second this um very god godmother shows up um based on one of her wishes
71-1_2472.03_2.42.wav_ASR	uh wish i could go to the ball
71-1_2475.65_12.128.wav_ASR	and she the reason that the hairy sorry favourite god is showing up is because she knows that um simba is a is a really sweet young girl
71-1_2488.53_2.041.wav_ASR	and she cares about everybody else
71-1_2490.87_1.674.wav_ASR	she does things for everybody else
71-1_2492.544_4.96.wav_ASR	and because of the purity of our part she deserves this chance
71-1_2498.584_2.36.wav_ASR	oh should use her
71-1_2502.18_6.324.wav_ASR	and she not only creates a dress for her that is um entirely or
71-1_2509.124_2.72.wav_ASR	you can go to the
71-1_2511.9_14.753.wav_ASR	um but she also transforms the mics in to uh cameras and the pump can in uh colour so that she can get there
71-1_2526.84_2.1.wav_ASR	um and she can write in style
71-1_2529.78_4.64.wav_ASR	so it's very very happy hug her
71-1_2534.78_0.88.wav_ASR	and our command is
71-1_2535.86_5.98.wav_ASR	remember this only will last this dream will only last until
71-1_2542.26_4.463.wav_ASR	at midnight your dress will go back to your rat
71-1_2546.723_5.94.wav_ASR	guess your forecasts will go back will be transferred back into
71-1_2554.163_6.318.wav_ASR	and the costs will be or the requirements will be transferred back into a pump can
71-1_2561.13_0.573.wav_ASR	and she said
71-1_2561.943_0.442.wav_ASR	so i know
71-1_2562.423_0.792.wav_ASR	thank you very much
71-1_2563.463_3.157.wav_ASR	should she b needs to uh
71-1_2567.38_17.24.wav_ASR	and of course because she is so elegant uh attractive and shows up with this um uh really uh real type of chair she's traded as
71-1_2584.975_2.916.wav_ASR	is she the button opens the door
71-1_2588.095_0.812.wav_ASR	hello
71-1_2589.635_0.812.wav_ASR	he wants in that
71-1_2590.635_2.32.wav_ASR	immediately the print's just like
71-1_2593.435_0.658.wav_ASR	it's like that
71-1_2594.515_2.3.wav_ASR	it's like he's been stuck by lightning
71-1_2597.575_1.165.wav_ASR	he's the one i want to be
71-1_2598.975_1.165.wav_ASR	he heads over to her
71-1_2600.475_2.06.wav_ASR	there's an instinct
71-1_2604.46_2.0.wav_ASR	he dances with her the entire night
71-1_2606.82_5.16.wav_ASR	um he's pretty clear that maybe at this point memory is something in the world if i get to be with this one
71-1_2613.19_4.0.wav_ASR	and he's and sh and this point is pulling away
71-1_2617.56_0.34.wav_ASR	if you s
71-1_2618.12_0.46.wav_ASR	okay got a g
71-1_2618.76_0.34.wav_ASR	yes
71-1_2619.22_1.32.wav_ASR	oh no it's stick around
71-1_2620.94_0.6.wav_ASR	okay cool
71-1_2622.58_0.6.wav_ASR	let's see
71-1_2624.18_1.12.wav_ASR	oh this is it
71-1_2625.6_0.71.wav_ASR	oh i gotta get that
71-1_2626.5_0.52.wav_ASR	got a go
71-1_2627.3_5.8.wav_ASR	and she runs away uh at about two or three minutes to mid night because her she's
71-1_2633.26_1.166.wav_ASR	okay i got this curve
71-1_2634.56_0.786.wav_ASR	and i got to go away
71-1_2635.38_1.167.wav_ASR	shouldn't she
71-1_2637.7_2.81.wav_ASR	it all the sound she's i mean she's a really fast
71-1_2640.94_0.44.wav_ASR	so she's an
71-1_2641.38_4.57.wav_ASR	way but all theundred he sees that one of his shoes has been left there
71-1_2646.16_0.98.wav_ASR	uh glass lipper
71-1_2647.86_2.174.wav_ASR	um and so we pick that up
71-1_2650.2_3.24.wav_ASR	it's all he's got of her is this clip
71-1_2654.1_2.56.wav_ASR	so he goes back to his father and
71-1_2657.28_1.28.wav_ASR	uh i'll marry somebody
71-1_2658.86_1.868.wav_ASR	uh there's only one million i want to marry
71-1_2660.728_1.516.wav_ASR	and she's the one i wanna marry
71-1_2662.968_4.68.wav_ASR	and all i have is this clue that her foot will fit into this
71-1_2668.928_2.54.wav_ASR	it's sort of advertising a round the keyboard
71-1_2672.608_7.36.wav_ASR	one that can who's feet will fit into these laptops um the print will be c. as a connector
71-1_2680.85_7.16.wav_ASR	so the the step steps who you know they were ignored at the ball
71-1_2688.27_2.82.wav_ASR	but they're pretty sure they can get their feet into this slip
71-1_2692.05_1.6.wav_ASR	one in the front
71-1_2694.54_19.21.wav_ASR	so he's and and of course that this point taking care of the animals cleaning in the kitchen um wanting to take care of the animals
71-1_2714.59_1.81.wav_ASR	so the print starts dripping again
71-1_2716.91_4.25.wav_ASR	but w i mean it's this really bizarre sort of thing that he's writing about
71-1_2721.43_10.724.wav_ASR	people are running out taking out their shoes and seeing if their feet will fit into this slippery which is apparently designed specifically for this one single one
71-1_2733.67_1.9.wav_ASR	and he hands up and he stops it their hell
71-1_2735.77_6.34.wav_ASR	he's really discouraged this point because he hasn't yet found a one who's feet will fit into that um slide
71-1_2743.01_1.095.wav_ASR	stops at this hole
71-1_2744.37_2.793.wav_ASR	all of the stepsisters do everything they can
71-1_2747.29_3.08.wav_ASR	that they're feet are just too big or too long or
71-1_2750.71_0.798.wav_ASR	it's not work
71-1_2751.632_3.22.wav_ASR	and then all the sudden uh s
71-1_2755.261_2.278.wav_ASR	um he's just about ready to leave
71-1_2757.592_1.74.wav_ASR	oh he seems to see a movement
71-1_2760.172_5.59.wav_ASR	and he sees this other one like the mail who's just in the corner
71-1_2766.572_0.428.wav_ASR	and he said
71-1_2767.252_0.588.wav_ASR	it won't hurt
71-1_2768.83_1.36.wav_ASR	and uh steph
71-1_2770.312_0.798.wav_ASR	oh she's no
71-1_2771.5_0.97.wav_ASR	shoes
71-1_2773.43_1.84.wav_ASR	and she looks up
71-1_2775.92_5.43.wav_ASR	he the price just has this strange feeling about her and
71-1_2781.92_1.44.wav_ASR	it's like to have her come out
71-1_2783.78_7.311.wav_ASR	uh i'd like to s see if our feet will w i if this if the supplements will fit her feet
71-1_2791.091_2.035.wav_ASR	and so she comes in
71-1_2793.371_0.92.wav_ASR	she's a m
71-1_2794.711_3.639.wav_ASR	um you know she's been working in the kitchen and in the bathroom
71-1_2798.931_6.2.wav_ASR	isn't she's you know not not looking anyway like the process person that had begun at the
71-1_2805.87_0.8.wav_ASR	but she came out
71-1_2806.831_0.759.wav_ASR	he said
71-1_2808.51_3.56.wav_ASR	uh the print put the slider on his foot
71-1_2812.99_1.08.wav_ASR	and it fits
71-1_2814.73_0.98.wav_ASR	then he looked at it
71-1_2815.71_22.48.wav_ASR	and what was relevant is that he was able to see that it was exactly the same purpose even if she's clearly not of the same status that she had somehow the same
71-1_2839.43_15.337.wav_ASR	oh they're happily uh they'd love happily after until the pineapple because she was not um high enough
71-1_2854.767_18.19.wav_ASR	and they had to he had to remove his cradle and go to another continent and yeah and then start writing um produces red films nets and yeah and then stop writing
71-1_2872.957_0.84.wav_ASR	alright
71-1_2874.864_1.272.wav_ASR	oh yeah
71-1_2900.37_0.5.wav_ASR	okay
71-1_2905.61_1.0.wav_ASR	oh
71-1_2910.67_11.58.wav_ASR	um an interesting really irritating thing about clocks to me recently is that i went to a physical check
71-1_2923.03_2.831.wav_ASR	and i had just turned sixty five
71-1_2926.39_2.52.wav_ASR	so i had never experienced this before
71-1_2929.05_5.28.wav_ASR	and i thought it was my uni my analytical um physical
71-1_2935.52_1.03.wav_ASR	oh my god
71-1_2936.75_0.57.wav_ASR	let's start
71-1_2937.65_2.34.wav_ASR	the nest is checking my laptop
71-1_2940.41_4.62.wav_ASR	so you're checking you know the my part rate my pulse and all the other stuff
71-1_2945.73_3.06.wav_ASR	and then she handed me a piece of paper and a pen and say
71-1_2948.98_1.34.wav_ASR	that's like you to draw a col
71-1_2951.06_1.01.wav_ASR	yeah
71-1_2953.58_0.57.wav_ASR	and she said
71-1_2954.34_3.38.wav_ASR	because i i want to see what kind of picture you you can draw
71-1_2958.32_2.76.wav_ASR	so it seemed ridiculous
71-1_2961.62_1.027.wav_ASR	uh i did it anyway
71-1_2963.0_0.93.wav_ASR	ah i just
71-1_2964.52_9.32.wav_ASR	and i knew how to handle how to draw uh a picture appropriately with a clock which is you first you put down the twelve
71-1_2974.0_0.89.wav_ASR	and then you put on the s
71-1_2975.14_0.66.wav_ASR	and you put
71-1_2975.98_0.71.wav_ASR	then you put the n
71-1_2976.74_8.82.wav_ASR	and then you fill in the numbers so that everything is located um where it should be instead of you know having them too crowded
71-1_2986.12_3.09.wav_ASR	and then i had to draw the pictures of two forty five
71-1_2990.32_1.08.wav_ASR	um and i finished
71-1_2991.6_0.4.wav_ASR	let's see
71-1_2992.42_1.46.wav_ASR	oh is this what you want
71-1_2994.75_4.17.wav_ASR	or did you want to just look at what you have on the wall that's right there which is a c
71-1_2999.82_0.95.wav_ASR	and she said
71-1_3001.11_2.02.wav_ASR	um you have this
71-1_3003.49_0.32.wav_ASR	yes
71-1_3004.28_1.87.wav_ASR	is it essentially a dimension task
71-1_3006.254_13.939.wav_ASR	that's a that you are sixty five and you go in for a visualization of a p sorry when you go to see a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
71-1_3020.834_0.477.wav_ASR	and
71-1_3021.514_2.193.wav_ASR	one point will they stop doing this
71-1_3023.76_9.43.wav_ASR	but because um well i did indeed grow up with the you know the round
71-1_3033.8_1.68.wav_ASR	everything i do is digital
71-1_3035.807_16.95.wav_ASR	so what happens at what scenario will they decide that this is not the way to show that you do not have um a digital or a menu or that you simply have um a digital under starting of of what time is
71-1_3053.5_2.36.wav_ASR	oh anyway if i do it i'm not gonna do it anymore
71-1_3056.16_6.11.wav_ASR	and just gonna d uh maybe i'll just put down some digital stop and
71-1_3062.88_3.78.wav_ASR	oh my p. c. a. or something like ruud
71-1_3066.9_2.818.wav_ASR	uh anyway it's it's uh it's a test that they do
71-1_3069.718_3.888.wav_ASR	and i found it really irritating though i passed
71-1_3074.018_3.915.wav_ASR	um that it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's
71-1_3078.438_1.048.wav_ASR	yeah
71-1_3084.638_1.963.wav_ASR	let me see
71-1_3091.487_18.88.wav_ASR	one of the things i used to do when my daughter was younger is every guarantee um we would ahead to watch the email words
71-1_3110.83_14.71.wav_ASR	and what the email watch is is nothing of here on the business world there's one place that in the company the emails are on the way um somewhere else
71-1_3125.67_0.72.wav_ASR	they're coming back
71-1_3126.63_1.247.wav_ASR	going south or something
71-1_3127.877_5.666.wav_ASR	but they all show up in this label uh for about three or four days
71-1_3134.157_8.44.wav_ASR	and so what people do is they have groups um the autobahn size and other groups that show up with um
71-1_3144.23_4.65.wav_ASR	and we watch uh the the birds the eggs because you can see
71-1_3149.19_1.113.wav_ASR	it's really really close
71-1_3150.45_1.46.wav_ASR	you can see the
71-1_3152.49_1.454.wav_ASR	and you can see them with their
71-1_3154.33_2.28.wav_ASR	and there's just so many of them at one time
71-1_3157.17_2.038.wav_ASR	um in the basement we have a lot of hell
71-1_3159.43_4.8.wav_ASR	but we don't necessarily see bold the legs as much
71-1_3164.36_1.23.wav_ASR	it's much more ra
71-1_3166.48_4.788.wav_ASR	so um that's something that we did for a number of years
71-1_3171.36_2.94.wav_ASR	even when she was thirteen and wasn't really talking in the beginning
71-1_3174.98_2.763.wav_ASR	um we always had fun on that day
71-1_3177.96_0.725.wav_ASR	we would sh
71-1_3179.02_3.122.wav_ASR	the first you draw really more because it's gonna be twenty below
71-1_3182.59_3.58.wav_ASR	um we would go to the banks with banana
71-1_3186.63_2.08.wav_ASR	we would wait for the eggs to show up
71-1_3188.91_1.44.wav_ASR	we would watch them for a li
71-1_3190.65_2.38.wav_ASR	then we would go have
71-1_3193.31_2.86.wav_ASR	and she'll talk that time
71-1_3196.61_2.19.wav_ASR	when we are home then it was
71-1_3199.11_0.88.wav_ASR	okay this is my
71-1_3200.21_0.568.wav_ASR	oh okay
71-1_3200.778_1.896.wav_ASR	oh don't talk to my friends
71-1_3202.738_13.726.wav_ASR	but there is always that one um ready even in those very very difficult early years that my da always talk to me after we watched the legs
71-1_3216.464_5.16.wav_ASR	so that's one of the a things that i would think of when i think of the word
71-1_3227.38_1.01.wav_ASR	what what is the word again
71-1_3230.244_2.56.wav_ASR	oh i don't know if you wanna hear that story
71-1_3233.039_0.485.wav_ASR	oh
71-1_3233.991_2.78.wav_ASR	well i okay
71-1_3236.777_13.094.wav_ASR	you can tell you uh a recent one um that will clearly not be um rated r. or any thing because really when you start it in that one it could be way more interesting
71-1_3250.021_10.775.wav_ASR	um i will s talk about something i did last summer um um since my stroke i've been trying to push myself a little bit
71-1_3260.881_2.569.wav_ASR	again i'm i'm much more tired than i used to be
71-1_3263.61_5.251.wav_ASR	but um i'm still trying to push my batteries to find out exactly what's possible
71-1_3268.93_1.28.wav_ASR	well and how much can i do
71-1_3270.29_1.827.wav_ASR	and how long can i draw
71-1_3272.13_3.6.wav_ASR	and how many hours a day can i b you know be active
71-1_3275.741_2.789.wav_ASR	and um so i work with this now profit
71-1_3279.53_5.7.wav_ASR	and we were having a event in northern wisconsin off the um the norman resolution
71-1_3285.397_2.48.wav_ASR	and it's a our our group is called
71-1_3289.337_1.68.wav_ASR	we do with m. m. i. dot u. shou
71-1_3291.677_3.779.wav_ASR	so i b i had up for this well
71-1_3295.737_1.06.wav_ASR	um i had to get up
71-1_3296.957_5.26.wav_ASR	think i left town at five to get up there by eight
71-1_3302.331_5.519.wav_ASR	we had ads all day long and talking and you know different things going on and
71-1_3307.891_1.32.wav_ASR	it was really really hot
71-1_3310.051_3.538.wav_ASR	the i was ready to drive home by five o'clock
71-1_3314.151_2.269.wav_ASR	the about an hour on the
71-1_3317.011_2.559.wav_ASR	about three and a half hour uh three and a half our third
71-1_3319.71_2.98.wav_ASR	it decided i can't dry any more
71-1_3323.47_1.68.wav_ASR	my head is just
71-1_3326.15_3.68.wav_ASR	um i just i needed to sleep really quickly
71-1_3329.87_2.42.wav_ASR	ah i've learned to listen to myself
71-1_3332.61_4.86.wav_ASR	my body says you're tired um you pull over and you
71-1_3337.649_5.112.wav_ASR	it don't just like a round three a half coffee and you know keep on going
71-1_3343.27_1.34.wav_ASR	so i pulled into this hotel
71-1_3345.85_1.66.wav_ASR	um it it looks like i thought
71-1_3347.849_3.041.wav_ASR	you know i didn't have a residual r reservation or any
71-1_3351.11_9.614.wav_ASR	and i was just looking for a place that had an opening so i could go in and get out of the sun and uh you know cover my eyes and not have to dry any more
71-1_3360.85_10.96.wav_ASR	but because i was as tired as i was and because i was pushed to my boundaries um uh my age uh i had clearly failed
71-1_3372.95_2.18.wav_ASR	oh i walked in this
71-1_3375.69_3.36.wav_ASR	and um there are lots of i mean clearly there are lot of buttons
71-1_3379.64_2.57.wav_ASR	um well actually i didn't know that
71-1_3382.66_1.98.wav_ASR	um but i thought it said
71-1_3385.14_0.809.wav_ASR	but i wasn't sure
71-1_3386.18_0.937.wav_ASR	and i wanted in the door
71-1_3388.0_2.42.wav_ASR	and there's this one behind the the dash
71-1_3390.82_0.48.wav_ASR	and i s
71-1_3391.54_2.24.wav_ASR	now d um i'm here for a room
71-1_3394.62_0.32.wav_ASR	let's see
71-1_3395.02_1.08.wav_ASR	do have any extras
71-1_3397.62_5.68.wav_ASR	and and of course that's what happens with the phase uh is you say
71-1_3403.92_3.86.wav_ASR	yeah no variations could have a man uh a response to a cube
71-1_3408.16_3.161.wav_ASR	um we are we're laughing man
71-1_3411.64_1.783.wav_ASR	and they're being very careful about that
71-1_3413.72_2.58.wav_ASR	um but of so of course i was trying to s
71-1_3416.34_1.56.wav_ASR	it do you have a p
71-1_3418.62_1.778.wav_ASR	oh no
71-1_3420.7_1.02.wav_ASR	you have a basic
71-1_3422.16_3.26.wav_ASR	and a little bit into her coffee pro
71-1_3426.26_1.62.wav_ASR	yeah everybody here is being activated
71-1_3428.38_0.711.wav_ASR	oh we're already
71-1_3429.38_0.988.wav_ASR	wait everything down
71-1_3430.72_0.54.wav_ASR	and just say
71-1_3431.88_0.98.wav_ASR	so you have a room
71-1_3433.14_0.664.wav_ASR	and she said
71-1_3433.92_1.033.wav_ASR	yes yes yes yes
71-1_3435.16_0.545.wav_ASR	don't work
71-1_3435.705_1.0.wav_ASR	we folded it
71-1_3436.845_0.623.wav_ASR	it don't matter
71-1_3437.565_1.797.wav_ASR	all you're not gonna get it here
71-1_3439.805_1.863.wav_ASR	uh um she gave me a remote
71-1_3441.825_6.66.wav_ASR	and i realised that was one way to cover things up it's you just go with it you know
71-1_3448.76_1.911.wav_ASR	we want it if she had a vase in it
71-1_3451.44_0.31.wav_ASR	let's see
71-1_3452.165_0.98.wav_ASR	you have a b
71-1_3453.98_1.77.wav_ASR	and so we just want with backs
71-1_3456.24_2.03.wav_ASR	and then finally i w my way back
71-1_3459.14_2.56.wav_ASR	you have an empty room that i can sleep in
71-1_3462.68_5.02.wav_ASR	so i got the room in front of a lot of cold water and literally stopped for twelve hours
71-1_3468.94_0.48.wav_ASR	yeah
71-1_3471.54_2.08.wav_ASR	so that's that's another
71-1_3478.5_0.5.wav_ASR	oh
71-1_3480.14_0.8.wav_ASR	um
71-1_3481.62_20.94.wav_ASR	um i was if i was going to choose something to talk about how i paid my way through um my underwear um which is true
71-1_3504.63_14.68.wav_ASR	uh i wasted uh beginning at um at kind of a little coffee shop that was um near where i lived because i had no car
71-1_3520.12_1.31.wav_ASR	um and i could just bite there
71-1_3522.42_1.45.wav_ASR	and they were very very kind
71-1_3524.03_2.94.wav_ASR	and i did the research
71-1_3528.1_14.32.wav_ASR	but i learned very quickly after about six months that you would get paid ten to fifteen percent um as a tip based on the prices of the restaurant
71-1_3543.14_8.24.wav_ASR	what made sense was to find the restaurant that was the most expensive in terms of prices and were there
71-1_3552.167_3.873.wav_ASR	uh d doing the exact same s same part of service
71-1_3556.39_19.218.wav_ASR	if they're only paying five dollars for their mail and they're handing you forty cents that's not not gonna be nearly as good as if they'd send you two or four dollars for it
71-1_3575.98_5.36.wav_ASR	so what i learned to do is keep going to more and more and more expensive rest
71-1_3582.46_20.82.wav_ASR	um i mean the the the the um that's good if not bad stories that are the uh really um
71-1_3604.84_2.74.wav_ASR	oh um that's what i ended up doing
71-1_3608.2_4.664.wav_ASR	and uh but again i it what was so interesting to me is that i worked just as hard
71-1_3613.32_4.157.wav_ASR	and i use the same sort of um you know
71-1_3618.84_5.61.wav_ASR	you have to sort of keep a revealing list of tasks that you're in the middle of doing
71-1_3624.45_1.994.wav_ASR	whether you're going to the bar or getting ready
71-1_3626.65_1.508.wav_ASR	you're going here to get your foot
71-1_3628.39_1.405.wav_ASR	you're gonna go people more
71-1_3630.11_0.946.wav_ASR	you gonna give me your chat
71-1_3631.51_5.578.wav_ASR	you have to keep them all kind of revolution all at one time
71-1_3637.31_4.757.wav_ASR	try to decide exactly how you're going to prioritise each of those tasks
71-1_3642.067_10.0.wav_ASR	so um it's really i mean be wiring being a website is a really um managing um
71-1_3653.687_3.66.wav_ASR	uh it's just bizarre that they don't pay people anymore money to do that
71-1_3657.49_4.33.wav_ASR	it was luckily because i made enough money that i was still able to grade
71-1_3662.01_8.22.wav_ASR	and i wasn't paying the degree of the amount of money that grade students are paying now which is out
71-1_3672.05_0.61.wav_ASR	but
71-1_3673.93_2.38.wav_ASR	oh yeah
71-1_3676.61_1.701.wav_ASR	the gradient scroll that was very different
71-1_3678.311_5.3.wav_ASR	but yeah i had no students because i worked as a wizard in research
71-1_3698.06_0.59.wav_ASR	yeah
71-1_3699.03_2.999.wav_ASR	and it's it is it's really totally kind of like
71-1_3703.14_1.235.wav_ASR	got you know three minutes
71-1_3704.68_0.709.wav_ASR	it can go get that
71-1_3705.62_0.591.wav_ASR	okay
71-1_3706.54_0.366.wav_ASR	oh
71-1_3707.62_2.536.wav_ASR	just sort of like it's it's kind of a challenge
71-1_3710.2_0.816.wav_ASR	it's kind of fun
71-1_3713.34_0.455.wav_ASR	yeah
71-1_3718.76_0.845.wav_ASR	it can't be c
71-1_3719.76_0.59.wav_ASR	then you need
71-1_3720.7_1.28.wav_ASR	you need more coffee over
71-1_3722.26_0.96.wav_ASR	you got this going on
71-1_3723.52_4.32.wav_ASR	and i will say that um the second place i worked i carried it
71-1_3728.62_8.414.wav_ASR	and when i get a physical they were trying to figure out why this mouse on this arm was stronger than this one
71-1_3738.16_0.74.wav_ASR	is something going on
71-1_3739.09_0.75.wav_ASR	there's a roo
71-1_3739.97_0.49.wav_ASR	and i s
71-1_3740.68_1.82.wav_ASR	oh i'm just really sorry
71-1_3743.1_1.92.wav_ASR	uh yeah
71-1_3753.971_14.825.wav_ASR	um well if i'm going to make um penna butter and yellow sandwich by giving out the bread
71-1_3769.311_2.802.wav_ASR	and taking out two slides is a red
71-1_3772.113_2.019.wav_ASR	and and leaning them on the table
71-1_3774.633_8.24.wav_ASR	then i would go and get the jar of jelly and the jar of pineapple
71-1_3783.713_4.173.wav_ASR	and i would bring probably a spoon and a night with me
71-1_3788.57_2.863.wav_ASR	it would begin with the pineapple
71-1_3792.068_2.272.wav_ASR	it's really difficult to decide is it
71-1_3794.488_0.84.wav_ASR	kinetic
71-1_3796.268_4.045.wav_ASR	and i would spend that on the on one side of the red
71-1_3800.828_3.96.wav_ASR	the other piece of red i would put on
71-1_3805.108_1.06.wav_ASR	would you use a s
71-1_3806.568_1.011.wav_ASR	and i would pull out the j
71-1_3807.92_4.373.wav_ASR	and i would spend that evenly on that piece of red
71-1_3812.7_2.72.wav_ASR	then i would close the two of them together
71-1_3816.12_6.32.wav_ASR	it would close um screw the tops back on the yellow and the pineapple
71-1_3822.66_0.63.wav_ASR	put them away
71-1_3823.88_1.4.wav_ASR	then i would eat my sandwich
71-1_3832.11_5.6.wav_ASR	well i don't do it often
71-1_3838.45_1.708.wav_ASR	oh that's not a sheet
71-1_3840.85_15.069.wav_ASR	um i would si when i do my laundry um divide the fact that i do have uh a washing machine down stars i tend to go to the one longer mat because i can do all of it at one time
71-1_3856.37_2.654.wav_ASR	and i only wanna do it like once a week or every other week
71-1_3859.024_4.476.wav_ASR	oh because it's just something i find kind of boring to do
71-1_3863.904_3.04.wav_ASR	oh what i do is
71-1_3868.044_1.74.wav_ASR	fact i have to do this tomorrow
71-1_3870.184_1.23.wav_ASR	so let me think about this
71-1_3871.644_3.54.wav_ASR	oh all of my deadlines
71-1_3875.33_5.584.wav_ASR	and i usually use the smell test um to find out whether n they go into the hammer or not
71-1_3880.914_18.7.wav_ASR	um when i decide that everything needs to be washed which also will include the tools and the other uh tools cloth hands that are hanging up in the kitchen um i would all of them in
71-1_3900.01_5.52.wav_ASR	it would um use a controller of logger log
71-1_3907.24_0.66.wav_ASR	it would put that
71-1_3908.31_4.39.wav_ASR	would carry it to the back side of my the back seat of my car
71-1_3913.6_8.52.wav_ASR	uh would get m i would make sure i had colours or had caps that i could use for the quarter machine in the launcher
71-1_3923.11_1.57.wav_ASR	it would go to the launcher
71-1_3924.88_6.327.wav_ASR	it would find the largest machine that was available that i could do all of my language at one time in one machine
71-1_3931.207_5.18.wav_ASR	oh i would put the ladder in
71-1_3937.23_12.357.wav_ASR	um if they didn't al it i would make sure that the the clothing that would be washed at a higher uh a lower temperature would go into a separate smaller washing machine
71-1_3950.36_1.814.wav_ASR	uh make sure the top is in
71-1_3952.46_2.068.wav_ASR	uh would make sure i had enough
71-1_3955.36_6.792.wav_ASR	and then i would probably go by foot or something um they're being lost
71-1_3962.36_0.924.wav_ASR	uh come back
71-1_3963.54_1.44.wav_ASR	the in the triangle
71-1_3965.86_2.403.wav_ASR	uh i don't really fall them the way i'm supposed to
71-1_3968.54_0.71.wav_ASR	it just can
71-1_3969.66_4.29.wav_ASR	and then put them away kind of um as i use them when i
71-1_3985.92_4.75.wav_ASR	um you mean what would i choose to wear or
71-1_3995.3_0.57.wav_ASR	oh
71-1_3996.39_11.38.wav_ASR	well the first thing i would do every morning is start my coffee because that really is going to have to happen before i make decisions about what matches what
71-1_4008.33_2.38.wav_ASR	oh i would prefer the
71-1_4011.9_2.75.wav_ASR	um i usually do the four over
71-1_4015.51_1.41.wav_ASR	and i really
71-1_4017.61_2.19.wav_ASR	so it would grind the cat
71-1_4020.33_1.78.wav_ASR	start the the water
71-1_4023.83_2.36.wav_ASR	um i would go into my bed
71-1_4026.63_3.12.wav_ASR	generally i have some idea of what i'm gonna do
71-1_4030.63_3.28.wav_ASR	um if only because i have to dump stuff out sometime
71-1_4033.91_1.26.wav_ASR	and i don't wanna have any
71-1_4035.602_4.45.wav_ASR	it don't want i don't really have time to look a lot in the morning
71-1_4040.49_2.54.wav_ASR	so i'm gonna prepare an idea of what i'm gonna wear already
71-1_4043.51_5.14.wav_ASR	um so i usually um start well clearly underwood
71-1_4049.59_3.481.wav_ASR	and then whatever pants or skirt i'm wearing
71-1_4053.071_3.66.wav_ASR	and um that point it the water is usually ready
71-1_4057.231_2.079.wav_ASR	oh yeah i got my lines closed
71-1_4059.631_10.319.wav_ASR	um yeah running around here half dreams and then figuring out what kind of shirt i'm gonna wear um whether or not trying to make decisions about how cool it is
71-1_4070.191_1.359.wav_ASR	so i need the where i have these
71-1_4071.75_1.32.wav_ASR	it do i need to write one
71-1_4073.07_2.819.wav_ASR	um well the company is being made
71-1_4076.37_2.828.wav_ASR	but the time the copy is made i've got all my basic clothes on
71-1_4079.87_6.666.wav_ASR	then i take the coffee with me um in the background when i make decisions about ears and hair and all that
71-1_4086.94_4.822.wav_ASR	but uh yeah the basic is all the escape's the night before so i don't have to worry about it
71-1_4091.79_5.715.wav_ASR	and if i absolutely am tired and i don't know what i'm doing i just wrap black because it matches everythin
71-1_4098.11_1.432.wav_ASR	oh i have a lot of blank spaces
71-1_4100.07_0.77.wav_ASR	oh there's that
71-2_14.77_15.16.wav_ASR	um i think my favourite part about where i live and i live on the nearest easiest um about a mile away from the capital is that i'm close to the lake
71-2_30.89_1.34.wav_ASR	but matthew is a pity
71-2_32.41_2.38.wav_ASR	we we have four different legs that are here
71-2_35.21_8.54.wav_ASR	and the matrix actually comes from a word from osh that actually specifically means
71-2_44.69_5.4.wav_ASR	um so a block away from where i live is uh
71-2_50.725_3.302.wav_ASR	and it's the biggest of the
71-2_54.665_6.7.wav_ASR	and what i like the most about it is there's a bite past to my
71-2_62.83_6.42.wav_ASR	the label is too my left um with a running pass that goes along it
71-2_70.27_7.38.wav_ASR	and i literally can get pretty much anyway than i need to go on in the city of amsterdam without having to
71-2_79.43_1.82.wav_ASR	it's i'm very close to the
71-2_82.17_4.02.wav_ASR	so one of the things i do when i run
71-2_86.95_2.98.wav_ASR	oh i would pretty much call it fast walk
71-2_90.071_3.86.wav_ASR	oh no not not from my
71-2_94.531_6.34.wav_ASR	in my prime i was i would run about seven or eight miles a morning
71-2_100.931_2.26.wav_ASR	and i would get it down by about seven minutes
71-2_103.351_3.4.wav_ASR	oh i'm pretty much just walking and
71-2_107.621_3.7.wav_ASR	and we're more like a eleven minute um miles
71-2_111.741_2.56.wav_ASR	oh but i usually get about five in every morning
71-2_114.621_7.309.wav_ASR	um it's it's it's kind of mediocre in the sense that you can look at the bottom
71-2_122.181_1.029.wav_ASR	you can see the board
71-2_123.87_10.3.wav_ASR	um it's just much um satisfying that would be t to be an uh triangle
71-2_134.77_3.32.wav_ASR	so it's one of the things i really like about where i live
71-2_139.91_1.36.wav_ASR	the red
71-2_142.244_0.5.wav_ASR	oh
71-2_144.217_0.467.wav_ASR	oh
71-2_144.93_1.073.wav_ASR	uh i don't think that i'm
71-2_146.764_2.154.wav_ASR	oh that's the right word that i mean
71-2_149.284_0.5.wav_ASR	and you mean
71-2_153.748_0.593.wav_ASR	oh what is it
71-2_155.384_1.306.wav_ASR	oh i just see the word
71-2_156.884_0.526.wav_ASR	let me keep it
71-2_157.764_1.566.wav_ASR	oh i'm screwing that
71-2_159.584_0.92.wav_ASR	oh i wasn't
71-2_160.706_2.562.wav_ASR	times i hear a word that i already know
71-2_163.426_0.544.wav_ASR	let's keep it
71-2_164.206_1.044.wav_ASR	that i'm saying that wrong
71-2_165.746_4.624.wav_ASR	um but i i just have to be re acquainted with words that i actually already know
71-2_171.106_0.564.wav_ASR	oh yeah
71-2_173.086_3.54.wav_ASR	well on the back is much better than being on a red mail
71-2_177.146_2.769.wav_ASR	uh and the black away which is why i like living here
71-2_179.915_0.5.wav_ASR	yeah
71-2_200.31_2.58.wav_ASR	again my speech is not reliable
71-2_204.23_8.987.wav_ASR	but the most part when i speak i know what i'm going to say
71-2_213.77_16.481.wav_ASR	but if i try to say something that's more complicated um my words that i like to say that
71-2_230.251_8.589.wav_ASR	or the words are in my brain but i'm not quite able to articulate them the way that i want to
71-2_238.97_3.38.wav_ASR	um generally i know right away when i'm done with a statement
71-2_243.091_1.339.wav_ASR	oh but sometimes i don't
71-2_244.631_2.0.wav_ASR	guess anyway i i said to someone
71-2_246.696_3.48.wav_ASR	uh well we got this election coming up and generator four
71-2_250.676_1.27.wav_ASR	and she
71-2_253.536_0.404.wav_ASR	okay
71-2_253.94_0.621.wav_ASR	that's apple
71-2_254.576_0.84.wav_ASR	and i said
71-2_255.492_0.747.wav_ASR	what did i say
71-2_256.376_0.528.wav_ASR	and you say
71-2_256.996_0.815.wav_ASR	you said yeah
71-2_258.98_1.021.wav_ASR	well it feels like a j
71-2_260.696_3.525.wav_ASR	again i th tried to just wind those and figure out a way to get past it
71-2_264.41_8.22.wav_ASR	but i simply cannot that what will come out of my mouth is what i'm actually trying to
71-2_273.01_14.82.wav_ASR	and i don't know how to do how to fix that except to keep trying to replace them and try to catch them faster i get
71-2_295.73_2.62.wav_ASR	yes i remember exactly when i had a stroke
71-2_298.52_5.42.wav_ASR	had a stroke on anyway fifty twenty
71-2_320.33_14.302.wav_ASR	so i essentially had uh button clip um to my right temporary logo and did not know what it was um for two days
71-2_335.13_1.573.wav_ASR	and then of course they admitted me
71-2_336.703_9.4.wav_ASR	but it was past the window of opportunity to be able to give me some type of ducks that might have um broken up the clat
71-2_347.563_2.227.wav_ASR	oh i entered the hotel
71-2_350.403_1.92.wav_ASR	it emerged i would have another stroke
71-2_353.183_0.607.wav_ASR	uh have not
71-2_354.09_4.36.wav_ASR	and they have not able to find the costs of the initial
71-2_359.72_1.67.wav_ASR	yes it was the perfect scroll
71-2_362.04_12.44.wav_ASR	and i assume it might have been a commitment of working out really hard um being uh stressed because of the panic and not being able to have uh crisis
71-2_374.76_2.765.wav_ASR	those were pre analysis anyway
71-2_378.52_3.0.wav_ASR	we were in a position then where it was pretty isolated
71-2_381.743_3.632.wav_ASR	and and i don't know what else it could have been
71-2_385.583_5.67.wav_ASR	literally there's there is physically nothing wrong with my body
71-2_391.703_3.994.wav_ASR	and all of my numbers uh indicate that i should not have a stroke
71-2_395.843_2.223.wav_ASR	and yet yeah i had a stroke
71-2_398.363_1.62.wav_ASR	so yeah
71-2_400.181_2.92.wav_ASR	the r. t. n. graphic
71-2_403.981_4.263.wav_ASR	which at some point i um you just move on that i guess
71-2_408.721_0.379.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
71-2_418.32_17.68.wav_ASR	um well as i said a week ago uh that's been sold um to the direction of a library or uh hell from any material
71-2_437.57_8.66.wav_ASR	and i think that's kind of a Travesty in the sense that um people have that have had
71-2_446.73_3.68.wav_ASR	it was characterised as having a mild schematic
71-2_451.57_12.92.wav_ASR	um we were we are in the presentation or the potential to come uh to completely recover in the right kinds of traits and um certain time
71-2_464.99_16.04.wav_ASR	so i think the first six months after stroke is really cruel in terms of rapidity um that your brain is able to generate um to bring back language
71-2_482.13_11.14.wav_ASR	um i'm really disappointed in the administration hell in the sense that i was not given what i should have got
71-2_493.53_18.08.wav_ASR	so what i've done on my own is um the quality of my uh the quality of my um style uh of of design
71-2_511.89_1.417.wav_ASR	have already s observed that
71-2_513.307_1.654.wav_ASR	it's done for about ten years
71-2_515.327_10.103.wav_ASR	um i gave up drawing completely um though i don't really think that was an issue since i was drawing maybe one glass a month
71-2_525.43_10.02.wav_ASR	um but it might increase um fluctuation no inflammation
71-2_536.21_4.1.wav_ASR	it w it might increase implementation in my body
71-2_540.325_10.3.wav_ASR	and that's something that i'm trying to work um
71-2_551.465_1.7.wav_ASR	uh i've increased my error size
71-2_553.585_1.6.wav_ASR	again i'm already
71-2_559.81_19.778.wav_ASR	oh i'd increase the competitiveness the very consciousness that i'd do every single day to make sure that um i can make sure that my focus and uh that um i can make sure that it's relatively high
71-2_579.588_2.895.wav_ASR	ah again i was an accident
71-2_582.748_15.385.wav_ASR	oh i have already um done a lot of reading every day during a lot of reading every day
71-2_598.133_2.617.wav_ASR	that done it much more consistently than in the past
71-2_601.85_7.16.wav_ASR	um writing is always reliable in the sense that i have the option of uh
71-2_609.473_2.297.wav_ASR	and i do sometimes use the wrong word
71-2_612.753_2.617.wav_ASR	uh you're you're generally caught it when i add it yeah
71-2_615.79_3.34.wav_ASR	and i always had to add it before the stroke too
71-2_619.37_9.39.wav_ASR	so i don't know to what extent those are connected to the stroke um objects or whether that's just the way that i write
71-2_628.91_4.36.wav_ASR	sometimes uh y you do a a rough draft to get the ideas out
71-2_633.443_2.915.wav_ASR	and then you refine it the second time around
71-2_637.303_9.727.wav_ASR	so i i th i think the only difference from the way in which i live my life after this stroke then before is making sure that i always get enough s
71-2_647.963_4.187.wav_ASR	um before the stroke i tried to get sleep
71-2_652.45_7.12.wav_ASR	but if i didn't i just poured on because i have a schedule that i have to
71-2_660.87_8.901.wav_ASR	um now it's it's a priority for me to the extent um that i have available to me to make sure that i sleep as much as i can
71-2_670.05_5.06.wav_ASR	um but then i just have a reservation every single day that i'm al always done
71-2_676.49_0.563.wav_ASR	really well
71-2_677.41_1.165.wav_ASR	exactly every day
71-2_679.05_2.72.wav_ASR	um push my brain as much as i can
71-2_682.23_7.28.wav_ASR	may try to i made attempt to take back um a language skill
71-2_689.79_3.4.wav_ASR	uh i was taking spanish classes before the
71-2_693.397_2.653.wav_ASR	um i took print when i was in high school
71-2_696.33_3.6.wav_ASR	uh i picked up a little bit of danny's when i lived in copeland
71-2_701.01_4.263.wav_ASR	but i thought sponges would be much more useful than fronts
71-2_706.37_2.1.wav_ASR	so i started taking a fancy clip
71-2_708.69_4.73.wav_ASR	and i had to i had to delete it because it was late at night
71-2_713.57_1.99.wav_ASR	it's just really wasn't working out for me
71-2_716.7_10.19.wav_ASR	but from what i read recently i think one of the things that might be really helpful to recap my english is to pick up some
71-2_727.56_1.88.wav_ASR	it's i you know i don't
71-2_729.6_1.14.wav_ASR	thought it might be confusing
71-2_731.12_2.971.wav_ASR	it's why not try it you know
71-2_734.091_1.949.wav_ASR	yeah
71-2_736.54_3.066.wav_ASR	oh yeah that may be what i do next i think
71-2_739.76_1.333.wav_ASR	um what i'm already doing
71-2_767.08_3.158.wav_ASR	let me see
71-2_771.54_4.68.wav_ASR	um oh a s sad
71-2_779.25_0.7.wav_ASR	um
71-2_782.83_5.9.wav_ASR	it's gonna talk about my reaction to what happened on nine eleven and two thousand and one
71-2_790.19_2.46.wav_ASR	ah it is um
71-2_793.11_3.98.wav_ASR	it's the beginning of uh the spring season in two thousand and one
71-2_797.09_4.16.wav_ASR	and my daughter had gone to school
71-2_803.03_9.82.wav_ASR	so as soon as she left at uh about eight fifteen i turned uh i got on the computer because i had to finish my sale
71-2_813.15_3.66.wav_ASR	yes i had already sh i i should have already finished my c
71-2_817.67_1.9.wav_ASR	um and it was generally done
71-2_819.73_2.089.wav_ASR	but i was kinda playing with some of the end of
71-2_822.23_5.923.wav_ASR	oh my third policy class because i just want it to it's just updated a little bit
71-2_828.41_1.08.wav_ASR	so i wasn't online
71-2_830.33_2.92.wav_ASR	um obviously the radio is not because i had to concentrate
71-2_833.352_4.423.wav_ASR	or uh i certainly wasn't watching television when i was trying to do my work
71-2_837.872_12.614.wav_ASR	so i was in this like sound um silence with no connection to doin' through these different articles and designing which one would fit best in terms of what i was trying to do
71-2_851.51_5.54.wav_ASR	and at two o'clock in the afternoon um i was gonna take a break
71-2_857.21_3.32.wav_ASR	it was gonna go to my job and uh work out
71-2_861.07_1.14.wav_ASR	and it was a beautiful day
71-2_862.61_1.64.wav_ASR	but you know sample
71-2_868.85_0.8.wav_ASR	nei turn on
71-2_870.87_3.98.wav_ASR	and the the announcer said
71-2_875.69_2.16.wav_ASR	don't really know if the skills are gonna close
71-2_878.53_0.64.wav_ASR	like a c
71-2_879.77_1.12.wav_ASR	the scores are gonna close
71-2_881.09_0.48.wav_ASR	oh
71-2_888.143_3.145.wav_ASR	um and i got the the job
71-2_892.33_2.473.wav_ASR	and they're televisions um
71-2_895.423_2.206.wav_ASR	we're in the desert when you come in
71-2_897.723_1.36.wav_ASR	that never exists
71-2_899.443_1.827.wav_ASR	everybody looked really stupid
71-2_901.963_1.96.wav_ASR	so i i'm walking in there saying
71-2_904.483_2.874.wav_ASR	thing happened here that i don't know about
71-2_907.37_1.5.wav_ASR	but everybody else knows about
71-2_909.35_2.12.wav_ASR	they're all staring at the screen
71-2_911.55_3.34.wav_ASR	so i went to the section where my red
71-2_915.83_3.818.wav_ASR	um and again the red mils were not anyway here is running along the layout
71-2_919.77_3.262.wav_ASR	but that's what i was gonna do that day because i had to do some writing
71-2_923.27_1.915.wav_ASR	and that's what i thought
71-2_925.185_12.8.wav_ASR	uh at that point by two and a half in the afternoon they were just replaying it over and then again about the two lines that were hitting the um the wind tunnels in delay
71-2_938.265_2.813.wav_ASR	and they were introducing people who were trying to get away
71-2_941.365_1.64.wav_ASR	everything is covered with ashes
71-2_944.49_6.22.wav_ASR	and i remember getting on the the triple mals and um you know putting on my headphones and listening to
71-2_951.07_7.56.wav_ASR	uh i just kept going faster and faster uh because the administrator of what it happened was just so short
71-2_959.41_3.86.wav_ASR	so i kinda use that you know to uh increase my work
71-2_963.53_2.82.wav_ASR	and i got out of that
71-2_966.61_1.02.wav_ASR	and i went home and said
71-2_967.91_0.384.wav_ASR	yeah
71-2_968.294_4.966.wav_ASR	that got a really close friend um that limits in d. c. that works near the pigo
71-2_973.35_2.086.wav_ASR	and so is he
71-2_975.69_0.829.wav_ASR	it what's going on
71-2_977.21_0.94.wav_ASR	so i tried to call
71-2_978.45_3.78.wav_ASR	of course i couldn't get through because the the signals were d were d
71-2_982.23_3.06.wav_ASR	um um no one could get home in the delay
71-2_985.57_1.836.wav_ASR	everything is uh shot
71-2_988.71_2.16.wav_ASR	uh got on um i got on mine
71-2_991.09_0.94.wav_ASR	let's start e. m.
71-2_992.31_1.48.wav_ASR	but i email my department
71-2_993.97_1.78.wav_ASR	that's in the practical design department
71-2_995.93_0.34.wav_ASR	it's a
71-2_996.81_2.067.wav_ASR	we're gonna have a panel on the camp
71-2_999.41_1.76.wav_ASR	we're gonna invite the committee
71-2_1001.32_2.481.wav_ASR	and we're going to explain what is going on
71-2_1004.36_5.934.wav_ASR	and um um uh we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna explore all of that
71-2_1010.3_3.871.wav_ASR	we're gonna explain the apologies of it
71-2_1014.18_3.5.wav_ASR	we're gonna um talk about the history of
71-2_1018.48_2.588.wav_ASR	we're gonna explain exactly what is going on here
71-2_1021.068_3.442.wav_ASR	and uh everybody got back to me and
71-2_1024.788_2.32.wav_ASR	but they everyone responded said
71-2_1027.288_1.502.wav_ASR	it'd be happy to talk about this
71-2_1029.048_5.302.wav_ASR	it'd be happy to talk about the segments in a r. that are going on currently
71-2_1034.35_7.22.wav_ASR	and maybe that's related to what's going on with the um the bammers that are
71-2_1041.762_18.784.wav_ASR	and the we all in that point that we were coming from the middle east and that um the target and the winner i guess
71-2_1060.546_2.0.wav_ASR	and and how it is that we're gonna
71-2_1063.386_1.58.wav_ASR	they were employees with us
71-2_1066.026_2.694.wav_ASR	oh um yeah it all came together really
71-2_1069.006_1.514.wav_ASR	went to bed at one o'clock in the morning
71-2_1071.126_4.007.wav_ASR	um finally got the email back from my friend in d. c. who is fine
71-2_1075.986_3.141.wav_ASR	got up went to caps the next day
71-2_1079.127_3.12.wav_ASR	and the all the legs the legs were just scratch
71-2_1082.467_8.34.wav_ASR	and all we did is talk about what happened in every single class uh hour after hour after our
71-2_1091.927_2.073.wav_ASR	oh okay that's that's a lot
71-2_1094.327_0.6.wav_ASR	yeah
71-2_1095.507_3.195.wav_ASR	it was a great panel by the way
71-2_1098.702_2.177.wav_ASR	we had i think we had five hundred people
71-2_1101.002_4.48.wav_ASR	it's standing long uh standing
71-2_1106.562_0.607.wav_ASR	my turn to say
71-2_1107.262_1.0.wav_ASR	is that standing
71-2_1108.642_3.021.wav_ASR	people had to stand in the back
71-2_1111.942_1.56.wav_ASR	what i'm trying to say is
71-2_1115.89_2.82.wav_ASR	ah these phases that i used to say
71-2_1118.87_0.92.wav_ASR	my start to say that
71-2_1119.99_1.393.wav_ASR	and i forget with the other in the middle
71-2_1122.11_1.8.wav_ASR	standing room on
71-2_1124.33_0.389.wav_ASR	yeah
71-2_1124.719_2.671.wav_ASR	filled up the place basically
71-2_1127.69_1.1.wav_ASR	and everybody's question
71-2_1129.59_0.76.wav_ASR	did they hate us
71-2_1130.57_2.4.wav_ASR	um and that's what we began with
71-2_1133.59_0.94.wav_ASR	oh oh
71-2_1136.424_12.445.wav_ASR	but i miss the whole thing because of course i was on line writing a lecture that i know um you know um
71-2_1189.34_19.84.wav_ASR	well it seems to be taking uh um anyway this is relatively um in the shoulders um because the horns are relatively close to each other
71-2_1209.06_5.336.wav_ASR	and it looks like what's going on is uh a boy is in the back here
71-2_1214.88_2.2.wav_ASR	he's playing with his soccer
71-2_1217.52_1.92.wav_ASR	it's practicing his car
71-2_1220.38_11.126.wav_ASR	and unfortunately this time the bell uh the b well not not go where he hope it would go and crashes in to the window
71-2_1232.06_5.1.wav_ASR	it looks like it might have been the window of his next door
71-2_1237.38_1.26.wav_ASR	it could be in his phone
71-2_1238.86_0.86.wav_ASR	it's difficult to know
71-2_1239.78_7.2.wav_ASR	but it was um a window that was next to the air in which he was playing um with his soccer ball
71-2_1247.88_3.96.wav_ASR	well it hit the the glass of the window and broke it
71-2_1252.48_4.08.wav_ASR	and unfortunately there was a man that was sitting in the chair right next to the wall
71-2_1257.78_7.66.wav_ASR	and the soccer ball not only broke the window but went through completely into the um the hole
71-2_1266.32_2.88.wav_ASR	apparently they have no screens from what i'm guessing
71-2_1269.48_2.687.wav_ASR	oh it can't be responsible because we have symbols here
71-2_1272.167_11.407.wav_ASR	in the case um the ball ended up in the um in the house um in the room where the man was sitting
71-2_1284.62_3.27.wav_ASR	and he was not pleased about this
71-2_1288.15_5.76.wav_ASR	he stuck up and looked out the window to try to figure out who had broken the window
71-2_1294.2_1.43.wav_ASR	where did the bulb come from
71-2_1295.93_9.0.wav_ASR	and who is the uh person who had directed that ball towards his friend
71-2_1305.71_7.06.wav_ASR	um he's it's clearly that there's going to be some kind of um ramifications as a result of this
71-2_1313.51_3.88.wav_ASR	uh because if it's his son his son is going to be sold
71-2_1317.638_12.22.wav_ASR	and if it's a name um he's gonna expect an application and probably um some sort of paint that's been broken
71-2_1331.61_2.368.wav_ASR	so rama in the sub
71-2_1351.36_23.18.wav_ASR	well we're gonna tell we're gonna tell this story um which um is uh a play on the fact that they're apparently was uh much older fifty
71-2_1374.637_1.24.wav_ASR	it's it's very pri
71-2_1376.717_2.203.wav_ASR	ah you know the other sides
71-2_1379.217_1.12.wav_ASR	but there is the cost
71-2_1380.877_2.16.wav_ASR	um a better name is best
71-2_1383.339_19.92.wav_ASR	in any case this particular story is gonna be more in the sense that um uh mosts generally um i would say as a general um
71-2_1403.327_4.073.wav_ASR	oh anyway but in this particular case that's exactly what's happening
71-2_1407.4_17.237.wav_ASR	and and one's going on is um this child needs to take um an overview with him when he leaves
71-2_1424.637_5.175.wav_ASR	the the other is saying because sh they're getting ready for the boy to go off on his own
71-2_1430.477_1.44.wav_ASR	and the other is saying
71-2_1432.357_10.134.wav_ASR	the on what we see um uh with the clothes that are outside and s the sky and what we see on the weather reports it looks like it's gonna rain
71-2_1442.577_1.295.wav_ASR	but i think you should take an elephant
71-2_1443.872_2.02.wav_ASR	uh and a little boy is going like
71-2_1446.272_1.58.wav_ASR	yeah not taking an hour
71-2_1448.132_1.546.wav_ASR	uh i don't need one
71-2_1450.032_1.204.wav_ASR	it won't care if it name
71-2_1451.572_0.969.wav_ASR	oh not gonna make
71-2_1453.572_2.904.wav_ASR	um i'm fine on my own
71-2_1457.132_0.708.wav_ASR	oh should
71-2_1458.152_1.904.wav_ASR	oh alright you know best
71-2_1460.812_1.116.wav_ASR	you said goodbye to me
71-2_1462.212_0.403.wav_ASR	yeah
71-2_1462.615_2.1.wav_ASR	if she's still holding the amber
71-2_1465.335_0.768.wav_ASR	he hates that
71-2_1466.655_2.06.wav_ASR	and it's not just a scroll
71-2_1468.935_3.82.wav_ASR	but it really starts to oh range really hard
71-2_1472.915_1.22.wav_ASR	so it's a downpool
71-2_1475.7_2.625.wav_ASR	and um he doesn't have a
71-2_1478.655_2.945.wav_ASR	so the um range is getting inside
71-2_1481.94_2.26.wav_ASR	and he's getting really bad
71-2_1484.32_4.93.wav_ASR	it's clothes are getting drained and saturated with the water
71-2_1489.82_1.78.wav_ASR	so he gets about half a ball
71-2_1492.22_1.78.wav_ASR	and we can't even see what's going on
71-2_1494.3_3.58.wav_ASR	oh he hates back to his mother very
71-2_1499.24_0.76.wav_ASR	he looks at it now
71-2_1501.22_2.46.wav_ASR	he has the grade not to say
71-2_1503.88_0.744.wav_ASR	tell you so
71-2_1505.06_1.279.wav_ASR	because there's no rest
71-2_1506.48_1.32.wav_ASR	nei
71-2_1508.74_1.78.wav_ASR	and he stands here and looks at her
71-2_1510.86_1.98.wav_ASR	should handle some the impulse
71-2_1513.76_0.96.wav_ASR	beats
71-2_1515.14_3.02.wav_ASR	this time remembering in his brain
71-2_1519.26_3.04.wav_ASR	my brother is not always wrong about
71-2_1524.14_4.02.wav_ASR	and le but of course he forgets it by the next week when something else comes up
71-2_1528.48_7.687.wav_ASR	where we are in this week he is now um assured that his mother actually has waste which he does not yet have
71-2_1536.5_2.081.wav_ASR	oh no no no no
71-2_1555.22_3.121.wav_ASR	well speaking of ramah in the neighbourhood
71-2_1559.54_8.9.wav_ASR	um what happened here uh began because um the cat we're sitting on the porch
71-2_1569.36_3.67.wav_ASR	um the cat has the right to s uh sit on that the the
71-2_1573.78_3.17.wav_ASR	but the next door um has a dog
71-2_1576.95_6.958.wav_ASR	and the dog came out and immediately said the cat and running at the cat
71-2_1584.11_1.22.wav_ASR	and the cat is po
71-2_1586.07_5.36.wav_ASR	the cat ran from the the dog and ran up the tree because that was close
71-2_1591.15_6.0.wav_ASR	loss and that was a way to get away from the um from the dog um because the dog couldn't climb
71-2_1597.65_2.042.wav_ASR	so the cat climbed up the tree
71-2_1600.41_0.894.wav_ASR	the c. n. k.
71-2_1601.49_6.55.wav_ASR	it's a cat that's just barely uh a kitten and isn't really a constant to being that high up
71-2_1608.43_1.61.wav_ASR	um so the cat
71-2_1610.78_6.66.wav_ASR	uh the little girl ran out so her cat was up in the tree and called
71-2_1619.16_1.18.wav_ASR	cat is up in the minute
71-2_1621.04_3.96.wav_ASR	and she's out on the bar
71-2_1625.76_9.82.wav_ASR	and it doesn't look like she's pinning her way to get back out because she's miming um really loudly and clearly wants to be recorded
71-2_1636.4_1.22.wav_ASR	um so please help me
71-2_1638.16_2.86.wav_ASR	um please help me get my cat out of the tree
71-2_1641.3_3.6.wav_ASR	the phone is trying to be silvers and the curve
71-2_1645.16_4.36.wav_ASR	so he immediately goes into the graph and finds his logo
71-2_1650.2_21.487.wav_ASR	um and the blank for him was um he would simply put it inside his the laptop to the triangle
71-2_1671.68_2.39.wav_ASR	and then he could be you know the arrow
71-2_1674.76_5.62.wav_ASR	he could be um he could fulfil his deadlines
71-2_1681.42_2.26.wav_ASR	unfortunately he got up in the tree
71-2_1684.54_10.49.wav_ASR	and the ch he hadn't seriously rested the later against the tree in the way he really needed it
71-2_1695.33_1.1.wav_ASR	and it's
71-2_1697.33_4.1.wav_ASR	so now we have two people that have to be recorded from the three
71-2_1701.65_7.1.wav_ASR	we have the cat that is still meawing um loudly uh out in the far
71-2_1709.29_12.14.wav_ASR	and of course the four can't reach it because he's his weight is uh too heavy to be able to um move into those limbs without breaking them down
71-2_1721.65_1.78.wav_ASR	and then he would fall down and get hurt
71-2_1724.19_6.76.wav_ASR	so at this point the mother who knows best has called the fire department and said
71-2_1731.81_2.587.wav_ASR	it got a
71-2_1734.59_1.211.wav_ASR	but that is one she said
71-2_1735.801_6.58.wav_ASR	but that's what she thought in her brain because she doesn't want them to know about
71-2_1742.881_2.24.wav_ASR	um can you please bring
71-2_1745.553_16.023.wav_ASR	uh unfortunately we now need hell from uh firefighters to not only get the cat out of the tree but my father
71-2_1761.576_6.523.wav_ASR	and my daughter is still 'cause she's worried about the cat
71-2_1768.376_1.494.wav_ASR	and now she's waiting about a day
71-2_1770.876_2.274.wav_ASR	and the dog is still bar
71-2_1773.756_3.1.wav_ASR	is this a good idea is it she's about ready
71-2_1777.576_1.228.wav_ASR	is the power batteries are here
71-2_1779.076_1.061.wav_ASR	they're coming up
71-2_1780.05_2.35.wav_ASR	or in they're going to help the man get down further
71-2_1782.71_3.09.wav_ASR	and they're going to reach out and get the cat
71-2_1786.3_8.752.wav_ASR	uh and what the other is gonna do is she's gonna go and grab the dog and put him in the other room so that everybody will relax a bit
71-2_1796.11_3.213.wav_ASR	the everybody can make it out of the three without getting hurt
71-2_1799.323_1.586.wav_ASR	oh the green
71-2_2004.09_16.38.wav_ASR	and uh what we're essentially looking for here is in the current mobility and what the criteria is that uh women have to present in order to improve their situation in society
71-2_2021.77_1.86.wav_ASR	so we're gonna start with that
71-2_2023.99_13.24.wav_ASR	um and this is an example of the very restrictive roles that were available to women um in certain colours and certain size
71-2_2038.46_5.74.wav_ASR	um now what we're seeing here our fam a family which is completely limited
71-2_2045.26_10.16.wav_ASR	and the um in both cases what we had uh were two samples with childrens
71-2_2056.56_3.02.wav_ASR	and each of them had a space that did
71-2_2061.01_13.758.wav_ASR	the hundred had one data um who um was leaving with him
71-2_2075.16_1.256.wav_ASR	oh but his wife had died
71-2_2076.416_3.656.wav_ASR	it so he had a a young daughter who was about six years old
71-2_2080.296_11.24.wav_ASR	again in a in a r. p. in society um we'll go back to well we'll say nineteen seventy um men could not raise their own children
71-2_2091.936_1.731.wav_ASR	it had to have a a one
71-2_2093.856_0.741.wav_ASR	that was for
71-2_2094.68_3.78.wav_ASR	people were relatively ridged in terms of what they were allowed to
71-2_2099.12_3.78.wav_ASR	so he had to find a white in order to carry for his dad
71-2_2103.96_13.22.wav_ASR	um uh in a in a another part of town um we have um a man and a woman a man and a wife who had two children
71-2_2118.02_0.76.wav_ASR	and he
71-2_2119.64_8.66.wav_ASR	so the only way that she would be able to survive as a female or find another man that would marry her
71-2_2129.4_2.86.wav_ASR	so they're both out looking for another
71-2_2133.36_1.3.wav_ASR	and they meet each other
71-2_2135.0_28.16.wav_ASR	and of course what the problem is looking for the world is something that he has very restricted very different uh um we all will do all the other things that men are supposed to do in this society
71-2_2164.74_1.14.wav_ASR	so they meet each other
71-2_2166.5_3.74.wav_ASR	and he's got the impression that she's gonna be a wonderful white
71-2_2170.64_3.8.wav_ASR	um she certainly grows all over his daughter
71-2_2175.66_1.62.wav_ASR	and so they they
71-2_2177.28_12.12.wav_ASR	there are now three children
71-2_2189.86_2.76.wav_ASR	and they've no blended into this new size
71-2_2193.69_11.26.wav_ASR	uh the phone then fulfills his role which is go out and makes money for the family and leads the house uh under the management of the family
71-2_2205.31_21.673.wav_ASR	uh the steph is going to be she's going to her department and is going to treat the other departments and is going to treat the other departments and is going to treat the other steph's and is going to treat the other steph's and is going to treat the other
71-2_2227.87_6.94.wav_ASR	and for whatever reason the f folder does not interfere in what he sees when he is home
71-2_2235.41_10.02.wav_ASR	and so what we have is this this really terrible situation that exists for scenario
71-2_2245.527_4.893.wav_ASR	uh centre colour again had had a a beautiful mother who loved her
71-2_2250.667_1.201.wav_ASR	because it's close to our
71-2_2252.027_0.76.wav_ASR	if i'm not correct
71-2_2253.147_9.1.wav_ASR	now she's also in this situation where she's clearly um traded differently than her step daughters um step
71-2_2262.887_2.555.wav_ASR	semantics
71-2_2265.442_1.074.wav_ASR	apparently all the time
71-2_2267.022_0.954.wav_ASR	anybody putting on
71-2_2269.122_1.278.wav_ASR	yeah they live in society
71-2_2270.462_8.32.wav_ASR	is no way that women can um improve their s their position in this society except through memory
71-2_2279.762_2.46.wav_ASR	is the only possible option to that
71-2_2282.222_18.073.wav_ASR	and so their priority role is to learn how to manage a house um and also be attractable to the editro editro hardware
71-2_2300.295_2.36.wav_ASR	and i don't know what happens if they're not rubber
71-2_2303.295_2.211.wav_ASR	um i s i guess they just pack it
71-2_2305.815_2.972.wav_ASR	um in any case that's not part of this particular story
71-2_2309.455_1.22.wav_ASR	ah she is straight
71-2_2310.915_3.032.wav_ASR	and so that's one complication she doesn't have to deal with
71-2_2313.947_8.6.wav_ASR	and anyway on the other side of the city um at a fire place is
71-2_2323.465_20.82.wav_ASR	and well the price has essentially uh a lot of economic power and he's at the top of his current status um he's also addicted to marius um he's at the top of his role
71-2_2344.363_9.7.wav_ASR	because the plan is that he will mari and that white and that will then bear him children
71-2_2354.443_6.44.wav_ASR	and those children then means that there will be um a lightning that will continue on to the next generation
71-2_2361.383_1.861.wav_ASR	so he may not wanna get
71-2_2363.24_6.92.wav_ASR	and we don't really know what his um gesture identity is or origin
71-2_2370.56_2.72.wav_ASR	but he's he understands what his job is
71-2_2373.42_1.38.wav_ASR	he has to find a one
71-2_2375.14_1.42.wav_ASR	he has to find a part
71-2_2377.46_11.7.wav_ASR	and his plan is to find some one who's relatively attractive while he focuses the the operations of his office in his remote setup
71-2_2389.76_4.76.wav_ASR	so um the plan is he's gonna get this over with quickly
71-2_2394.609_4.6.wav_ASR	it's they're gonna have this huge dance this huge ball
71-2_2400.449_1.88.wav_ASR	the everyone in the camp
71-2_2403.749_2.623.wav_ASR	uh i'm assuming we're pretty much middle class and above
71-2_2406.669_3.7.wav_ASR	um he's not really going to the present triangle um
71-2_2410.569_1.731.wav_ASR	it's not part of this
71-2_2413.36_14.64.wav_ASR	um is inviting all of the electrical facilities who are not married um who would like to be married for him so that he can walk through and make his
71-2_2429.0_1.96.wav_ASR	again this is clearly
71-2_2432.56_5.54.wav_ASR	um it's almost like that battery shell which i've never seen and never would see
71-2_2438.84_2.588.wav_ASR	um but i certainly know a way of it
71-2_2441.428_16.26.wav_ASR	that that the million are gonna be the one that he is deciding he's going to um mate with
71-2_2458.96_11.18.wav_ASR	so anyway all three of these minutes um the two saps steps and sender uh all no that they are elderly
71-2_2470.64_6.62.wav_ASR	and they all start thinking uh about how wonderful there's the situation would be if they get
71-2_2477.759_2.965.wav_ASR	and again what's interest us we're not talking about lunch
71-2_2480.919_2.54.wav_ASR	or not talking about um you know
71-2_2485.819_3.132.wav_ASR	um we're not talking about people that are compatible with each other
71-2_2489.099_5.541.wav_ASR	we talking about they will somehow be attractive enough for this mail to choose them
71-2_2495.14_6.668.wav_ASR	and then they're light situation will improve because those are the only options that are available to them
71-2_2502.2_11.34.wav_ASR	and it's a very restrictive society and uh a certain time in in culture which is very very um limiting
71-2_2514.72_1.813.wav_ASR	so they're they're all getting ready
71-2_2516.76_1.25.wav_ASR	they know what they have to do
71-2_2518.04_0.98.wav_ASR	they have to look at a triangle
71-2_2519.46_1.52.wav_ASR	so they have to have a really nice draw
71-2_2521.32_1.34.wav_ASR	there he is to be fixed up
71-2_2522.8_14.67.wav_ASR	and um they have to somehow make them stand out from the others and order into
71-2_2538.05_7.3.wav_ASR	so um because the stamp is her own daughters is she holds out whatever money they have a belt
71-2_2545.61_13.82.wav_ASR	and she gets them the the the fanciest dresses that you could possibly choose and you know with uh hair dresses and they're make up and everything else to get them as cute as possible
71-2_2560.48_2.99.wav_ASR	standard uh
71-2_2563.97_8.22.wav_ASR	so she pulls out um uh a book that she got from her mother which has patterns of dresses
71-2_2572.57_8.51.wav_ASR	because she's very smart and very creative and because she's had to do a lot of the manual work in the house she knows how to solve
71-2_2581.9_5.18.wav_ASR	so she pulls together some um scrap of material that are available to
71-2_2587.26_3.6.wav_ASR	should put together this really
71-2_2591.12_1.64.wav_ASR	and it's kinda off the shoulder
71-2_2593.16_3.109.wav_ASR	yeah it's kinda pink uh which kinda plays up our hair
71-2_2597.18_1.602.wav_ASR	and um she's ready to go
71-2_2599.24_1.68.wav_ASR	she's doing the best that she
71-2_2600.92_1.16.wav_ASR	yeah that's what she has a bad
71-2_2602.7_0.86.wav_ASR	and she's ready
71-2_2603.98_2.02.wav_ASR	of course for m
71-2_2606.3_1.06.wav_ASR	or no circuit design
71-2_2609.46_2.94.wav_ASR	you are not of our
71-2_2612.88_1.4.wav_ASR	you are of a present
71-2_2615.14_2.22.wav_ASR	you you don't have the right clothes for it
71-2_2617.64_1.2.wav_ASR	you want rest correct
71-2_2619.54_0.74.wav_ASR	you are not gonna
71-2_2620.5_1.42.wav_ASR	my daughters are going
71-2_2622.98_4.02.wav_ASR	the the stepsisters of course have got their curve from their thumb
71-2_2627.22_1.94.wav_ASR	they know it'll be really really cool to
71-2_2629.38_1.02.wav_ASR	oh they're flat at her
71-2_2631.4_4.92.wav_ASR	and she goes out on the barn um to take care of the animals because that's kind of our product
71-2_2636.32_4.32.wav_ASR	so that's the place where she can go and get some kind of action from the other end
71-2_2641.04_0.764.wav_ASR	that's on the f
71-2_2642.1_1.3.wav_ASR	yeah she's
71-2_2644.4_2.137.wav_ASR	and she's waiting her dress and her
71-2_2647.06_1.593.wav_ASR	or she doesn't know what she's gonna do
71-2_2648.78_0.6.wav_ASR	is she
71-2_2649.62_7.806.wav_ASR	uh what can she possibly do what can she possibly do to some how get out of the miserable situation that she's in
71-2_2657.46_8.42.wav_ASR	and this very godmother appears to her um because she's the you know a wonderful person
71-2_2666.1_1.27.wav_ASR	just giving to other people
71-2_2667.6_1.24.wav_ASR	should deserves it
71-2_2669.7_4.22.wav_ASR	so this pretty godmother shows up and says
71-2_2674.82_0.58.wav_ASR	are you cool
71-2_2675.52_0.52.wav_ASR	what's
71-2_2676.1_0.7.wav_ASR	what do you mean
71-2_2677.62_0.66.wav_ASR	and she said
71-2_2678.52_2.04.wav_ASR	ah would like to go to the the ball
71-2_2680.9_1.26.wav_ASR	but i want to
71-2_2682.56_1.04.wav_ASR	don't want to be flat that
71-2_2683.76_3.48.wav_ASR	uh wanna have the appropriate clothes that i i
71-2_2687.6_1.84.wav_ASR	oh it'll be destroyed well like everyone
71-2_2689.8_7.06.wav_ASR	and i want to be have the same options that my subjects have
71-2_2697.8_0.58.wav_ASR	so she
71-2_2699.7_0.6.wav_ASR	it
71-2_2700.72_5.86.wav_ASR	and she you know use her uh uses her for his abilities and s
71-2_2707.42_0.56.wav_ASR	he looks
71-2_2708.52_7.98.wav_ASR	and she transforms the rats into horns that will be pulling um a carrot
71-2_2716.86_3.12.wav_ASR	and the core charge is transferred from a pump
71-2_2721.2_4.98.wav_ASR	and she uses her own and and goes over celsius
71-2_2726.24_11.79.wav_ASR	oops and all of a sudden she's waiting these um outdated uh expensive dubious
71-2_2738.29_8.18.wav_ASR	for hair is is uh made up um and uh the the latest
71-2_2747.67_2.25.wav_ASR	um she's got beautiful make up on
71-2_2750.27_1.14.wav_ASR	oh she looks gorgeous
71-2_2752.87_4.26.wav_ASR	for better godmother says to her
71-2_2758.27_1.606.wav_ASR	go to the board
71-2_2759.97_1.155.wav_ASR	you deserve this
71-2_2761.59_3.96.wav_ASR	uh please understand that this illustration will only last till
71-2_2766.17_5.725.wav_ASR	it at the middle the horns will be transformed back into a r
71-2_2772.51_4.809.wav_ASR	the the arrangement will be transferred back into a pump can
71-2_2778.35_9.98.wav_ASR	and the rags that you're wearing will or the fancy black dress that you're wearing will be transformed back into
71-2_2789.37_2.005.wav_ASR	so please go
71-2_2791.95_0.762.wav_ASR	oh
71-2_2792.712_5.46.wav_ASR	and but recognise this is just a moment out of your existence
71-2_2798.512_7.04.wav_ASR	this is a special bulb that um that is that that is hitting your your existing
71-2_2805.892_1.758.wav_ASR	oh it's not really gonna change a thing
71-2_2808.012_1.558.wav_ASR	please ignore your problem
71-2_2810.63_3.14.wav_ASR	oh she hugs the very god
71-2_2814.41_1.88.wav_ASR	he gets in the colour
71-2_2817.21_2.2.wav_ASR	it's taken to that
71-2_2820.33_0.36.wav_ASR	yeah
71-2_2821.17_8.52.wav_ASR	even for steps don't know who this one is because she's dressed so magically that she stands out
71-2_2830.55_10.16.wav_ASR	um all they all all the other people that are watching all they can think of is she must be from a really rich
71-2_2842.35_1.34.wav_ASR	and we don't know if
71-2_2843.97_3.16.wav_ASR	she must be from a very high social stat
71-2_2847.65_1.71.wav_ASR	and she's clearly very beautiful
71-2_2849.56_5.5.wav_ASR	and i mean the fact that they don't even recognise their own stepister is pretty tall
71-2_2855.87_1.702.wav_ASR	in any case she walks in
71-2_2858.34_8.7.wav_ASR	uh print is immediately in his adaptation yeah format sees her and says
71-2_2867.361_0.856.wav_ASR	it's the stand up
71-2_2868.82_1.51.wav_ASR	she's the she's the one
71-2_2870.72_1.77.wav_ASR	um and he adds over to word
71-2_2872.76_1.61.wav_ASR	it immediately looks at
71-2_2874.58_5.47.wav_ASR	he says that she's also beautiful on top of being well e uh clearly wealthy and well dressed
71-2_2880.91_1.45.wav_ASR	um she's also great
71-2_2882.78_0.91.wav_ASR	it's a wonderful land
71-2_2884.34_0.31.wav_ASR	or
71-2_2885.36_1.74.wav_ASR	there's an automatic
71-2_2887.88_2.89.wav_ASR	and there's there's there's camera between
71-2_2891.62_0.875.wav_ASR	and he said
71-2_2893.18_1.008.wav_ASR	is thinking in his mind
71-2_2894.42_1.321.wav_ASR	that was gonna be oh
71-2_2896.04_2.52.wav_ASR	it thought this was gonna be a d. a. a.
71-2_2898.78_2.795.wav_ASR	but i really like her
71-2_2902.0_1.34.wav_ASR	oh this is this is
71-2_2903.86_2.26.wav_ASR	it's hopping for something this man
71-2_2906.281_1.956.wav_ASR	uh i was prepared for something else
71-2_2908.461_1.931.wav_ASR	this this can this can work
71-2_2910.761_2.955.wav_ASR	so he wants to spend time with her as much as he can
71-2_2913.941_0.479.wav_ASR	oh that's it
71-2_2914.681_0.98.wav_ASR	she's into it too
71-2_2915.801_1.52.wav_ASR	uh mean they're they're really connected
71-2_2917.761_1.52.wav_ASR	it's just this one
71-2_2920.001_4.289.wav_ASR	and then she looks up at the clock and sees that it is five minutes to a minute
71-2_2926.49_28.8.wav_ASR	and she knows because of this plethora um that she's really not this well in his dilemma um that he's really going
71-2_2956.938_4.418.wav_ASR	he she knows that the elimination will also be gone
71-2_2961.538_9.22.wav_ASR	he she's pretty sure that what he really wanted is the the the trapping the appearances uh all the stuff that goes along with well
71-2_2971.438_5.015.wav_ASR	oh she knows it's that as soon as he sees this who should really is um it's gonna be over
71-2_2976.453_4.78.wav_ASR	so she rains as away as quickly as she can because she wants to get away she
71-2_2981.093_8.34.wav_ASR	he doesn't wanna see the look in his eyes when he sees who she really is and how she's really dressed
71-2_2990.23_2.14.wav_ASR	so he's he doesn't understand what happened
71-2_2992.653_0.437.wav_ASR	here's he
71-2_2993.173_0.717.wav_ASR	what did he say
71-2_2994.053_1.277.wav_ASR	did you say something to a f
71-2_2995.46_1.51.wav_ASR	there is she
71-2_2997.36_6.02.wav_ASR	and she replaces anyway as quickly as she can so quickly that she drops on her shoe
71-2_3003.6_0.62.wav_ASR	sh
71-2_3004.74_1.712.wav_ASR	and um his shoe falls up
71-2_3006.6_1.342.wav_ASR	she doesn't have time to grab it
71-2_3008.32_0.93.wav_ASR	she's gotta get going
71-2_3009.56_0.89.wav_ASR	she's gonna get away
71-2_3010.96_1.49.wav_ASR	so she makes it around the corner
71-2_3012.45_3.64.wav_ASR	and immediately it happens
71-2_3016.65_9.027.wav_ASR	the but the wall desk um is transformed back into our legs
71-2_3025.677_7.746.wav_ASR	the the penguin luckily she didn't get in it because i don't know what would have been a pity if she were actually inside the penguin
71-2_3033.917_1.461.wav_ASR	um
71-2_3035.637_0.493.wav_ASR	the pop
71-2_3036.697_2.343.wav_ASR	the f the f the costs are gone
71-2_3039.7_1.22.wav_ASR	oh they're rats again
71-2_3041.9_5.82.wav_ASR	so she walks home screams in the back because yeah they don't really care what she's doing
71-2_3047.96_2.44.wav_ASR	it could be out in the j the bar or whatever
71-2_3051.18_1.98.wav_ASR	and she remembers her
71-2_3053.64_0.44.wav_ASR	sh
71-2_3054.52_2.96.wav_ASR	uh i got to see what it was like to be on the other side of it
71-2_3058.28_1.562.wav_ASR	oh maybe i can be content
71-2_3059.842_2.694.wav_ASR	or maybe there's some other way that i can get out of here
71-2_3062.542_1.178.wav_ASR	at least i had
71-2_3064.362_9.62.wav_ASR	at least i know that if i had the appropriate clothes um i could i could walk into a society at that level and i could
71-2_3075.322_2.431.wav_ASR	mean time he's back in the palace
71-2_3078.142_1.402.wav_ASR	um he's chasing after
71-2_3079.8_11.914.wav_ASR	it's you know kind of uh th this one is that all these women are throwing himself at um but i'm this one is playing hard to get because she's
71-2_3092.42_1.26.wav_ASR	so there's kind of a mixture
71-2_3093.8_0.92.wav_ASR	let's stop the show
71-2_3095.48_0.44.wav_ASR	if we sell
71-2_3096.62_2.419.wav_ASR	uh i want that one
71-2_3099.039_1.554.wav_ASR	and we set that to his phone
71-2_3101.459_0.874.wav_ASR	uh i will get married
71-2_3102.659_1.457.wav_ASR	but do everything you want me to do
71-2_3104.319_1.26.wav_ASR	oh fulfil my obligations
71-2_3106.019_2.317.wav_ASR	but i'm only gonna matter a one i wanna be with
71-2_3108.479_1.188.wav_ASR	and i decided to do it
71-2_3109.899_0.481.wav_ASR	it's
71-2_3110.579_0.492.wav_ASR	the print
71-2_3111.559_1.82.wav_ASR	the mister
71-2_3113.739_1.359.wav_ASR	um and i got a sheet
71-2_3115.098_9.104.wav_ASR	so all i have to do now is go around and see if i can figure out who's fit who'll fit into that shoe
71-2_3124.478_2.226.wav_ASR	and then that will be the person
71-2_3126.704_14.559.wav_ASR	um uh because he's beginning to understand in his mind that there are some limitations of this society which trend signs and how much money they make
71-2_3141.263_17.44.wav_ASR	and he's beginning to think if the their their souls that um it could just be so they could just be some of what their initial position in society was
71-2_3158.75_4.86.wav_ASR	so he's thinking at this point he's thinking much more broadly than his father is
71-2_3163.91_2.82.wav_ASR	and so they got this this this bar
71-2_3167.87_7.62.wav_ASR	if he can find a one who's feet into those glasses he will know who that person is
71-2_3175.61_0.918.wav_ASR	and a little look at it
71-2_3176.528_4.36.wav_ASR	and he'll be able to know that that's the person that his is true
71-2_3181.928_1.599.wav_ASR	that's the person that he will win
71-2_3184.23_8.169.wav_ASR	and because the way society works is if you're rich you can marry down but if you're uh but but it has to be their choice
71-2_3192.59_7.512.wav_ASR	if you're poor and you wanna marry um you're gonna be viewable as some kind of solar clamber
71-2_3200.21_5.812.wav_ASR	so you pretty much need um someone rich to reach down in some way
71-2_3207.09_0.38.wav_ASR	oh
71-2_3208.27_0.924.wav_ASR	he's male
71-2_3209.37_0.56.wav_ASR	champagne
71-2_3210.23_5.02.wav_ASR	and given the practical limitations of them she doesn't get to ask him
71-2_3215.67_1.58.wav_ASR	he has to ask her
71-2_3217.53_2.64.wav_ASR	and this is this goes back two hundred years
71-2_3220.23_10.62.wav_ASR	and this is the way um in which um in terms of what people could actually do
71-2_3232.95_1.66.wav_ASR	oh um he's going around
71-2_3234.63_9.058.wav_ASR	and of course this is clearly a really instant way to find the partner that he's actually looking for the mystery one who got away
71-2_3244.37_1.53.wav_ASR	but he's no else what to do
71-2_3246.27_1.395.wav_ASR	and you say it's arbitrary
71-2_3248.05_0.952.wav_ASR	it's the one i want
71-2_3249.19_4.215.wav_ASR	um who saw the one you know with uh the great carrot
71-2_3253.405_1.7.wav_ASR	and you just call this
71-2_3255.445_1.264.wav_ASR	everybody is looking for
71-2_3256.825_0.684.wav_ASR	they can't find
71-2_3258.025_3.705.wav_ASR	so we're gonna start with the the show because he's got something in front of him
71-2_3262.625_10.345.wav_ASR	and they advertise that he will be going city to city to see if women would come forward um to see if you can find the one that will fit the room
71-2_3273.59_2.54.wav_ASR	so of course the steps
71-2_3276.77_4.492.wav_ASR	he he passes us by um the night of the ball
71-2_3281.67_5.34.wav_ASR	but all we gotta do is get our feet is get our feet to fit into that shoe
71-2_3287.15_7.66.wav_ASR	and of course they're looking at this in a really superficial kind of way because he knows that as soon as he finds the right one
71-2_3298.01_6.16.wav_ASR	um and clearly even if those shoes did fit the step dancers it wouldn't matter
71-2_3304.47_1.08.wav_ASR	the v. no
71-2_3305.92_1.24.wav_ASR	chick there be no caps
71-2_3307.5_1.43.wav_ASR	but you know they don't understand that
71-2_3309.14_4.5.wav_ASR	are really uh behind in terms of understanding human relationship
71-2_3314.91_9.46.wav_ASR	oh scenario is she knows if she has the opportunity to connect with him again he can take her out of the situation that she's uh
71-2_3324.63_1.94.wav_ASR	and they did not connect
71-2_3326.99_0.66.wav_ASR	they should not
71-2_3327.87_0.666.wav_ASR	but they did
71-2_3328.77_1.6.wav_ASR	um it was very imp
71-2_3331.15_16.88.wav_ASR	but for whatever reason because of the the the process has been given that opportunity to step out of her role and move into a um uh the process level
71-2_3349.85_4.94.wav_ASR	so when they come up to the house both of the step daughters go
71-2_3355.33_3.9.wav_ASR	may try very hard to see if their feet will fit into the shoe
71-2_3359.65_1.118.wav_ASR	and they they don't
71-2_3361.07_2.251.wav_ASR	doing everything that he can
71-2_3363.39_2.46.wav_ASR	is this point the price is just very discrete
71-2_3366.67_1.663.wav_ASR	it doesn't think he's ever gonna find either again
71-2_3368.45_4.78.wav_ASR	and he'll be stuck with somebody else that his father will probably arrange for him
71-2_3374.21_1.02.wav_ASR	and he finally said
71-2_3375.45_9.07.wav_ASR	there are any other woman in this house who could possibly be able to deal with this
71-2_3385.34_2.26.wav_ASR	and solar cells
71-2_3388.1_5.46.wav_ASR	and this is the brightest thing she's ever done because for stepmother is just gonna punish her for this after
71-2_3394.22_0.66.wav_ASR	and she said
71-2_3395.354_0.61.wav_ASR	and here
71-2_3396.64_1.68.wav_ASR	the stapler turns and looks at
71-2_3398.32_11.3.wav_ASR	for and she's ready to you know clearly to punish her and and um prevent her not to eat for a while and really really make her life miserable
71-2_3410.66_4.26.wav_ASR	um but the person that's working with the print said
71-2_3415.8_1.04.wav_ASR	he said everybody
71-2_3417.006_1.52.wav_ASR	oh no oh no
71-2_3419.206_5.75.wav_ASR	and she steps forward dispute the fact that she's being glare at by the friendly member
71-2_3426.49_1.26.wav_ASR	and she sits down
71-2_3428.266_4.56.wav_ASR	and for what bits the shell
71-2_3433.786_1.224.wav_ASR	the print looks at her
71-2_3435.486_0.884.wav_ASR	her eyes meet
71-2_3437.19_5.92.wav_ASR	and once again he knows he's he's met his
71-2_3444.51_11.84.wav_ASR	and at that point all of the power that the print has um to be able to protect her from her stomach is kind of and form
71-2_3457.31_6.494.wav_ASR	um all of our beautiful clothes come back though we're beginning to think this might have been an issue in the first place
71-2_3465.03_1.22.wav_ASR	the steph is said
71-2_3467.17_0.966.wav_ASR	it's out of my hand
71-2_3468.27_3.048.wav_ASR	and i have no ability to punish her anymore
71-2_3471.91_15.74.wav_ASR	and the print's all out and uh brings her back to the colours um which she will be uh a group higher status than she um has been lit
71-2_3488.11_2.18.wav_ASR	that's gonna have to learn how to uh man
71-2_3490.38_2.51.wav_ASR	or she's gonna have learn how to talk
71-2_3493.22_6.463.wav_ASR	she's gonna have to learn um how to connect herself as a layout
71-2_3500.06_5.22.wav_ASR	all the things that are associated associated with a higher social class
71-2_3505.28_7.11.wav_ASR	um but because they connect at a human level um this is gonna work
71-2_3569.68_4.16.wav_ASR	that's just thinking about telling you about the one i told you last
71-2_3574.16_1.744.wav_ASR	so i have to come up with a new one and that
71-2_3575.904_16.746.wav_ASR	um when i was in the third grade which means i was about eight with being able to read a class
71-2_3594.17_4.66.wav_ASR	but there were some details that i was not completely clear about
71-2_3599.49_5.1.wav_ASR	one of those is what is a quarter after on a clock
71-2_3606.01_7.8.wav_ASR	um i mean i certainly knew that the shorter hand or hand was the owl
71-2_3614.27_3.18.wav_ASR	and the long handheld was the mini
71-2_3618.41_10.9.wav_ASR	um but for my in my in my eighty nine from my in my eighty nine from my corner after someone said twenty five after or a quarter after it met twenty
71-2_3629.95_0.94.wav_ASR	didn't mean fifteen
71-2_3632.237_7.116.wav_ASR	and what it happened is my older sister was had stayed home sick that day
71-2_3640.43_4.54.wav_ASR	and i was supposed to go to her elementary school teach
71-2_3645.277_2.053.wav_ASR	she was in the fifty grade
71-2_3647.95_6.86.wav_ASR	and i was supposed to get her home and bring it home to her so that she could do a work and she could bring it in the next day
71-2_3655.69_1.8.wav_ASR	so i want to my teacher and so
71-2_3657.81_4.4.wav_ASR	it's supposed to go to um mister
71-2_3662.55_3.64.wav_ASR	and i'm supposed to pick up my sisters home
71-2_3667.09_0.66.wav_ASR	and she said
71-2_3668.13_1.372.wav_ASR	why not you go at copyright after
71-2_3669.502_1.648.wav_ASR	so i said
71-2_3671.37_0.632.wav_ASR	yeah i will
71-2_3672.79_7.687.wav_ASR	ah i thought quarter after was twenty five minutes after because it's in my mind that's what i made sense
71-2_3680.63_1.36.wav_ASR	the colour is twenty five min
71-2_3682.55_2.16.wav_ASR	it's a quarter is for twenty five cents
71-2_3685.29_6.464.wav_ASR	so colour after would be three twenty five not three fifteen which is what she's saying
71-2_3691.83_1.241.wav_ASR	cover after the hour
71-2_3693.83_6.8.wav_ASR	so i waited till three twenty five which is five minutes before the school is is closed
71-2_3701.57_3.218.wav_ASR	it's way too late for me to be going and doing that i'm supposed to be doing in
71-2_3704.71_1.76.wav_ASR	uh i was supposed to done it ten minutes earlier
71-2_3706.77_5.92.wav_ASR	and i'm watching the clock until exactly three twenty five and getting up and going to doing what i'm supposed to do
71-2_3713.17_1.54.wav_ASR	and i ran off
71-2_3715.13_4.3.wav_ASR	of course it's a mass because i'm missing the end of my class
71-2_3720.41_4.7.wav_ASR	um my class this is feasters class is closing down
71-2_3726.15_4.02.wav_ASR	so i get back to my class probably at three thirty five
71-2_3730.99_3.236.wav_ASR	my teacher is still waiting there because my stop is still in the dust
71-2_3734.91_1.24.wav_ASR	did you wait so long
71-2_3736.33_0.6.wav_ASR	yeah she's
71-2_3737.07_2.17.wav_ASR	it went exactly when you told me to go
71-2_3739.78_1.66.wav_ASR	you told me to go to
71-2_3742.38_0.58.wav_ASR	and she said
71-2_3743.24_2.52.wav_ASR	oh you didn't go till three twenty five
71-2_3746.02_0.42.wav_ASR	let's see
71-2_3746.78_1.46.wav_ASR	but isn't that
71-2_3749.18_19.93.wav_ASR	and so at the age of eight i understood finally that when a doubt is said after an hour and they're not twenty five minutes after an hour and a half
71-2_3769.95_0.381.wav_ASR	oh s
71-2_3770.47_0.576.wav_ASR	it's i don't know
71-2_3783.83_0.927.wav_ASR	yeah well to me
71-2_3784.77_0.667.wav_ASR	uh i was a
71-2_3785.65_0.876.wav_ASR	it's
71-2_3786.87_2.118.wav_ASR	sh yeah you know a quarter after the hour
71-2_3788.988_1.9.wav_ASR	or
71-2_3791.248_1.687.wav_ASR	they just won't clear about it
71-2_3793.668_2.282.wav_ASR	now that i actually talk back
71-2_3796.328_1.262.wav_ASR	you know i was in a coma
71-2_3797.748_1.362.wav_ASR	you never talk back to any
71-2_3799.368_1.8.wav_ASR	but i'm just really confused
71-2_3809.35_6.62.wav_ASR	um i think a good bird
71-2_3816.149_18.351.wav_ASR	um i think to talk about this story i think i'm going to talk about one i learned how to write the word because at the time when i did it i was asked if i could bake the bird
71-2_3836.08_11.38.wav_ASR	and of course um growing up in an extended family in which we had very very huge things i never made in my own thoughts
71-2_3847.78_2.32.wav_ASR	uh generally we would go to my grandmother's house
71-2_3850.98_1.12.wav_ASR	and she had a little child
71-2_3852.94_2.427.wav_ASR	so um our job
71-2_3855.367_3.059.wav_ASR	but my father was the second oldest of that family
71-2_3859.04_2.22.wav_ASR	our job was to bring some pies
71-2_3861.92_7.327.wav_ASR	and usually we would bring something else but it would be canvas or something else uh red some
71-2_3869.707_2.393.wav_ASR	uh we never made the tur
71-2_3872.607_2.173.wav_ASR	you're never responsive for doing any of it
71-2_3874.78_1.654.wav_ASR	it um then we sh
71-2_3876.434_0.914.wav_ASR	it'd be quite a f
71-2_3877.82_5.48.wav_ASR	you know i'd hang up with my in the kitchen with the window because they were kind of restricted that
71-2_3883.46_1.96.wav_ASR	the menu will be in the living room watching fruit bowl
71-2_3886.28_4.902.wav_ASR	and yeah you would just try to deal with those um goals
71-2_3891.42_2.44.wav_ASR	but anyway i was by myself
71-2_3893.937_6.46.wav_ASR	oh i was um i was i was a senior in
71-2_3903.017_2.6.wav_ASR	the i was working as a waiter
71-2_3906.217_1.753.wav_ASR	the i didn't i didn't have a car
71-2_3909.03_2.46.wav_ASR	and i couldn't get enough time off from work
71-2_3911.917_1.736.wav_ASR	it didn't have enough security there
71-2_3913.653_4.9.wav_ASR	so for whatever reason i had to work on windows before things
71-2_3919.253_1.48.wav_ASR	and i was gonna be design
71-2_3920.873_2.933.wav_ASR	that's gonna miss this big funny uh absent
71-2_3924.413_4.96.wav_ASR	but i decided that i was still going to make sure that i had the trapping
71-2_3929.773_1.74.wav_ASR	but i still had
71-2_3931.715_1.84.wav_ASR	but i still had
71-2_3934.135_1.48.wav_ASR	that i still had
71-2_3935.995_1.437.wav_ASR	but those are the things i like anyway
71-2_3937.995_2.438.wav_ASR	so i'm gonna go through this 'cause now i'm an adult right
71-2_3940.455_1.144.wav_ASR	and i know how to do all that
71-2_3941.995_1.475.wav_ASR	why shouldn't i be able to do
71-2_3943.535_0.973.wav_ASR	it can't be hard
71-2_3945.135_1.145.wav_ASR	it comes out the other
71-2_3946.495_1.92.wav_ASR	it looks like you turn that of an oh
71-2_3948.615_1.065.wav_ASR	you put the
71-2_3949.895_1.065.wav_ASR	you leave it in for a long
71-2_3951.06_1.38.wav_ASR	and especially you pull it
71-2_3952.98_1.427.wav_ASR	then you
71-2_3954.407_0.765.wav_ASR	it can do that
71-2_3956.5_5.3.wav_ASR	um the two day before thank giving after i'm called
71-2_3962.12_0.88.wav_ASR	and everyone's saying
71-2_3963.12_1.013.wav_ASR	or not gonna be here
71-2_3964.3_1.612.wav_ASR	uh can't believe you're not gonna be
71-2_3965.912_1.841.wav_ASR	and feeling all described in all this
71-2_3967.94_2.64.wav_ASR	but i get how i pick up this
71-2_3970.948_2.557.wav_ASR	and i don't get a particularly big one
71-2_3973.708_0.995.wav_ASR	it's pretty big
71-2_3974.748_3.832.wav_ASR	probably like twenty pounds which is certainly more than i mean
71-2_3979.388_1.599.wav_ASR	um but you know i don't know
71-2_3981.128_5.18.wav_ASR	smaller than the ones that my family has ever used for things
71-2_3986.648_1.44.wav_ASR	so i pick up this
71-2_3989.32_4.94.wav_ASR	um after i got home for work on Wednesday i pulled it out of the fridge
71-2_3994.86_1.6.wav_ASR	yeah kinda see what i'm going here with that
71-2_3997.14_1.16.wav_ASR	um
71-2_3998.92_0.655.wav_ASR	and save
71-2_3999.94_8.707.wav_ASR	uh i think i probably if i put it in the morning on the morning um i should be able to eat probably like four o'clock in the afternoon
71-2_4008.6_3.427.wav_ASR	yeah and you know i already know how to make pies and all the other stuff
71-2_4012.36_2.28.wav_ASR	oh i stick it in the oh
71-2_4015.16_2.54.wav_ASR	uh put tin foil over it
71-2_4018.12_1.74.wav_ASR	it got the temperature curve
71-2_4020.98_0.76.wav_ASR	uh put it in
71-2_4022.48_2.3.wav_ASR	and you know in the meantime i'm getting really hungry
71-2_4025.22_1.08.wav_ASR	yeah the day is going
71-2_4026.96_2.58.wav_ASR	the other smells really good
71-2_4030.16_1.799.wav_ASR	um i'm already got the price that
71-2_4032.82_2.322.wav_ASR	so i thought the price 'cause i need time to bake 'em
71-2_4035.7_1.44.wav_ASR	um i got it
71-2_4037.36_0.82.wav_ASR	and i'm watching t.
71-2_4038.6_1.326.wav_ASR	and so it's about four
71-2_4040.14_5.623.wav_ASR	uh divided my next door neighbour to come over and help exchanging with me sharing with me
71-2_4045.6_2.7.wav_ASR	me and i poured out the oil
71-2_4048.88_8.18.wav_ASR	uh i pou i opened the other door pull out the the the turkey and take off the tin
71-2_4058.22_5.156.wav_ASR	and all this is it's still kind of ro on the top
71-2_4063.76_1.56.wav_ASR	um it's
71-2_4065.473_3.02.wav_ASR	in what apparently i didn't understand you had to fall them
71-2_4068.773_3.506.wav_ASR	uh i did not know that they're actually a process that yeah
71-2_4072.673_10.555.wav_ASR	so um what i have is a turtle which is overcook on the bottom completely on the top part of it
71-2_4083.413_1.1.wav_ASR	it's bl
71-2_4084.791_4.6.wav_ASR	or you don't need you know when you wake it you s yeah
71-2_4089.731_1.877.wav_ASR	um having blood coming out of it
71-2_4092.3_1.672.wav_ASR	so i got my next job so
71-2_4094.631_1.127.wav_ASR	so why not we gonna eat
71-2_4095.771_0.429.wav_ASR	it's
71-2_4096.271_1.769.wav_ASR	well it looks like it's not done yet
71-2_4098.231_1.569.wav_ASR	oh no why it's taking this long
71-2_4101.011_1.629.wav_ASR	it um i don't see
71-2_4103.091_0.989.wav_ASR	let's just see the price
71-2_4104.66_1.34.wav_ASR	so i put it back in the up
71-2_4106.3_0.82.wav_ASR	we eat the pa
71-2_4107.6_2.94.wav_ASR	um we start eating yeah whatever i got in the house
71-2_4110.92_3.32.wav_ASR	and keep opening the other door and channel yeah
71-2_4114.46_1.1.wav_ASR	oh no
71-2_4115.9_3.62.wav_ASR	oh and finally at this point my next step
71-2_4119.66_2.687.wav_ASR	oh i'm not really hungry anymore because we haven't eat
71-2_4122.347_5.32.wav_ASR	and i think i had some mango and cheese in the um uh refrigerator
71-2_4127.947_0.653.wav_ASR	we didn't
71-2_4128.987_0.853.wav_ASR	you already had the
71-2_4130.887_1.513.wav_ASR	um you know we're e editing other stuff
71-2_4132.587_2.053.wav_ASR	think we're trick and beer pretty much at that point
71-2_4135.127_1.673.wav_ASR	and it's still just isn't
71-2_4136.987_0.32.wav_ASR	let's see
71-2_4137.427_1.789.wav_ASR	think there's something wrong with my pen
71-2_4139.216_4.64.wav_ASR	for whatever reason this bird did not look
71-2_4144.716_6.64.wav_ASR	so basically um i finally took it out of the olive
71-2_4152.1_1.576.wav_ASR	um it was half coke
71-2_4154.1_6.54.wav_ASR	and then i found out the next day from my ant that it was supposed to be thought probably three or four days an end
71-2_4161.66_3.14.wav_ASR	um that's the only way that it's cut even
71-2_4164.8_10.968.wav_ASR	and i never told anybody other than my ant that the reason that my roommate did not work out is not because i forgot the thought
71-2_4175.98_2.66.wav_ASR	uh because i told the the other just didn't work
71-2_4178.98_0.94.wav_ASR	yeah that's the
71-2_4180.26_1.499.wav_ASR	that's the only one i want with right
71-2_4181.86_0.46.wav_ASR	it did not
71-2_4182.62_1.64.wav_ASR	they would have laughed at me for ever
71-2_4184.269_5.704.wav_ASR	are they're ridiculed me for not knowing something as basic as that
71-2_4190.749_3.091.wav_ASR	but it's the first um bird i ever tried to
71-2_4194.709_2.56.wav_ASR	there's there's you need to tell you the details
71-2_4197.749_2.931.wav_ASR	but there's more import than just stick it in the in the up
71-2_4201.309_1.4.wav_ASR	oh anyway yeah
71-2_4202.869_1.276.wav_ASR	oh i th
71-2_4204.145_0.66.wav_ASR	but i didn't take
71-2_4205.385_11.22.wav_ASR	the next was actually inside paper and it's stuck inside
71-2_4217.465_4.355.wav_ASR	when i finally was able to get it out i had paper in there too on top
71-2_4222.245_1.467.wav_ASR	but
71-2_4223.712_2.033.wav_ASR	so apparently i ate it oh
71-2_4225.772_5.36.wav_ASR	um i just hacked it up and kind of cut it
71-2_4231.613_1.392.wav_ASR	it's but
71-2_4244.36_0.39.wav_ASR	oops
71-2_4246.12_3.22.wav_ASR	um oh okay
71-2_4250.31_12.91.wav_ASR	um going to talk about uh a lot that i stayed in when i was living in cupcake and um and was travelling with five other people
71-2_4263.273_6.26.wav_ASR	now in this particular case uh what it happened is we were on christmas break
71-2_4270.133_3.68.wav_ASR	so we had a month off in which they're no class
71-2_4274.793_1.429.wav_ASR	and so all of that
71-2_4276.413_2.08.wav_ASR	we're about twenty five of us there
71-2_4278.663_5.439.wav_ASR	we were between the ages of ninety and twenty one and we were in europe
71-2_4284.483_8.28.wav_ASR	and we have the ability to be able to buy new labels uh which means unlimited traps
71-2_4293.323_0.72.wav_ASR	your basic
71-2_4294.543_3.437.wav_ASR	uh i can't remember what it costs at this point
71-2_4297.98_2.54.wav_ASR	but i think it was about a hundred dollars you paid
71-2_4300.82_16.44.wav_ASR	you could otherwise go anyway um anyway as far as um as far as it was on this um this role
71-2_4317.626_3.34.wav_ASR	so yeah we had all these ways of trying to do it cheap
71-2_4321.286_2.024.wav_ASR	oh we'll sleep on on train
71-2_4323.546_4.404.wav_ASR	we would take things at night so that we wouldn't have to worry about a
71-2_4328.866_1.9.wav_ASR	but um we're now
71-2_4331.086_2.44.wav_ASR	we're several of us that were travelling
71-2_4333.686_1.58.wav_ASR	that's with a friend called captcha
71-2_4335.298_4.36.wav_ASR	and we were connecting in with sample and cover
71-2_4339.721_2.975.wav_ASR	and um and we were they were coming
71-2_4342.838_1.313.wav_ASR	you're trapped from somewhere else
71-2_4344.198_2.045.wav_ASR	we're all gonna meet together in room
71-2_4346.718_4.949.wav_ASR	and we figured we would all stay in a hotel together um to save money you know
71-2_4351.738_2.52.wav_ASR	we will have i think two b
71-2_4354.57_1.472.wav_ASR	so um so there is a cat
71-2_4356.47_1.518.wav_ASR	uh one of us would sleep with a cat
71-2_4357.988_3.735.wav_ASR	and and two women would be in the other the other bat
71-2_4362.65_1.8.wav_ASR	so it's new user e
71-2_4364.61_1.672.wav_ASR	um because this is Christmas break
71-2_4366.73_2.06.wav_ASR	we arrive in
71-2_4369.51_2.46.wav_ASR	and the first thing we m we would do when
71-2_4372.105_3.44.wav_ASR	and we're gonna c meet with each other at the training station
71-2_4376.45_1.74.wav_ASR	um we all met at the training station
71-2_4378.485_2.025.wav_ASR	we all got in with an half an hour of each other's
71-2_4380.725_0.585.wav_ASR	we connect
71-2_4381.31_17.334.wav_ASR	and the first thing we would always do is go to the um the information centre in the triangle and get the maps and you know basically what we're gonna do
71-2_4399.31_1.66.wav_ASR	there's a guy there

71-2_4511.51_1.94.wav_ASR	yeah
71-2_4513.97_1.867.wav_ASR	well maybe there's a reason for that
71-2_4515.85_1.695.wav_ASR	yeah

71-2_4642.723_0.997.wav_ASR	uh the time
71-2_4643.84_0.556.wav_ASR	oh no
71-2_4644.543_1.18.wav_ASR	be this is what a title
71-2_4645.732_10.149.wav_ASR	we just thought a total and then we're so strange that somebody would be able to sleep in a uh a full long one and not be able to sleep when he's exhausted
71-2_4656.872_1.771.wav_ASR	it could not sleep if i was in that room
71-2_4658.952_2.411.wav_ASR	it just couldn't imagine all those women around them
71-2_4661.432_1.043.wav_ASR	we're sharing a battery
71-2_4663.072_0.5.wav_ASR	oh my
71-2_4663.885_1.9.wav_ASR	ah anyway yeah
71-2_4665.989_3.342.wav_ASR	that's better than the one where i had to say
71-2_4669.685_0.92.wav_ASR	you have any extras
71-2_4670.828_2.306.wav_ASR	and um which i think a t. v. you last week
71-2_4673.345_2.38.wav_ASR	oh no have a whole table story
71-2_4676.085_0.796.wav_ASR	yeah
71-2_4677.505_0.76.wav_ASR	that was one
71-2_4683.67_0.73.wav_ASR	okay
71-2_4684.79_1.88.wav_ASR	oh we've already talked about my okay
71-2_4687.29_1.19.wav_ASR	so i come up with a different one
71-2_4688.98_22.04.wav_ASR	um i used to have this thing that i would do to family members and friends um on their holidays their birthdays their birthdays their childrens uh in particular
71-2_4711.28_5.98.wav_ASR	and what i would do is i would usually go
71-2_4718.12_0.593.wav_ASR	it'd get up
71-2_4718.88_1.542.wav_ASR	it would excuse myself in the tape
71-2_4720.7_0.485.wav_ASR	yeah but go
71-2_4721.32_1.92.wav_ASR	and i would talk to uh the wires
71-2_4723.38_1.18.wav_ASR	that would say something like
71-2_4724.78_0.758.wav_ASR	is this my company
71-2_4725.64_1.14.wav_ASR	it's a bird then
71-2_4727.48_2.1.wav_ASR	he doesn't like any attachment
71-2_4729.698_4.925.wav_ASR	and so is there any point in time in which you could bring us um a cake
71-2_4734.623_3.695.wav_ASR	and then we could realise him by singing really loudly
71-2_4738.31_3.62.wav_ASR	and usually um the wait rest fast they're always
71-2_4742.318_0.971.wav_ASR	oh we don't have to do that
71-2_4743.298_0.762.wav_ASR	that would be fun
71-2_4744.738_1.792.wav_ASR	so i have this thing about doing that
71-2_4746.63_5.9.wav_ASR	and um very often i would bring my own candles um be the kind that don't glow up
71-2_4752.99_5.848.wav_ASR	um that's because then you can really really impressive people
71-2_4758.97_1.497.wav_ASR	yeah
71-2_4761.43_2.915.wav_ASR	oh oh it's my customers' budget
71-2_4764.86_4.14.wav_ASR	and his relationship with his girlfriend has just end
71-2_4769.48_3.76.wav_ASR	he's always kind of quiet and and shy
71-2_4774.06_7.648.wav_ASR	oh i decided that what we should really do is we should um call a lot of attention to him because this is good for him
71-2_4782.483_4.66.wav_ASR	so uh there were about fifteen of us there in the family
71-2_4787.403_2.28.wav_ASR	um we were all sitting in the same
71-2_4790.743_1.267.wav_ASR	we're in the same boat
71-2_4792.783_6.78.wav_ASR	but i decided that would actually add to the event if um we had people singing from a distance around him
71-2_4800.425_7.26.wav_ASR	oh i i took my news and newspaper with me uh to talk to the um wireless stat
71-2_4808.085_1.875.wav_ASR	and matty was then six
71-2_4810.545_1.415.wav_ASR	and evan was eight
71-2_4812.62_1.14.wav_ASR	so they came with me
71-2_4813.825_0.36.wav_ASR	nei
71-2_4814.405_1.486.wav_ASR	that's what we're gonna do the deed
71-2_4815.905_1.236.wav_ASR	oh we're gonna go for
71-2_4817.285_1.99.wav_ASR	we're going to summarize him on his briefing
71-2_4819.275_11.285.wav_ASR	so w what we have to do is is we have to make sure that everybody's gonna have to start at some point and that they shouldn't know in advance
71-2_4831.135_4.64.wav_ASR	so d. is over talking to i don't know some other related
71-2_4836.42_3.78.wav_ASR	and matthew and evan and i am running around talking about
71-2_4840.48_2.887.wav_ASR	okay now you have to sing very loud
71-2_4843.64_1.672.wav_ASR	you got it be very very quiet
71-2_4845.6_1.096.wav_ASR	yeah
71-2_4847.02_9.14.wav_ASR	so he hears my talking to the um i think it was his brother's company
71-2_4856.255_2.8.wav_ASR	now remember to send very very low
71-2_4859.535_1.02.wav_ASR	they are oh
71-2_4861.135_1.305.wav_ASR	injoying this whole process
71-2_4864.14_0.78.wav_ASR	oh we're just like
71-2_4865.495_0.665.wav_ASR	can be so
71-2_4866.355_0.48.wav_ASR	let's go
71-2_4867.715_1.611.wav_ASR	what are they going to do
71-2_4869.355_1.262.wav_ASR	you knew something was coming
71-2_4871.42_5.18.wav_ASR	but he didn't know about the type of uh production that we had put in
71-2_4876.94_5.5.wav_ASR	did you know about the special handles that wouldn't burn uh wouldn't blow out
71-2_4882.7_11.06.wav_ASR	you didn't know that we're gonna get the um the entire waste waste uh waiting stat uh people who are waiting on the tables to bring it
71-2_4894.34_6.12.wav_ASR	and he didn't know that everybody in my family would really enjoy the entire process that we're not
71-2_4900.46_6.912.wav_ASR	and you know we get very kind of um wow um uh when we do things like this
71-2_4907.74_2.645.wav_ASR	yeah of course they came from behind
71-2_4910.64_5.579.wav_ASR	the i only thought one um wood survey was going to bring the k
71-2_4917.02_1.8.wav_ASR	instead we had like six or so
71-2_4919.0_1.337.wav_ASR	everybody is excited to come along
71-2_4920.337_2.048.wav_ASR	oh my god
71-2_4922.677_1.435.wav_ASR	it came from behind
71-2_4924.697_6.411.wav_ASR	uh he could tell that it was coming because everybody's on the other side or ringing and looking at him
71-2_4931.777_2.24.wav_ASR	uh matthew and evan or just laugh
71-2_4934.457_1.743.wav_ASR	but really in a round and a tell
71-2_4936.937_0.93.wav_ASR	it's time to think now
71-2_4938.097_0.862.wav_ASR	it's time to think
71-2_4938.959_2.806.wav_ASR	oh and you got team uh got done
71-2_4941.979_0.74.wav_ASR	he smiles
71-2_4943.099_1.014.wav_ASR	you loo it out
71-2_4944.419_1.009.wav_ASR	came back again
71-2_4945.559_0.321.wav_ASR	let's see
71-2_4946.139_1.029.wav_ASR	you must be getting old
71-2_4947.999_3.841.wav_ASR	are you at least are you at least have the ability to blow out the camera
71-2_4951.84_1.08.wav_ASR	it can you at least do
71-2_4953.279_0.841.wav_ASR	oh
71-2_4955.019_0.65.wav_ASR	um
71-2_4955.879_0.703.wav_ASR	it's going
71-2_4956.739_1.861.wav_ASR	yeah you's looking at me
71-2_4958.6_2.165.wav_ASR	and he got down and said
71-2_4961.02_4.396.wav_ASR	you know uh oh i'm gonna remember this
71-2_4965.96_1.081.wav_ASR	oh you gotta remember that
71-2_4967.18_0.36.wav_ASR	let's see
71-2_4967.76_1.097.wav_ASR	was it a surprise
71-2_4968.88_0.538.wav_ASR	let's see
71-2_4969.54_2.689.wav_ASR	it was not a surprise when i heard maddy say
71-2_4972.7_2.78.wav_ASR	forget to send very very low
71-2_4976.56_11.193.wav_ASR	so um i will say that th i d you know i c i think i hate the like twenty dollars or something what she carried it off so well
71-2_4988.7_0.52.wav_ASR	it's
71-2_4989.46_1.132.wav_ASR	it was so much fun
71-2_4990.7_0.32.wav_ASR	it's fine
71-2_4991.1_1.881.wav_ASR	oh um
71-2_4992.981_3.44.wav_ASR	um and d. just look at me it's just
71-2_4998.102_3.085.wav_ASR	oh alright yeah anyway that was fine
71-2_5001.681_0.427.wav_ASR	that is
71-2_5016.87_9.94.wav_ASR	um back in the days when i would make kinetic butter and jelly sandwich because of course i can't anyway for all sorts of reasons
71-2_5026.95_5.193.wav_ASR	uh battery is saturated and too much sugar and all the rest of it
71-2_5032.23_5.632.wav_ASR	but back in the days when i would have done this oh what i would have done is that i would have started out with the brown
71-2_5038.61_13.295.wav_ASR	and i would have lost it because um the test texter of me then it comes better for me than it does um with uncosted bread and jelly
71-2_5052.65_3.64.wav_ASR	um so i would begin by putting it in the poster
71-2_5056.23_6.16.wav_ASR	and well it's stabilizing up i would hold out the pumpkin butter and the gel
71-2_5063.89_6.546.wav_ASR	um when the red comes out of the transmitter i would begin with the pumpkin but
71-2_5070.71_0.899.wav_ASR	it goes on the bottom
71-2_5071.89_4.232.wav_ASR	but i would do with a night is i would pull out some pen up button
71-2_5076.47_2.8.wav_ASR	it would spread it evenly on the bread
71-2_5079.93_2.64.wav_ASR	then i would take the other piece of toe
71-2_5083.17_7.54.wav_ASR	and i would take a spoon and um spongy
71-2_5091.25_1.174.wav_ASR	write it around even
71-2_5093.29_1.54.wav_ASR	and put the two of them together
71-2_5095.33_3.74.wav_ASR	and probably slice it before aed
71-2_5100.37_1.46.wav_ASR	uh i don't eat things like that anyway
71-2_5102.25_1.58.wav_ASR	if i did that's how i would do
71-2_5111.35_0.5.wav_ASR	oh
71-2_5112.173_4.003.wav_ASR	um well i think we talked about this last week
71-2_5116.353_4.662.wav_ASR	uh i'm not done my laundry since which means i need to do it at this point
71-2_5122.17_24.64.wav_ASR	um when i do laundry um when i'm able to do is not so much better um because i've got into the point that i only buy them um from colour and white um which is also much better for the environment
71-2_5147.64_14.38.wav_ASR	so all of my sold all of my deadline is already put aside um because as clothes begin to fail the smell test they end up in my
71-2_5163.84_1.68.wav_ASR	so when it's time to do the long
71-2_5205.68_2.96.wav_ASR	uh my plan is probably tomorrow after
71-2_5208.96_5.54.wav_ASR	have a break in between two different opinions that will allow me to do that
71-2_5214.8_4.46.wav_ASR	what i'm going to do is i'll pull into the the ladder which is on the base wall
71-2_5221.0_3.28.wav_ASR	oh i think it's about twenty one hundred
71-2_5224.612_5.38.wav_ASR	uh i will walk into a maintenance size washing machine
71-2_5230.452_2.529.wav_ASR	uh i will put all of my landlord in
71-2_5233.212_2.606.wav_ASR	we will not separate it by colour or white
71-2_5236.572_4.435.wav_ASR	uh will then add the two or sorry the stop at the top of it
71-2_5241.89_6.96.wav_ASR	then i will put in enough cords to be able to uh begin the cycle
71-2_5249.67_3.44.wav_ASR	and i will wash on my clothes on
71-2_5253.83_7.3.wav_ASR	um after the colours are in i push the cold water bowl
71-2_5261.412_5.86.wav_ASR	and then i take note of the fact that it will take twenty five minutes for it to wash
71-2_5300.51_7.94.wav_ASR	uh because it's tools and um spectors and things and switches and buttons that will take longer to to draw
71-2_5309.73_7.36.wav_ASR	then i throw it all back in the and take it home and then sometimes untold it or put it away
71-2_5317.17_8.72.wav_ASR	it sometimes i just take right out of the screen and put it on my uh my body or my bed or whatever i need it
71-2_5335.726_1.6.wav_ASR	it's okay
71-2_5338.086_0.904.wav_ASR	well i've never done that
71-2_5339.206_1.26.wav_ASR	ah i have tri
71-2_5341.05_1.916.wav_ASR	we'll make very clear that i have triangle
71-2_5343.826_8.14.wav_ASR	and have not i have not succeeded in doing so um for different reasons
71-2_5352.99_2.016.wav_ASR	um if i wanted to do it correct
71-2_5355.43_3.92.wav_ASR	and this is what it says on the seat
71-2_5360.33_1.64.wav_ASR	which has never worked for me
71-2_5362.41_2.88.wav_ASR	uh this is essentially the way that we would do
71-2_5365.51_1.04.wav_ASR	it would get
71-2_5368.81_1.36.wav_ASR	or i would get
71-2_5370.83_2.38.wav_ASR	and i would go to a plant
71-2_5374.88_3.677.wav_ASR	and there is one that's about a mile and a half from where i live
71-2_5378.64_3.28.wav_ASR	and you buy a special type of
71-2_5384.1_1.523.wav_ASR	it it comes in a bag
71-2_5385.8_1.105.wav_ASR	and i think it's it's
71-2_5387.32_6.933.wav_ASR	and i know is that it's it's it's full enough that you should be able to draw things on it
71-2_5394.253_3.88.wav_ASR	and i would put this into a pot
71-2_5398.493_12.547.wav_ASR	and i would make sure that there was uh a hold in it for legacy so that if you put the water in the water it'll be able to drain out into a tray
71-2_5412.06_6.94.wav_ASR	um put the pot near a window so that there's enough s
71-2_5420.54_3.72.wav_ASR	and what i would do is make sure that the
71-2_5424.56_4.012.wav_ASR	uh first i would read the directions on the sheet package which i've done before
71-2_5429.36_2.358.wav_ASR	is you have to go down about two inches
71-2_5431.718_2.05.wav_ASR	is you take a seat
71-2_5434.438_1.243.wav_ASR	oh you place it
71-2_5436.118_0.689.wav_ASR	uh cover
71-2_5437.218_1.782.wav_ASR	you water it
71-2_5439.278_1.558.wav_ASR	then you leave it alone
71-2_5441.258_2.82.wav_ASR	supposedly naturally takes its core
71-2_5444.438_5.88.wav_ASR	um in my particular situation one time i didn't have enough sun
71-2_5451.69_10.26.wav_ASR	um another time i simply overwatered it to the point that the the soil was so saturated that the speed
71-2_5463.05_8.069.wav_ASR	and i think the other time it's just was too cold in my apartment to be able to scroll in the way that it was supposed to
71-2_5471.119_2.542.wav_ASR	but i've seen other people do it
71-2_5473.819_1.78.wav_ASR	uh no the process exists
71-2_5475.839_4.031.wav_ASR	it just been un able to actually do it in anyway that makes it actually
71-2_5480.75_10.703.wav_ASR	oh yeah i'm still on the potential status of stage of understanding of what you're supposed to be able to do
71-2_5491.453_11.589.wav_ASR	but i haven't yet figured out how to keep the soil dry enough that it it can um it can spread without me covering it to the point that i wrote it
71-2_5503.85_5.443.wav_ASR	so i think there's a balance i haven't yet achieved to be able to do it
84-1_17.07_2.48.wav_ASR	it would have to say one of my favourite traits
84-1_19.816_4.091.wav_ASR	have my wife and i have two sons that are older now
84-1_24.096_5.94.wav_ASR	and for a number of years we want skiing in you ta in paris
84-1_31.276_2.24.wav_ASR	uh i really enjoyed the opportunity
84-1_33.838_6.2.wav_ASR	so my youngest was probably about three years old and my older is probably about
84-1_40.738_1.181.wav_ASR	it's probably a little
84-1_42.198_2.46.wav_ASR	be like five and
84-1_45.878_4.42.wav_ASR	that's just so much fun to get out there and and
84-1_50.529_3.88.wav_ASR	uh i could ski already but my but my two kids
84-1_55.149_1.45.wav_ASR	the white speed a little bit
84-1_56.809_3.24.wav_ASR	my two kids became pretty good seller
84-1_60.329_3.354.wav_ASR	ah um pretty sure that a lot of them was
84-1_63.693_8.407.wav_ASR	we had a guide when we were in um in in um in
84-1_72.333_1.915.wav_ASR	it just costs the name of a play
84-1_74.633_3.58.wav_ASR	um one we are in the euro
84-1_78.653_2.88.wav_ASR	uh we were guided by him for a number of years and
84-1_81.538_1.66.wav_ASR	he did a really good job
84-1_83.198_9.633.wav_ASR	oh i hope that will give you a little bit of a sense of how much i number one i drew my kids and number two
84-1_100.218_1.397.wav_ASR	it it is very nice
84-1_127.149_12.52.wav_ASR	well i just um i just got accepted to be part of the bar again in television in panel
84-1_141.089_3.08.wav_ASR	it would say my my skills
84-1_144.711_5.549.wav_ASR	uh i d i don't i think my skills are pretty good
84-1_150.311_2.822.wav_ASR	they're never gonna be great as they want
84-1_153.811_8.199.wav_ASR	so i would say on a scale of one to ten right now i would say i'm probably a sa
84-1_162.21_3.04.wav_ASR	so i feel like i made a lot of progress
84-1_165.81_5.761.wav_ASR	but i know that there's more progress i need to make especially wi with with big words
84-1_172.07_1.91.wav_ASR	big words can be difficult for me
84-1_174.17_3.53.wav_ASR	oh i do see a speech transmitter once a week and
84-1_177.77_3.733.wav_ASR	it's been extremely extremely helpful for me
84-1_181.503_0.887.wav_ASR	oh i like her
84-1_182.39_6.734.wav_ASR	and i have uh i also have something that's some um some work out with me
84-1_189.203_1.429.wav_ASR	the two of them are just great
84-1_196.9_1.27.wav_ASR	oh i remember that pretty well
84-1_207.12_2.95.wav_ASR	well my wife was away for the weekend
84-1_210.39_2.78.wav_ASR	we had a house in australia
84-1_214.15_3.64.wav_ASR	and i remember that week in because i had to work
84-1_217.968_4.82.wav_ASR	and i thought the biggest thing we c i could do for the week end was to stay home
84-1_223.738_8.03.wav_ASR	so i think she probably went down there on maybe windows or the r. s
84-1_232.508_2.66.wav_ASR	and i came home from work on friday
84-1_236.128_0.848.wav_ASR	uh had
84-1_236.976_0.998.wav_ASR	it did some work
84-1_238.176_2.0.wav_ASR	uh i get up in the next morning
84-1_240.536_5.24.wav_ASR	that was the thirty thirty um
84-1_247.676_1.721.wav_ASR	and i felt pretty good
84-1_249.716_1.188.wav_ASR	it won't about my day
84-1_251.576_2.08.wav_ASR	uh went out for a basic ride
84-1_254.296_1.0.wav_ASR	and i came home
84-1_255.22_20.6.wav_ASR	and that night was the night that um roo um
84-1_276.504_5.66.wav_ASR	and so on Saturday night i went to bed a little bit
84-1_282.524_4.46.wav_ASR	but um well i i thought there might be some bullet
84-1_287.724_3.66.wav_ASR	and i also thought it would be helpful in the mornings
84-1_291.464_1.784.wav_ASR	so i could clean up a little bit
84-1_293.7_2.69.wav_ASR	so we live in a fairly nice area
84-1_297.14_2.43.wav_ASR	and i went to bed around ten thirty
84-1_300.6_5.7.wav_ASR	and that night Saturday night there was a lot of violence in in centre centred
84-1_307.16_3.84.wav_ASR	and i remember that that a b that a b that a b that a p that a p that a p that a p that a p that a p that a p that a p that a p that a p that a p that a p that a p that a p that a p that a p that a p that a p
84-1_315.929_2.242.wav_ASR	and so i got that
84-1_318.529_2.98.wav_ASR	uh i live in a fairly secure place
84-1_322.129_4.884.wav_ASR	and um the next morning i got up really early and went out so
84-1_327.229_1.08.wav_ASR	it's a total mess
84-1_329.189_1.324.wav_ASR	so i started cleaning up
84-1_331.129_3.4.wav_ASR	and sometimes the during the day i felt a little bit
84-1_334.969_1.819.wav_ASR	so i went back home
84-1_337.0_1.019.wav_ASR	ah rested for a little
84-1_338.309_1.26.wav_ASR	went up got a paper
84-1_340.069_2.184.wav_ASR	and then i thought pretty good for the rest of the day
84-1_342.769_10.717.wav_ASR	and sometimes on that twenty nine and o. i mean it's and i mean s and i had my scroll
84-1_354.11_3.04.wav_ASR	and in the morning my wife could not get a hold of me
84-1_357.75_1.397.wav_ASR	so we have a door man here
84-1_359.39_0.831.wav_ASR	you want an
84-1_360.85_1.3.wav_ASR	and i was on the floor
84-1_362.37_2.0.wav_ASR	and so he call an animal
84-1_364.67_4.58.wav_ASR	but i um i my wife was in um active remote
84-1_369.477_7.22.wav_ASR	so um she was told that i'd better that i should that
84-1_377.397_1.08.wav_ASR	yeah bad with
84-1_378.897_3.68.wav_ASR	um that my wife should come home
84-1_382.428_8.24.wav_ASR	and i have one s one who's in um one who's in the normals and one who's in the normals and one who's in the normals
84-1_391.348_6.86.wav_ASR	they were told it was probably a good idea for them to come home because i wasn't sure what was gonna happen
84-1_398.267_6.5.wav_ASR	and so i remember distinctly that i was brought into the the emergency room
84-1_405.227_2.72.wav_ASR	apparently i d i could not say a lot more
84-1_407.987_2.86.wav_ASR	my voice was very garbur
84-1_411.47_14.3.wav_ASR	um but the end by the end of my my wife told me later that um she thought i was gonna sh he wasn't not sure wha what kinda shape i'd be in
84-1_425.77_14.463.wav_ASR	but by the end of the summary which was um uh i had a bluetooth um i was able to be able to live
84-1_440.31_3.579.wav_ASR	they didn't know how much exactly i'll be able to do
84-1_444.38_6.0.wav_ASR	so i um i spent about six eight weeks in the in um reha
84-1_451.21_2.29.wav_ASR	and i came out not sure what i could
84-1_453.84_4.18.wav_ASR	oh today i i i feel pretty good about my voice
84-1_458.6_2.9.wav_ASR	does i said i still feel like there's more i can do
84-1_462.06_4.25.wav_ASR	so as i said i think i'm about seventy percent right now
84-1_478.63_9.28.wav_ASR	well i was in the hall i was in reha for eight weeks about a place that's about maybe eight blocks from here
84-1_488.29_1.76.wav_ASR	and it was a time when it was cool
84-1_490.47_3.04.wav_ASR	so it wasn't really easy for me to see people
84-1_494.13_3.84.wav_ASR	but one of the one of the people where we live
84-1_498.084_2.28.wav_ASR	because i live in a high story building
84-1_501.2_9.29.wav_ASR	one of the person was like maybe the second or third command at jeferson which is where i want to for my reha
84-1_511.17_8.41.wav_ASR	and um this person who's name is kate was allowed to get two people in to see me today
84-1_520.09_3.903.wav_ASR	uh i i got to see well my two sisters came in
84-1_524.19_2.789.wav_ASR	and my my children came in
84-1_527.21_2.02.wav_ASR	and then my white came in
84-1_529.33_4.5.wav_ASR	so i had a very good
84-1_534.47_8.45.wav_ASR	and so each day i would have um i would have um o. t. p. and speech
84-1_543.73_2.66.wav_ASR	that was every day except for batteries and
84-1_554.07_3.15.wav_ASR	well what can that there's nothing i can do about
84-1_558.98_2.94.wav_ASR	so i i mean i understand i had to deal with that
84-1_562.65_2.916.wav_ASR	yeah i always feel with it but i try to
84-1_590.17_3.99.wav_ASR	well i have to tell you i've had a pretty good life until my death
84-1_595.73_3.421.wav_ASR	it would say that one of the best things that ever happened to me was
84-1_599.151_7.46.wav_ASR	um i was in a program at a school called Wesley
84-1_607.212_12.7.wav_ASR	and when i was there part of this this programme i was in this console it so that i had to spend a semester uh
84-1_620.93_9.96.wav_ASR	and during starting in like seventeen grade through high school and then into college i spoke fran french pretty well
84-1_631.61_7.66.wav_ASR	um because i had a technique in in nokia who is at the time going out with one of the cup base player
84-1_639.596_3.36.wav_ASR	and so um she was friend
84-1_643.098_1.783.wav_ASR	and she's used to talk about that a lot
84-1_645.456_2.323.wav_ASR	and so i took a class from her
84-1_648.376_1.811.wav_ASR	and somehow i did pretty well
84-1_650.376_6.36.wav_ASR	oh when i when i w then i was in the programme at um at west
84-1_657.064_3.6.wav_ASR	and i would say one of the Happiest actions for me was graphical
84-1_661.59_8.094.wav_ASR	uh i i i want up doing pretty well at the school and um even though i've got in on a wait list
84-1_670.684_1.52.wav_ASR	yeah it was really exciting
84-1_672.25_9.12.wav_ASR	uh i d i d i knew a bunch of people in my class but i was really close with the class of eighty
84-1_681.67_2.875.wav_ASR	and um it was just a fun time for me uh
84-1_684.545_1.765.wav_ASR	uh i was present in my material
84-1_687.01_6.06.wav_ASR	and i i i met someone who became one of my closest friends
84-1_693.27_2.1.wav_ASR	he was the prototype at w
84-1_695.55_2.306.wav_ASR	so i it was really nice
84-1_698.38_8.68.wav_ASR	uh i s then uh after i graduated from high school i spent some vacations with him and some of my roommates
84-1_707.68_2.16.wav_ASR	he was someone who is remote
84-1_710.58_2.476.wav_ASR	he want to harbour a dolphin
84-1_713.273_5.48.wav_ASR	and at the end of his frustration he went down he went down he went down he went down he went down he went down he went down he went down he went down
84-1_719.733_2.72.wav_ASR	and he went down to the um book store
84-1_722.973_3.56.wav_ASR	and he bought all books about r television remote controls
84-1_726.863_7.22.wav_ASR	so he went back to go back to s to campus and he changed
84-1_734.443_1.76.wav_ASR	he was already in last call
84-1_736.563_2.08.wav_ASR	he'd been under graduated in a presentation
84-1_739.263_4.24.wav_ASR	and he and he um after his first year of winning the remote he said
84-1_743.663_0.992.wav_ASR	it wasn't for me
84-1_744.8_5.82.wav_ASR	and he went to at a p a program in a television remote controls his
84-1_756.57_3.48.wav_ASR	yeah i had uh i was really it was good place for
84-1_764.754_4.32.wav_ASR	uh i have it been visiting since my scroll
84-1_769.655_5.279.wav_ASR	but i used to be you know i used to be fairly involved it it it the user
84-1_775.834_6.1.wav_ASR	and my youngest my youngest son went there after spending a year in school
84-1_782.807_7.94.wav_ASR	and he really did a oh uh he was he did really well at the school
84-1_790.907_3.04.wav_ASR	oh i was very excited for him
84-1_828.61_2.67.wav_ASR	well i had to know these pictures quite well
84-1_832.07_3.18.wav_ASR	um it's a story about a kid playing
84-1_836.05_3.3.wav_ASR	and he hit the b he struck the ball
84-1_839.99_3.52.wav_ASR	and went through the window of a nearby house
84-1_843.796_24.848.wav_ASR	and labelled by one of the young or um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um just a w a regular person who lived in the house
84-1_868.644_20.254.wav_ASR	and then he looked out the window to see if he could figure out his on his on his laptop on his um r no on his laptop
84-1_907.89_1.94.wav_ASR	uh this one i al
84-1_909.988_8.342.wav_ASR	it's about a young boy who when he went to school he was deciding whether or not to take an element
84-1_918.59_2.6.wav_ASR	he decided not to take the animal
84-1_921.69_2.48.wav_ASR	and it turned out that it it's started running
84-1_924.87_1.88.wav_ASR	so he went back home
84-1_926.94_1.818.wav_ASR	and he was sleeping
84-1_929.34_2.127.wav_ASR	but apparently he changed his clothes
84-1_932.02_5.76.wav_ASR	he went back outside with a arrow so that he could get to school
84-1_938.24_6.041.wav_ASR	um i assume we went to school on time but i really don't know whether that's part of the story or not
84-1_957.58_7.15.wav_ASR	so this is a little curve maybe under ten who had a cat who had a cat
84-1_965.45_7.58.wav_ASR	so apparently the f the dead got off his um god a later
84-1_973.283_3.967.wav_ASR	uh curve was um
84-1_977.59_1.904.wav_ASR	he stopped and looked at the cat
84-1_979.94_19.956.wav_ASR	so the cat went up to get the cat
84-1_999.896_13.754.wav_ASR	and i guess the um they um um the laundry got kicked away so that the s the button was stuck up there with the um cat
84-1_1014.556_2.6.wav_ASR	and the the dock started bar
84-1_1017.78_2.68.wav_ASR	and eventually the fire department came
84-1_1021.24_0.94.wav_ASR	they were able
84-1_1022.44_0.5.wav_ASR	prose
84-1_1023.32_0.654.wav_ASR	don't oh
84-1_1024.06_3.563.wav_ASR	but i think they were able to get the cat and get the man down
84-1_1188.54_7.06.wav_ASR	so this is a story about a a young man name sender
84-1_1196.189_19.982.wav_ASR	and she was working at a place where there was a um mill age laboratory and two people who had grown up with her and in trying to get them
84-1_1216.59_15.38.wav_ASR	so it turned out that the that the that there was a young price who is living with her with his family
84-1_1232.85_29.52.wav_ASR	and the young print is decided that they should get out if anybody if the people that in having a relationship that in having a relationship with the colours
84-1_1263.48_2.52.wav_ASR	and i don't remember the name of the president
84-1_1266.09_4.89.wav_ASR	but so they send around an invitation to all the people in the community
84-1_1272.04_9.98.wav_ASR	the two young ladies who lived with uh with her who lived with her who lived with her
84-1_1284.38_8.84.wav_ASR	her older brother decided that they would go to the ball and start getting dressed to go to the ball
84-1_1293.98_17.52.wav_ASR	but it's like a carrot on the profit and i was stuck doing things like washing the floor and cleaning the floor and stuff like that she found out about they being this um
84-1_1312.413_4.54.wav_ASR	and she wanted to know if there was some way she could adapt
84-1_1317.593_1.78.wav_ASR	so she
84-1_1320.333_2.28.wav_ASR	don't remember exactly how it happened
84-1_1323.133_6.02.wav_ASR	oh she was able to get into touch with somebody i think they call the
84-1_1330.065_3.52.wav_ASR	and um she talked to the friendly god
84-1_1334.45_20.985.wav_ASR	and so well the two people from the from the from the house who are going with their their their their delay um um she decided that she could go
84-1_1355.435_4.2.wav_ASR	so she got dressed up in in fancy clothes
84-1_1360.415_5.337.wav_ASR	and she was told by the friendly godmother that she could go to the ball
84-1_1365.795_1.72.wav_ASR	but she had only one requirement
84-1_1368.295_2.94.wav_ASR	and that is that should be back by a minute
84-1_1371.407_11.811.wav_ASR	so she went to the ball and fell in love with the price and was having a good time with the price
84-1_1383.218_12.28.wav_ASR	but when the cr clock straight right um signal uh new that she had to get out of there
84-1_1396.098_5.08.wav_ASR	so she raised for the door and down the steps and into the chairs
84-1_1401.35_2.26.wav_ASR	but soon the parameters
84-1_1404.69_9.9.wav_ASR	and she was by herself with i think some young people who may have been like rabbits and other memories of the of the computer
84-1_1415.23_19.09.wav_ASR	um so um so um the one principle was looking for that the the young lady who had disappeared at midnight
84-1_1434.84_11.51.wav_ASR	and sh he sent out a i guess some sort of play or something that if the person was around she should please contact him
84-1_1446.76_12.16.wav_ASR	and when that in happened then a young man went around the village to see if by chance anybody do any thing about this young man went around
84-1_1459.92_3.1.wav_ASR	and when she went to the house that had the two
84-1_1463.595_2.1.wav_ASR	uh guess you might by now call it s
84-1_1468.04_9.89.wav_ASR	um she i think somehow got a hold of signal uh who may be like watching clothes in the basement or something
84-1_1478.88_7.897.wav_ASR	and when she was brought up stars the one shoe that had been left behind she tried on that one shoe
84-1_1486.777_13.623.wav_ASR	and it fit her so that it she's doing to continue to like this young lady
84-1_1501.077_2.06.wav_ASR	and so i guess they got back together
84-1_1503.537_1.94.wav_ASR	apparently they got married
84-1_1550.75_3.76.wav_ASR	never really had a lot of experiences with black
84-1_1555.47_3.2.wav_ASR	it was pretty much always on time
84-1_1559.37_10.68.wav_ASR	and when i was growing up particularly when i was in high school there for some reason it was no real time limit on what time i had to get home
84-1_1570.61_8.74.wav_ASR	so um i was you know i went to a lot of parties on friday night and Saturday night and came home when i wanted
84-1_1579.38_20.6.wav_ASR	uh i think it was in large part 'cause my two so that you know sh how to be um how to be able to know when i'm to take me how to be um how to be able to know
84-1_1600.084_3.495.wav_ASR	so i mean there are a few times when i was out too late
84-1_1604.124_2.309.wav_ASR	uh nothing really ever happened to me
84-1_1606.924_3.866.wav_ASR	and then when i went to college i would come home during the summer
84-1_1611.804_6.56.wav_ASR	and i remember that um i was involved with the couple younger ladies
84-1_1618.528_4.623.wav_ASR	but i would go out with them but i could get home whenever i wanted to
84-1_1623.52_6.58.wav_ASR	and i remember one stat summary i had a job that required me to be to work at six o'clock in the morning
84-1_1630.928_3.42.wav_ASR	so sometimes during the summer i will stay out on night and then go to work
84-1_1645.61_7.485.wav_ASR	well so i worked a lot pretty when i had i was uh i turned out to be
84-1_1653.47_2.186.wav_ASR	think i'm maybe i have told this
84-1_1655.73_0.463.wav_ASR	oh sh
84-1_1656.193_3.42.wav_ASR	but i work for a french company
84-1_1660.878_8.049.wav_ASR	and um i when i had my stroke i started thinking about things i could do
84-1_1668.927_8.2.wav_ASR	cause really between my calculations and between um a lot of time i spent pretty much with my children
84-1_1678.067_2.92.wav_ASR	they were in a town in new jersey called print
84-1_1681.727_2.08.wav_ASR	and they both played a lot of hockey
84-1_1684.367_2.89.wav_ASR	um so i never really had a lot of time
84-1_1687.246_2.783.wav_ASR	but one thing i've decided that i'm going to do
84-1_1690.506_4.76.wav_ASR	with in the past within the next year we're gonna be moving a little further south
84-1_1695.886_3.08.wav_ASR	and i really thought that one thing i could do was bird
84-1_1699.586_2.933.wav_ASR	because i always had an interest in that
84-1_1702.606_1.984.wav_ASR	but never really focused on that
84-1_1705.086_1.62.wav_ASR	and i really thought particularly
84-1_1706.856_2.9.wav_ASR	now i write a three real budget
84-1_1709.936_4.506.wav_ASR	like can't write a m a two wheel basic like i used to do
84-1_1714.521_16.081.wav_ASR	so i'm really hoping that w we'll i can learn yeah um about birds and maybe because i think that would be a good thing for me to do
84-1_1736.76_2.52.wav_ASR	oh c so did she live in blue tim
84-1_1760.0_20.64.wav_ASR	well i i guess when i started the pro when i started the project
84-1_1780.938_3.5.wav_ASR	but they quickly figured out that i could speak
84-1_1785.098_1.94.wav_ASR	so the losers were in front
84-1_1787.898_2.948.wav_ASR	and i was one of the feweners outside of France
84-1_1791.078_1.06.wav_ASR	it was in the unit
84-1_1793.658_4.48.wav_ASR	um they used to send me to various places
84-1_1798.398_5.96.wav_ASR	and i remember that i stayed in a real nice hotel in
84-1_1805.978_2.42.wav_ASR	and i also stayed in a nice hotel
84-1_1809.158_3.84.wav_ASR	uh i was in a a nice hotel when i went to china
84-1_1813.177_5.8.wav_ASR	and i also was in a nice overall when i was in um
84-1_1822.457_6.54.wav_ASR	so i i and uh during one of the times i was there and it was the fourth
84-1_1829.537_3.16.wav_ASR	so i remember that the start brought me a little cake
84-1_1833.15_7.12.wav_ASR	um so i just i l i i i i don't really need a big alert although my wife likes some
84-1_1841.05_10.3.wav_ASR	um i um i always thought i was in places that i could be comfortable even when um even one
84-1_1851.626_2.28.wav_ASR	yeah i i do remember saying in one second
84-1_1854.01_5.896.wav_ASR	oh it's in germany for a for to be part of a case that was pending
84-1_1860.446_2.235.wav_ASR	and we stayed in a god hotel
84-1_1862.726_3.066.wav_ASR	even even that turn out to be good for me
84-1_1865.941_11.7.wav_ASR	so it would g it was a good way for me to learn about the way different roles can stretch me different
84-1_1878.421_3.38.wav_ASR	uh i was in a whole tall part of a rabbit
84-1_1882.0_1.381.wav_ASR	remember that pretty well
84-1_1897.088_7.408.wav_ASR	well when i was in college there was this project
84-1_1904.816_0.654.wav_ASR	think i thought you
84-1_1905.47_0.58.wav_ASR	the pro
84-1_1906.59_6.9.wav_ASR	and the c. was there for about about thirty thirty five years
84-1_1913.91_2.92.wav_ASR	and in nineteen ninety nine he died
84-1_1917.85_5.54.wav_ASR	um but before that time he and a group of people
84-1_1923.607_16.1.wav_ASR	there was uh one person from the class of sixty five one person from the class of eighty nine which is me and a person from the class of eighty nine
84-1_1939.914_5.6.wav_ASR	the three of us the six five of us became very good friends
84-1_1945.874_9.776.wav_ASR	and every year 'cause w w w did not have any um did not really have any frustration
84-1_1955.75_8.1.wav_ASR	he was he had a child who's when when when he was i think maybe six or seven years old
84-1_1964.11_8.96.wav_ASR	and and so one thing he used to do wants a quarter from kinetic he also used to go down to the newsc
84-1_1973.501_5.94.wav_ASR	and we stayed in it we would we would i went for my graduation
84-1_1979.861_3.68.wav_ASR	that went for every year there after for about twenty five years
84-1_1983.921_5.12.wav_ASR	but i want to uh place that's no longer in existence but it's called
84-1_1989.678_3.6.wav_ASR	and um it was a very nice
84-1_1994.718_3.712.wav_ASR	um and we just had a wonderful time every
84-1_1998.43_14.51.wav_ASR	so i really think about that a lot and remember just how much fun i had with these people and how much i still keep in contact with them
84-1_2012.94_5.74.wav_ASR	and so these these people are some very um well known people
84-1_2019.2_6.8.wav_ASR	and um so i already had one of the words has already died
84-1_2026.88_4.22.wav_ASR	uh he was the head of this thing called the the
84-1_2031.651_17.0.wav_ASR	it's a big it's a big um it's a big it's a big
84-1_2048.851_0.828.wav_ASR	forget the name
84-1_2049.811_1.4.wav_ASR	they have a huge trap
84-1_2051.568_3.28.wav_ASR	and so he's gonna retire and move back to new year
84-1_2055.648_10.086.wav_ASR	so i'm very excited that at the end um supplement i'm gonna be meeting with them and uh and these people who go back to the class is sixty two
84-1_2066.128_2.086.wav_ASR	so i'm i'm looking forward to
84-1_2068.397_8.98.wav_ASR	uh i i sometimes i kind of wish i'd be a little better than i am now
84-1_2077.677_3.26.wav_ASR	uh they all know i had um i had a stroke
84-1_2081.677_3.36.wav_ASR	um i i'm really looking forward
84-1_2085.17_5.06.wav_ASR	most days some days i think that maybe i shouldn't go 'cause i'm not far enough
84-1_2090.73_1.56.wav_ASR	but it's it's um
84-1_2093.19_1.8.wav_ASR	can't really remember what we were talking about
84-1_2100.86_4.44.wav_ASR	so so so we went to this very nice restri
84-1_2105.464_2.296.wav_ASR	we did it for about twenty or twenty five years
84-1_2108.22_5.907.wav_ASR	and it was a place for me and for the other people that were in the in the in the group
84-1_2114.08_11.39.wav_ASR	we used to do it in December 'cause it was near the time when one of our favourite people from the class um sixty two had a budget
84-1_2132.16_4.04.wav_ASR	it was a french restaurant oh
84-1_2137.66_14.62.wav_ASR	it's if you if you go back to the ninety nine seventy nine it's a fifty nine west two fifty nine i think fifty nine
84-1_2152.28_7.02.wav_ASR	it's in a in a in a nice old um billiard that has three or four floors
84-1_2159.56_1.7.wav_ASR	um it was exactly
84-1_2161.495_22.32.wav_ASR	and um because we could go there um um three or four times throughout the year they need him um for the birthday party um for the birthday party um it was it was just fancy
84-1_2184.085_1.14.wav_ASR	it was really nice
84-1_2189.53_1.988.wav_ASR	it's not there yeah
84-1_2191.525_0.84.wav_ASR	it was
84-1_2192.725_1.984.wav_ASR	there was a and his wife
84-1_2195.385_3.86.wav_ASR	and i think they're basically you know
84-1_2199.985_8.94.wav_ASR	and they sold the restaurant to a guy who was i think from either France or from germany
84-1_2210.365_2.624.wav_ASR	um he did not do a very good job
84-1_2212.939_7.3.wav_ASR	so it i would say after three or four years it um it it it didn't exist anymore
84-1_2224.89_2.489.wav_ASR	now we're we're so um we're going to
84-1_2228.519_2.26.wav_ASR	oh the file who it is
84-1_2231.118_5.52.wav_ASR	uh c why i could remember the name of the place that he was in my yeah
84-1_2237.538_4.0.wav_ASR	but he he has one son who's got three wonderful child
84-1_2242.058_2.84.wav_ASR	they live in in in northern Europe
84-1_2245.216_14.64.wav_ASR	so my friend who's now is has has fixed up a place i think in the fifty or sixties in new years
84-1_2260.677_6.594.wav_ASR	so i know that's where the party is gonna be because the apartament is apparently finished now
84-1_2267.297_1.81.wav_ASR	he's been working on that for a couple of years
84-1_2290.78_3.59.wav_ASR	oh interestingly enough i had one for lunch
84-1_2296.1_4.56.wav_ASR	um i like it once in a while
84-1_2300.734_16.34.wav_ASR	one of the people who is in who one of the people who's part of the group of sixty five or six
84-1_2317.101_4.2.wav_ASR	and he has a p. n. butter and a jelly sandwich for lunch
84-1_2321.761_2.78.wav_ASR	oh what you do is you take two pieces of brown
84-1_2325.321_9.159.wav_ASR	um um i have my bread um i have my bread and the fridge 'cause i only use a certain amount of it anyway
84-1_2335.061_1.789.wav_ASR	so i take the pieces out
84-1_2336.89_7.96.wav_ASR	uh i th i'd i'd they become they become they p come to room temperature
84-1_2347.07_2.92.wav_ASR	then i have a special penguin button that i use
84-1_2350.01_1.08.wav_ASR	yeah but i can't cost
84-1_2353.6_1.85.wav_ASR	well the p. d. a. battery there is natural
84-1_2356.05_2.9.wav_ASR	that's the p. n. button i buy
84-1_2359.35_3.68.wav_ASR	and i would we have a few chairs in that around
84-1_2363.63_3.48.wav_ASR	so i would open the jar take some penant button
84-1_2367.83_2.504.wav_ASR	and then i would take different kinds of colour
84-1_2370.434_9.058.wav_ASR	but right now i'm uh on a kick where i have um it's like broccoli and raspberry together in a mix
84-1_2380.014_1.86.wav_ASR	and i put that on the sandwich
84-1_2382.514_2.34.wav_ASR	then i closed the sandwich
84-1_2385.454_3.553.wav_ASR	and you can either um cut it in half or leave it whole
84-1_2389.007_2.9.wav_ASR	and for some stupid reason i always leave it on
84-1_2392.387_1.62.wav_ASR	and i had one was a nice sample
84-1_2394.347_5.34.wav_ASR	oh i had so i had that about one thirty as i was providing for my two o'clock call
84-1_2413.71_5.31.wav_ASR	well warning is something i still try to do but i think my wife t probably does more of it
84-1_2420.092_4.906.wav_ASR	oh i would choose what kind of template i would want in it
84-1_2424.998_6.36.wav_ASR	but typically i would choose cold water because most of the stuff i need to watch is cold water
84-1_2431.958_3.042.wav_ASR	so i would in the special we have a machine
84-1_2435.278_2.14.wav_ASR	we live in that in the part
84-1_2437.656_7.8.wav_ASR	it we live in a area of that use to be that was where we have to buy the command
84-1_2446.076_9.42.wav_ASR	but because we're getting ready to move next year we sold into um a remote unit in the same building
84-1_2455.617_4.36.wav_ASR	so we would um we would get to the wires that
84-1_2461.32_13.017.wav_ASR	we um one the water's set it's a machine that it it comes out on the side
84-1_2474.39_1.33.wav_ASR	so there's nothing on the top
84-1_2476.55_1.89.wav_ASR	oh we have to load the wash
84-1_2479.39_8.06.wav_ASR	and then we put the the the the the the in it and start it
84-1_2487.48_6.74.wav_ASR	and you can see it um from the um from the we can see it from the
84-1_2495.135_8.325.wav_ASR	now it's not something that's it's something that is um easy to see from the floor
84-1_2504.52_2.52.wav_ASR	and so we put it on wire
84-1_2507.302_4.58.wav_ASR	and it usually lasts for some reason for a hour and five minutes
84-1_2512.062_3.808.wav_ASR	but after an hour and five minutes the wash is done
84-1_2515.962_6.0.wav_ASR	if we have particular clothes that need put on a line we would typically put it on the line
84-1_2522.162_4.18.wav_ASR	the rest of it would go into the dryer where it would dry
84-1_2526.352_8.24.wav_ASR	and then it would be ready to be folded in the couple of drawers that we use for for um
84-1_2535.332_2.932.wav_ASR	um my wife has quite a few more than i do
84-1_2538.264_8.158.wav_ASR	but um it's a place where we can put our stuff um and um use it as we as we need to
84-1_2557.42_3.87.wav_ASR	well you have to understand that now i have it takes me a while
84-1_2562.42_5.82.wav_ASR	um so i usually get up in the morning
84-1_2568.47_8.6.wav_ASR	and i have i will put on my on my
84-1_2578.86_3.09.wav_ASR	and then i would put on my sh
84-1_2583.37_2.06.wav_ASR	uh i would put on my sa
84-1_2586.38_6.68.wav_ASR	and then i would lie in bed for a little bit and do some exercise 'cause exercise is very important to me
84-1_2593.52_9.62.wav_ASR	especially even though i'm nearly more than th three years ago it's still important for me to um get some exercise in every day
84-1_2603.74_0.96.wav_ASR	so i do that
84-1_2604.776_5.64.wav_ASR	and then i will typically one that is done i'll turn on the t. v.
84-1_2610.876_6.2.wav_ASR	and i'll get dressed the rest of my way which includes um you know my side
84-1_2617.536_4.7.wav_ASR	but i haven't seen this but i wear a price on my right foot
84-1_2622.416_1.873.wav_ASR	oh i put that on as well
84-1_2624.77_4.28.wav_ASR	and i um i start my day
84-2_12.09_1.1.wav_ASR	my favourite holiday
84-2_13.79_9.28.wav_ASR	um it's easily getting um 'cause y i have a very small family but usually the family comes as well as my two son
84-2_24.03_1.468.wav_ASR	now one of them is ready
84-2_25.77_2.32.wav_ASR	but the uh and the others gonna be married pretty soon
84-2_28.25_4.26.wav_ASR	so i look forward to a table with m a few more people
84-2_32.564_2.32.wav_ASR	um i have two sisters
84-2_35.624_2.44.wav_ASR	one of them who lists i think i told you in the newsletter
84-2_38.244_1.46.wav_ASR	one of them who lives in chicago
84-2_40.424_2.76.wav_ASR	um so they typically come
84-2_43.573_14.028.wav_ASR	and um for many many years i have um um until i had my stroke i was in charge of the cookie which i do on a globe
84-2_58.053_1.58.wav_ASR	so it's really really nice
84-2_60.413_2.52.wav_ASR	now i don't do it on the globe anymore
84-2_63.47_4.5.wav_ASR	and we had it use to have a place at the shore but we don't have that anymore
84-2_68.71_4.28.wav_ASR	oh i somebody else cuts it in the evening
84-2_78.94_7.65.wav_ASR	well i've been the host for thanks giving since my mother died in ninety nine
84-2_86.96_1.04.wav_ASR	oh it's been a while
84-2_92.66_0.372.wav_ASR	it is
84-2_93.22_2.6.wav_ASR	it's it's nice but it doesn't last for very long
84-2_100.512_2.1.wav_ASR	oh we celebrate halloween
84-2_103.112_6.44.wav_ASR	um so we don't we t we typically we don't even give presents anymore
84-2_109.668_11.36.wav_ASR	oh b unfortunately both of the young ladies that my two sons married are both not ju
84-2_121.788_3.708.wav_ASR	one of them i think has no reflection which is fine with me
84-2_125.777_3.18.wav_ASR	and one of them i think is basically
84-2_130.297_4.6.wav_ASR	but um i think she likes celebrating haha as well
84-2_154.92_3.84.wav_ASR	the speech is probably the thing that i'm working on the most
84-2_159.16_7.84.wav_ASR	as you know i used to be a lawyer and i'd just i'd just gone back on active duty
84-2_167.46_3.07.wav_ASR	um so i can still be a lawyer if i want to be a lawyer
84-2_171.22_15.68.wav_ASR	but i'm i feel that a lot of times is especially with small words and pronouns and with um his and his and his and great with
84-2_187.36_3.34.wav_ASR	but that ha th that like i have to think for a while
84-2_190.722_2.64.wav_ASR	especially now that lower does mo
84-2_193.622_1.4.wav_ASR	or that all the drawings
84-2_195.302_2.954.wav_ASR	but i have to remember like which is left and which is right
84-2_198.782_1.54.wav_ASR	and feels is me some time
84-2_200.742_3.33.wav_ASR	and i'm i'm pretty good about backwards and forward
84-2_204.582_2.796.wav_ASR	and i'm hoping that i'll be able to drive it at some point
84-2_207.378_8.784.wav_ASR	it's not that i'm gonna write because i've never i i've always written a lot but i've never been i've always written a lot
84-2_216.44_9.7.wav_ASR	it just do it 'cause my white sits in the other seat and my m two kids when they are around um sometimes they would draw but sometimes they would draw a cat
84-2_227.22_6.2.wav_ASR	but um but um but now since my stroke my white does all the drawing
84-2_234.05_6.33.wav_ASR	and as i say i think maybe in a year or so i may be able to start writing again
84-2_240.74_0.76.wav_ASR	um i'm i'm not sure
84-2_247.16_2.58.wav_ASR	um don't tell my wife that but yes it's true
84-2_257.54_0.74.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
84-2_263.0_2.98.wav_ASR	oh yeah i r i remember my stroke pretty well
84-2_273.18_11.211.wav_ASR	well i was in the household for about eight days before i went to the rehab program which is also connected to um camus jasper and hass
84-2_285.39_20.682.wav_ASR	in that's where in my area of tone which is n near nine blocks from here we go down into jasper which is probably ten below about the same
84-2_306.65_15.44.wav_ASR	and i remember i remember i think i told you that on s today morning i went out to get i went out because there was a riot the night before from um the guy up and minutes
84-2_322.53_1.5.wav_ASR	forget his name right now
84-2_324.03_2.88.wav_ASR	um um so there's a huge rating
84-2_327.03_2.723.wav_ASR	we had a building actually burn here
84-2_330.29_4.617.wav_ASR	and i went out um i went out at about six o'clock in the morning to start cleaning up
84-2_335.07_2.209.wav_ASR	and i was one of the few people out there
84-2_337.63_2.1.wav_ASR	and i remember that being a turn of clock
84-2_339.843_5.105.wav_ASR	and um so i was there for about six to nine o'clock in the morning
84-2_345.103_1.957.wav_ASR	and then i went to get a news paper
84-2_347.387_0.994.wav_ASR	it didn't feel great
84-2_348.683_2.769.wav_ASR	oh a light light led down for a little bit
84-2_351.763_2.48.wav_ASR	and then i went to work in the afternoon
84-2_354.303_6.287.wav_ASR	and by the evening i was starting to feel oh a little worse but not terribly worse
84-2_361.05_2.15.wav_ASR	and i went to bed a round ten
84-2_364.003_2.577.wav_ASR	and i had my stroke in the middle of the night
84-2_367.183_3.063.wav_ASR	and the morning my wife could not get a hold of me
84-2_370.723_2.645.wav_ASR	so we have a casing which came up and fall away
84-2_373.648_1.7.wav_ASR	and they took me to the half
84-2_375.668_2.58.wav_ASR	that's when i spend about eight days in the household
84-2_378.928_4.34.wav_ASR	because um because i was during coffee
84-2_383.468_2.537.wav_ASR	so i really didn't see anybody there
84-2_386.828_5.56.wav_ASR	and i had um it was difficult for me 'cause i feel thought my talking was not great
84-2_392.4_3.057.wav_ASR	and uh also it was it was just difficult for me
84-2_395.58_4.82.wav_ASR	so it was um i mean i must have watched t. v.
84-2_400.74_2.02.wav_ASR	and i i was in a room by myself
84-2_402.991_12.52.wav_ASR	and um essentially on a money night that about a week and a couple days later i went to a menu which is only about six blocks away
84-2_415.551_0.838.wav_ASR	it's pretty close
84-2_416.971_3.157.wav_ASR	um so that's when i stayed for three for months
84-2_430.74_2.047.wav_ASR	oh i've done a lot of things to try to get better
84-2_433.0_1.662.wav_ASR	uh i don't know if all that works but
84-2_435.24_3.841.wav_ASR	so i was in the half for for eight weeks
84-2_439.239_9.64.wav_ASR	and every day except the weekends i had um i had um i had oh a. t. and p. t.
84-2_449.599_1.36.wav_ASR	and then i also had speech
84-2_451.039_1.499.wav_ASR	that was totally in the morning
84-2_453.139_4.394.wav_ASR	and then in the afternoon i for a while i didn't do anything
84-2_457.533_3.458.wav_ASR	but then obviously i started going to art
84-2_461.433_4.9.wav_ASR	and i i i did some stuff but it wasn't really very good
84-2_467.093_6.865.wav_ASR	the i thought by the time i left there um i wasn't so sure i was gonna do it
84-2_474.15_7.18.wav_ASR	um so i tried it a little bit more at m. g. which is um where i go for output
84-2_481.83_0.958.wav_ASR	and it wasn't great
84-2_483.11_2.78.wav_ASR	soon they introduced a music project
84-2_486.65_2.184.wav_ASR	and i was always interested in singing
84-2_489.35_2.38.wav_ASR	but i don't sing a lot
84-2_491.79_3.961.wav_ASR	and i don't sing i'm afraid i don't always sing on key
84-2_496.23_1.816.wav_ASR	oh i thought it might be good
84-2_498.25_2.78.wav_ASR	so i took some singing lessons which i still take
84-2_501.63_4.7.wav_ASR	and then also at template um there's an fave uh programme
84-2_506.586_10.4.wav_ASR	and so there's a singing programme there which i think i like better because i get real sounds and instead of made up sounds at m. g.
84-2_517.118_19.5.wav_ASR	and i also um uh on a on a um we're on something called impact where we try to do stuff to help people learn about a phase uh and um see see how we can help other people who have a phase
84-2_563.78_6.71.wav_ASR	well i have a lot of good experiences 'cause i've had a pretty positive life
84-2_570.49_11.14.wav_ASR	but i spent up until first grade i went to school in a suburb of cleveland and cleveland of Cleveland
84-2_582.166_13.72.wav_ASR	and then between my between my first and second grade years i moved to school and w was in a really nice sub group there called
84-2_596.144_6.909.wav_ASR	and um so growing up by i i i i was participating in a lot of different things
84-2_603.184_3.92.wav_ASR	it was not a great altitude but i was an okay enough half
84-2_607.264_4.74.wav_ASR	oh i usually m make it the last player on the team the second last player on the team
84-2_612.29_4.45.wav_ASR	and i really like playing hockey which we did out doors in the tent
84-2_617.81_12.14.wav_ASR	the um so i would say i learned a lot of experience from h. k. just um just ab ab ab about the game and about you know how to set up different play
84-2_630.86_17.583.wav_ASR	and apparently um obviously when i was in my what's called the um myantel which is fourteen and fifteen i was made captain of the team
84-2_648.56_1.971.wav_ASR	that was a really nice ant for me
84-2_650.531_4.636.wav_ASR	and i was um and it was a good time for me
84-2_655.371_2.836.wav_ASR	uh my i was on the p. team i was not on the team
84-2_658.411_5.549.wav_ASR	but um but there's enough players on the beep team that i would pretty friendly with
84-2_664.191_1.68.wav_ASR	and all of them were form factor
84-2_666.031_2.66.wav_ASR	so it was uh the nokia in north fee
84-2_668.951_1.04.wav_ASR	is it in the battery
84-2_670.145_2.671.wav_ASR	so it was really nice to meet all the people
84-2_673.365_10.54.wav_ASR	and we would have games um basically for layout and from layout to
84-2_684.865_2.36.wav_ASR	oh it was just nice to get to know some people
84-2_693.81_2.2.wav_ASR	uh i did get it in half a minute
84-2_696.361_5.44.wav_ASR	uh broke my um i broke my colour but
84-2_706.07_1.072.wav_ASR	it isn't that big
84-2_710.85_1.037.wav_ASR	it it can be
84-2_712.13_2.397.wav_ASR	but um it isn't bad for me
84-2_714.67_2.22.wav_ASR	maybe it wasn't a perfectly bad
84-2_717.63_4.6.wav_ASR	but i remember w i came home and i still wasn't feeling great
84-2_722.231_11.86.wav_ASR	so my dad took me to um what was then called evan's and household which is now part of northern
84-2_735.0_4.82.wav_ASR	and so um i remember i did some extras and some other thing
84-2_740.071_1.66.wav_ASR	they said i had a broken colour
84-2_741.98_7.66.wav_ASR	so i um i was i i think i th you know i think i b i actually broke my colour bond
84-2_751.48_1.24.wav_ASR	maybe it was only one
84-2_753.1_1.699.wav_ASR	then i also broke my wrist
84-2_755.56_1.969.wav_ASR	uh can't remember exactly how i did that
84-2_765.892_4.149.wav_ASR	yeah yeah you you can't have a um you can't have a catch on that
84-2_776.028_1.013.wav_ASR	it
84-2_777.152_1.08.wav_ASR	you play it
84-2_781.243_1.08.wav_ASR	oh well
84-2_785.063_2.76.wav_ASR	ah yeah so did d did you do that in colour too
84-2_797.763_0.72.wav_ASR	oh good
84-2_845.89_2.26.wav_ASR	oh yes that's the same thing we saw last
84-2_858.01_2.94.wav_ASR	so it's the story of a young man
84-2_861.0_5.48.wav_ASR	it would say he's a round twelve years old kicking a soccer ball
84-2_867.26_13.14.wav_ASR	uh i guess one of the armin kicks went through a plate glass window and landed next to someone who is probably either reading or maybe watching t. v.
84-2_880.69_3.33.wav_ASR	and so he saw the ball coming at him
84-2_884.43_10.34.wav_ASR	and he no he noticed that a lamp had a lamp had to rest uh um beside him
84-2_895.09_3.248.wav_ASR	and i could see i could see the ball coming at him
84-2_898.338_2.865.wav_ASR	so he might have cost the ball
84-2_902.03_2.001.wav_ASR	and he wasn't sure what to do
84-2_904.138_2.02.wav_ASR	so he said that the glass is broken
84-2_906.678_4.26.wav_ASR	so we went over to the window to see what had happened
84-2_911.418_4.592.wav_ASR	and i'm assuming that he saw the person who kicked the soccer ball
84-2_916.01_6.4.wav_ASR	but the then perhaps but by then perhaps the person with the slogan ball has run away
84-2_930.177_7.24.wav_ASR	um so it's the story of a young boy who was on his way to school
84-2_938.237_5.22.wav_ASR	and um he wasn't sure that he needed an bulb
84-2_943.61_7.119.wav_ASR	so he decided th that he wouldn't take an hour but it maybe didn't look like it was gonna run
84-2_951.25_5.94.wav_ASR	but as soon as he stepped out side and started walking a little bit the range came down
84-2_957.89_1.84.wav_ASR	he went back to his house
84-2_959.73_4.444.wav_ASR	and i he was oh all he was all dead
84-2_964.39_3.26.wav_ASR	and his mother had a strange look on his face
84-2_967.95_1.755.wav_ASR	but there was nothing he could do
84-2_969.89_4.927.wav_ASR	so he got some new clothes and went back out into the range
84-2_975.35_1.92.wav_ASR	this time he had an opportunity
84-2_988.79_6.25.wav_ASR	this is the picture of a young lady who had a cat stuck up in a tree
84-2_995.279_8.66.wav_ASR	so he's got off his triangle and s so i think what must have been his dad
84-2_1004.61_2.312.wav_ASR	his dad claimed up the three
84-2_1007.139_3.56.wav_ASR	and then the later broke and fell to the ground
84-2_1011.04_7.14.wav_ASR	there is a a poppy who's trying to see if maybe the man or the could come down
84-2_1018.34_18.709.wav_ASR	but sh he he was up there and needed to be removed by the fighter department who came to get the cat down
84-2_1188.82_0.522.wav_ASR	got you
84-2_1190.29_11.04.wav_ASR	well so this is a story about sender and his two s i think there were probably steps and his um
84-2_1202.87_5.93.wav_ASR	um so i believe that signal uh needed some help
84-2_1208.85_10.08.wav_ASR	and since she was um on her own she was able to get a jump with the two steps and the step
84-2_1219.6_12.86.wav_ASR	and she was doing a lot of stuff like washing the clothes and cleaning the um cleaning the floor and doing stuff like that and probably also doing the laundry
84-2_1233.61_13.66.wav_ASR	and it came to pass that there was a price who lived in the castle with his father and mother and perhaps some sisters and brothers
84-2_1247.87_7.51.wav_ASR	and sh he was looking for somebody to follow and love with
84-2_1255.91_10.09.wav_ASR	so they everybody in the town got an invitation to this big party that they were gonna have
84-2_1266.0_7.976.wav_ASR	so the two stepisters dress up in fine clothes and the mother went with them
84-2_1273.976_12.38.wav_ASR	and they were they went to the the the the price the the the the price the king was looking for
84-2_1286.996_3.0.wav_ASR	and so sh he decided to have this party
84-2_1290.119_5.02.wav_ASR	and um so they were they were at the party
84-2_1295.299_12.78.wav_ASR	and then a very god but came along and said to the young one simula that signal uh should go to the party too
84-2_1308.226_9.88.wav_ASR	so he she was able to get a dress and some nice clothing including a some beautiful shoes
84-2_1319.006_8.0.wav_ASR	and they were they were in some how invited to the meeting
84-2_1327.231_10.9.wav_ASR	and they came to the meeting and a special charger which had a rider and i think of uh someone who is in the back
84-2_1338.211_7.36.wav_ASR	and they came out at the at the um that the stereo at the party
84-2_1345.673_6.279.wav_ASR	and um the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the
84-2_1352.133_2.54.wav_ASR	and the print
84-2_1355.293_3.02.wav_ASR	and they had a very good time
84-2_1358.335_10.88.wav_ASR	but the print had the the the the the the the the the the that she needed to be held that she needed to be home by mid
84-2_1370.035_5.014.wav_ASR	so as the clock struck twelve she knew she had to get out
84-2_1375.049_3.707.wav_ASR	so he left and left the print there
84-2_1378.756_17.48.wav_ASR	and as he went out to the camera that the price that i uh like a service
84-2_1396.299_11.02.wav_ASR	hey um yeah and um the press print was really up set about what had happened
84-2_1407.593_17.28.wav_ASR	so she he sent some people from his from his from his his like his word is some people from his class to go out and see if they could find
84-2_1425.678_6.62.wav_ASR	and so she went to he went to different hours and could not find anyb
84-2_1432.618_11.82.wav_ASR	when he went to the house where the two capsisters lived sh she was wanting to know if anybody else was there
84-2_1444.93_13.02.wav_ASR	and somehow i think maybe he figured out that the that the young lady who is in the other room
84-2_1458.25_1.72.wav_ASR	so he brought up signal
84-2_1460.57_2.92.wav_ASR	and the shoes
84-2_1463.42_8.56.wav_ASR	so he went back to the print and told him about this person
84-2_1472.66_6.16.wav_ASR	and eventually the person became close again with the print
84-2_1480.57_3.74.wav_ASR	and and in the end the print and signal that got material
84-2_1514.01_3.94.wav_ASR	oh i don't remember what i talked about last week
84-2_1518.63_6.689.wav_ASR	um so there was always a clock in my house growing up
84-2_1526.11_3.865.wav_ASR	uh so i i knew pretty easily what time it was
84-2_1530.23_1.698.wav_ASR	oh i think i know the story
84-2_1531.9_8.72.wav_ASR	and so i remember uh specially in the history that there wasn't really any time i had to be home
84-2_1541.12_5.3.wav_ASR	so my parents said that you know when you get home it's fine
84-2_1546.84_4.825.wav_ASR	um you know obviously not too late but you know you you wanna have a good time
84-2_1551.665_5.02.wav_ASR	so especially on friday and Saturday nights we use to go out we
84-2_1556.735_4.043.wav_ASR	you have to d triple in one of my friends' basement and then go out
84-2_1561.105_4.17.wav_ASR	and um so we would go to different parts which was a lot of fun
84-2_1565.275_7.34.wav_ASR	but i always made it home except one time i actually felt a sleep at the wheel
84-2_1573.075_7.54.wav_ASR	but i was um i was in the p i was b i was driving
84-2_1580.922_5.48.wav_ASR	somebody else name one of my friends who is named t. ball was in the other
84-2_1587.065_3.064.wav_ASR	and um he he yellow that me
84-2_1590.202_0.83.wav_ASR	now i walk up
84-2_1591.802_1.28.wav_ASR	but it was in the top
84-2_1593.302_0.94.wav_ASR	so nothing happen
84-2_1594.562_1.16.wav_ASR	ah it was pretty lucky
84-2_1595.743_6.552.wav_ASR	um so i guess it sh it's good to know that a clock is always there noting what time it is
84-2_1602.295_18.18.wav_ASR	and hopefully um you know i n i i i d w then when i was in college i used to i d i d in um in janus uh channel worth and in um
84-2_1621.213_5.323.wav_ASR	and so i had a jump that started at six o'clock and the morning during the summer
84-2_1626.636_8.781.wav_ASR	so i used to s stay out with my friends or at my college friends' house until about until four in the morning and then go to work
84-2_1635.473_3.123.wav_ASR	or i would come home and get my bite and then go to work
84-2_1638.596_3.3.wav_ASR	so it was fun but it was also pretty excess
84-2_1661.747_12.78.wav_ASR	uh i think the only thing i can say about birds is that um growing up i pretty took pr pretty much took birds for granted
84-2_1674.744_11.46.wav_ASR	and i remember even when i was in um underwear and when i went to a low scale i d i mean i never really thought about power
84-2_1686.85_16.941.wav_ASR	but as i as i as i w i guess i should say that i g well i w i w i guess i should say that i worked a lot in when i was in um when i was a lawyer
84-2_1703.791_4.937.wav_ASR	and then i went to uh a company um where i was for a long time
84-2_1709.271_8.12.wav_ASR	but now that i'm now that i'm looking for stuff to do one of the things i'm pretty interested in doing is bridge wire
84-2_1718.071_2.377.wav_ASR	so it's something i'm gonna try to do
84-2_1720.448_13.26.wav_ASR	uh i'm sure i told you but maybe i didn't that my that me in my wife for gonna move to south america and in the communication there where i feel i can do some bird watch
84-2_1734.128_1.611.wav_ASR	so i'd like to try it
84-2_1735.948_1.252.wav_ASR	uh hope i'm good at it
84-2_1737.348_1.265.wav_ASR	oh i hope i know what i'm doing
84-2_1738.613_8.402.wav_ASR	but it's um important for me to find some habits that i can work on and try to get feel feel good about it
84-2_1751.233_2.428.wav_ASR	oh oh we already picked the place
84-2_1753.973_1.755.wav_ASR	cheerio
84-2_1755.813_0.848.wav_ASR	everybit there
84-2_1757.804_3.6.wav_ASR	and it's off the cost um
84-2_1763.495_4.149.wav_ASR	about forty minutes from the chocolate and apple
84-2_1768.604_1.36.wav_ASR	and it's a beauty
84-2_1772.244_3.34.wav_ASR	oh i don't wanna go into too much detail
84-2_1775.781_12.445.wav_ASR	but um we we we're constructing a place there that's part of a dimension that's right on the beach
84-2_1788.901_5.343.wav_ASR	and so um so i my wife is down there right now
84-2_1794.244_5.8.wav_ASR	oh so she could actually go into the building which is being cons
84-2_1800.532_16.3.wav_ASR	and she was able to tell me that from my from where our consultant is place my wife says that she can actually see the speech you know for the oath
84-2_1817.192_13.006.wav_ASR	oh for me that was really nice because i've always my i used to have a place in the office man which my r white really like that i don't like so much it
84-2_1830.198_1.1.wav_ASR	it's the led on the bottom
84-2_1831.912_4.94.wav_ASR	and so now i feel that i've been able to give something you know
84-2_1837.124_5.433.wav_ASR	some i wanted to find a place that would be good for her
84-2_1843.004_3.038.wav_ASR	and i think i mean it's gonna be a little hot for me
84-2_1846.364_6.04.wav_ASR	but i think it's gonna be worth it um because it's gonna be a great place for my wife
84-2_1861.804_4.88.wav_ASR	yeah little head it is in is it's an sort of a colour
84-2_1868.964_0.303.wav_ASR	oh
84-2_1877.712_1.04.wav_ASR	well it's pretty conc
84-2_1879.112_1.64.wav_ASR	and i'm not very concervative so
84-2_1882.912_1.763.wav_ASR	it it that i think it should be good
84-2_1885.012_4.164.wav_ASR	um we know some people down there who live there
84-2_1889.212_1.86.wav_ASR	so that's gonna be really helpful too
84-2_1891.217_9.274.wav_ASR	but the per uh the p person i know really well made a formation in um in a company that he was in
84-2_1900.657_4.7.wav_ASR	oh he has a lot of places now all over the world including
84-2_1929.085_7.92.wav_ASR	well probably the whole hell i stayed in some nice hotel
84-2_1937.925_5.3.wav_ASR	but probably the nicest hotel i stayed in was for my reading
84-2_1943.216_11.64.wav_ASR	um i married uh a a a last student um when i was in law school who um lived in washington d. c.
84-2_1955.736_3.62.wav_ASR	so we got married at the four seasons a total and jordan
84-2_1960.256_1.29.wav_ASR	that was a real nice place
84-2_1961.546_2.702.wav_ASR	so we we were able to be there for a couple of days
84-2_1964.566_2.56.wav_ASR	we had a fair amount of a people at our meeting
84-2_1967.137_1.529.wav_ASR	think it was about two hundred
84-2_1969.686_5.86.wav_ASR	the um w we were able to have a editing on a standard after
84-2_1976.586_2.56.wav_ASR	and um we had a nice lunch
84-2_1979.209_12.504.wav_ASR	and then i remember that m many of my friends went down to a bar um further down in in jordan town and with my wife and some friends and had a nice meeting there
84-2_1992.089_1.731.wav_ASR	oh for me it was a good place
84-2_1994.369_2.18.wav_ASR	um but truly i like being home
84-2_1996.549_3.359.wav_ASR	so i you know i did it
84-2_1999.989_0.545.wav_ASR	that was good
84-2_2000.709_3.348.wav_ASR	it you know i like being where i am now
84-2_2196.154_4.351.wav_ASR	well i think i told you about my favourite restaurant in the new world great
84-2_2200.505_1.925.wav_ASR	one that i want to for about twenty years
84-2_2204.4_1.8.wav_ASR	oh i won't talk about that
84-2_2206.653_12.64.wav_ASR	um well here in philosophy i've got to know a f a few rational uh i've got to know a f a few rational
84-2_2219.853_5.936.wav_ASR	so i lived here when i first when i first took a job
84-2_2225.789_3.92.wav_ASR	uh i was a lot cool for a judge and television
84-2_2230.669_3.36.wav_ASR	and then i lived here for a while before i moved to print station
84-2_2234.197_14.716.wav_ASR	but one of the places i like to eat a lot is a restaurant called porky a. r. c. r.
84-2_2249.537_1.139.wav_ASR	and i don't know why
84-2_2250.676_4.494.wav_ASR	but um i used to be able to speak french pretty well
84-2_2255.756_5.814.wav_ASR	and i like going there because they have a lot of good food
84-2_2262.196_5.2.wav_ASR	most of which is again two it's got to be over price like so many reset
84-2_2267.49_9.604.wav_ASR	but one thing i really like there is my um my ha uh they have a hammer that's really nice
84-2_2277.79_5.42.wav_ASR	it's it's it can be it can be it can be cut different ways
84-2_2283.415_9.06.wav_ASR	and i like my meat very very um uh not cook not completely cook but cook most of the way
84-2_2293.155_8.88.wav_ASR	um it's a really nice place to get a g. c. battery and either a scale or some um some french
84-2_2302.33_4.163.wav_ASR	so if if the french fries are usually for my wife
84-2_2307.01_2.4.wav_ASR	so i usually wind up getting a sa a sa
84-2_2309.77_7.26.wav_ASR	but sometimes she makes me order the the um he she makes me order the
84-2_2336.29_0.91.wav_ASR	oh we had this too
84-2_2337.64_6.1.wav_ASR	well the pinnup button for me is pretty easy to
84-2_2344.78_4.14.wav_ASR	it goes to the most the my bread is in the freezer
84-2_2349.56_2.46.wav_ASR	so i take out two pieces of red
84-2_2352.03_13.906.wav_ASR	um i like a particular kind of um python button that is made at um canvas which has nothing but penguins in it
84-2_2365.936_10.164.wav_ASR	and so i usually put one i have a pittun battery cell which later has been uh according a little more frequently for some reason i don't know
84-2_2376.676_2.695.wav_ASR	um and then i'll take just about any channel
84-2_2379.371_10.336.wav_ASR	but i found a yellow at um i think that um wiggen that has three different types of fruit in it
84-2_2389.5_27.09.wav_ASR	and so i put that with some um w a b a type of beep red that i find to be to be very good
84-2_2416.69_4.042.wav_ASR	so i'm i'm i'm gonna have a schedule a little later today
84-2_2420.83_1.92.wav_ASR	and i'm probably gonna have a turtle so
84-2_2423.13_2.155.wav_ASR	but yeah i like p. n. button and yellow a lot
84-2_2425.63_8.46.wav_ASR	uh i got the i've got the i've got the i've got the canvas down to a size
84-2_2440.382_15.965.wav_ASR	well we i think i may have told you that we used to limit the hell
84-2_2456.416_4.325.wav_ASR	but we found somebody that we thought we could sell it to
84-2_2460.976_7.3.wav_ASR	and it turned out that he sh the two of them bought it at a price that i think was pretty good
84-2_2468.485_11.2.wav_ASR	so while we're waiting for the place to be built in um c. r. uh we've moved it turns out across the hall where there's a remote unit
84-2_2479.5_13.0.wav_ASR	and so and there's a washer and a dryer with all the with all the um with all the all the
84-2_2493.08_0.68.wav_ASR	the rooms
84-2_2494.18_4.5.wav_ASR	all the locations i guess you could say have a wireless in a drawer
84-2_2499.03_7.61.wav_ASR	so usually there may be a couple of clothes that may go to the white clean
84-2_2506.81_8.7.wav_ASR	but for the most part i will um i will open the i will open the
84-2_2516.541_5.6.wav_ASR	it's a washer that works it it applies from the side
84-2_2522.721_4.203.wav_ASR	so i put all the clothes in which is something i'm still able to do
84-2_2527.541_5.5.wav_ASR	and um then i will turn on the wash
84-2_2533.721_1.86.wav_ASR	usually it's on a cold side
84-2_2535.923_4.6.wav_ASR	and once it starts moving a little bit i put in the
84-2_2541.603_5.972.wav_ASR	and for some reason this this water takes a long time
84-2_2548.263_2.18.wav_ASR	uh in about an hour it's done
84-2_2550.963_2.58.wav_ASR	the clothes have always come up pretty clean
84-2_2553.677_3.5.wav_ASR	so i then put them in the draft
84-2_2558.157_3.06.wav_ASR	and that's about another forty five
84-2_2561.777_10.454.wav_ASR	but usually th within two hours um the clothes come out and they're ready to be folded it which for me takes a while 'cause i only have the one hand
84-2_2572.231_6.68.wav_ASR	so one i tried to do is just limit the stuff that i like the stuff that goes in my class
84-2_2579.691_1.311.wav_ASR	and lower is that her own
84-2_2582.091_6.46.wav_ASR	yeah she sh uh sh her clothes get washed with mine but i can't really put them away
84-2_2588.911_1.977.wav_ASR	she's got a lot more clothing than i do
84-2_2605.921_5.7.wav_ASR	well i i grew up with a lot of flowers
84-2_2612.441_6.897.wav_ASR	but somehow when i married lower that was not one of the things that she was really interested in
84-2_2619.338_7.26.wav_ASR	so we have a lot we we have a few not a lot of phases around our appointment
84-2_2627.098_3.1.wav_ASR	but um i had a budget in march
84-2_2630.778_6.74.wav_ASR	and um one of the people i become very close with is a personal trainer name gene
84-2_2637.618_7.84.wav_ASR	and so um g. has been with me for i think now for about two and a half years
84-2_2645.678_7.36.wav_ASR	and she got a small plate for me that is the only limiting part in this apart
84-2_2654.178_0.9.wav_ASR	and for some reason
84-2_2655.359_3.54.wav_ASR	but i got it at the end of
84-2_2661.499_3.353.wav_ASR	and for some reason the plan is still chucking along
84-2_2664.959_0.989.wav_ASR	it's do an pretty well
84-2_2666.159_8.647.wav_ASR	oh i feel good that i can keep a plan now for what is it um four months
84-2_2681.403_5.463.wav_ASR	uh i think the biggest success is is that i don't have to water it very often
84-2_2689.146_3.773.wav_ASR	but i can show it to you but i don't know what it is
84-2_2692.919_6.577.wav_ASR	maybe at the end if we have enough time i'll see if i can see it
84-2_2699.679_5.76.wav_ASR	but it it i it's it's hard for me to see 'cause it's on the window
84-2_2707.71_1.15.wav_ASR	oh the you're on blank
84-2_2725.24_2.756.wav_ASR	well find the easy ones to start with

54-2_1616.929_2.49.wav_ASR	oh the
54-2_1620.075_18.62.wav_ASR	yeah
54-2_1639.995_16.1.wav_ASR	yeah
54-2_1707.904_0.46.wav_ASR	oh
54-2_1725.348_1.31.wav_ASR	oh
54-2_1726.827_1.6.wav_ASR	yeah
54-2_1730.244_10.67.wav_ASR	okay
54-2_1741.845_10.65.wav_ASR	yeah
54-2_1753.84_1.44.wav_ASR	yeah
54-2_1763.277_1.55.wav_ASR	oh no
54-2_1766.343_7.69.wav_ASR	yeah
54-2_1777.259_11.95.wav_ASR	yeah
54-2_1794.463_28.44.wav_ASR	yeah
54-2_1825.002_11.42.wav_ASR	yeah
54-2_1838.521_0.49.wav_ASR	oh
61-1_8.815_2.07.wav_ASR	um better than it has
61-1_11.161_1.12.wav_ASR	but it's not
61-1_18.98_0.59.wav_ASR	yes
61-1_25.037_0.33.wav_ASR	yeah
61-1_26.772_10.59.wav_ASR	um first of all i b i had um a sentence i had um a sentence i had um a sentence i had
61-1_37.381_1.15.wav_ASR	ah could speak
61-1_38.607_5.59.wav_ASR	and then as all somebody started speaking again
61-1_45.366_12.18.wav_ASR	and um i was two thirty seven um um ninety
61-1_58.751_15.99.wav_ASR	so so i asked to see the um go to the um um game else and go to the the
61-1_76.25_3.64.wav_ASR	and when i got there he couldn't find anything wrong with me
61-1_80.439_7.66.wav_ASR	but he he thought thought he would put me in um a place
61-1_88.709_1.3.wav_ASR	and they put me in
61-1_90.349_3.38.wav_ASR	they oh me up and did everything
61-1_95.155_1.83.wav_ASR	and i was doing fine
61-1_97.039_1.31.wav_ASR	uh i i thought
61-1_98.399_1.83.wav_ASR	and i was talking fine
61-1_100.966_6.14.wav_ASR	and um the document came in and was going to discuss me
61-1_107.936_1.9.wav_ASR	and i couldn't talk
61-1_111.68_0.89.wav_ASR	and so he goes
61-1_112.95_2.58.wav_ASR	ah i think you better stay
61-1_117.965_4.57.wav_ASR	and then um
61-1_123.467_9.27.wav_ASR	and um the nerves was supposed to help me go to the r re restoration but um she didn't
61-1_133.067_3.3.wav_ASR	and i went in to the research
61-1_136.391_1.53.wav_ASR	and i stumbled and fell
61-1_140.685_3.91.wav_ASR	and um they got me again
61-1_144.655_8.54.wav_ASR	uh and um they took me down to do another edit screen
61-1_154.705_13.28.wav_ASR	and then they looked me up to um a beard hair and draw me up to uh matthew's
61-1_169.781_4.37.wav_ASR	and um then it gives kind of like
61-1_174.309_2.62.wav_ASR	oh no for the remote control
61-1_178.661_5.2.wav_ASR	um i wasn't promoting much of anything
61-1_184.822_2.75.wav_ASR	and um they kept me over night
61-1_188.082_10.52.wav_ASR	and the next day i walk up and i w i i could s mostly uh talk but not very well
61-1_200.408_8.51.wav_ASR	and um i started having um um all kinds of trouble
61-1_226.007_5.97.wav_ASR	well i took i i was in review for four or five weeks
61-1_233.191_11.69.wav_ASR	and um i finally got to the point where i could al you know um walk with my walker
61-1_245.707_15.99.wav_ASR	and i could d um here i could i could speak more terms and m uh you know help me do better
61-1_262.172_3.67.wav_ASR	um i didn't have any cha movement of my arm
61-1_266.267_3.84.wav_ASR	the second screen
61-1_315.699_2.93.wav_ASR	and i did that for all a year
61-1_330.479_11.46.wav_ASR	um yeah i would i would um
61-1_349.383_4.85.wav_ASR	well she would help me with my um walking and my
61-1_356.687_5.12.wav_ASR	so um she worked one day a week with me on all those
61-1_362.665_17.62.wav_ASR	and then um i had three um um i don't know
61-1_380.9_21.52.wav_ASR	um as far as the p um as far as the um i didn't do any more um speech uh um speech anyway because the speech was gonna cost money
61-1_404.089_2.27.wav_ASR	and i don't have money
61-1_435.895_8.56.wav_ASR	and i went to um button for survey um for decision
61-1_445.985_13.32.wav_ASR	and i i thought really good about it because when i i was out i um take care of people
61-1_461.683_4.17.wav_ASR	and i worked at um campaign
61-1_467.67_6.41.wav_ASR	and i um we had uh lot of people
61-1_474.883_17.85.wav_ASR	and we um picked 'em up with medals and stuff um um physical therapy and um things like that
61-1_494.709_2.1.wav_ASR	so i i really enjoyed that
61-1_518.553_7.98.wav_ASR	well uh oh a boy is playing in
61-1_528.141_1.88.wav_ASR	um and he kick it
61-1_530.607_1.18.wav_ASR	and it hit the window
61-1_533.027_1.13.wav_ASR	and it came true
61-1_535.235_9.91.wav_ASR	and the guy was uh g i got up and looked at the window to see what hi what um cost the problem
61-1_576.326_1.63.wav_ASR	but the says
61-1_578.502_0.9.wav_ASR	it's gonna rain
61-1_580.406_8.01.wav_ASR	and i'm gonna give you a um uh um uh um
61-1_588.979_0.31.wav_ASR	and he's
61-1_589.931_1.01.wav_ASR	oh i don't want
61-1_592.076_3.31.wav_ASR	and so he walked and he walked
61-1_595.58_1.7.wav_ASR	and he was all dressed
61-1_598.168_0.88.wav_ASR	and he came oh
61-1_599.072_1.87.wav_ASR	and he was all red
61-1_601.589_1.22.wav_ASR	and his mom said
61-1_603.285_1.59.wav_ASR	you should have taken them bro
61-1_606.37_4.87.wav_ASR	and the so he took the animal and carried it out in the rain
61-1_632.32_7.8.wav_ASR	well there is a a cat that was uh up in tree
61-1_640.874_3.84.wav_ASR	and so the guy got up there to try to help get the cat
61-1_645.588_4.39.wav_ASR	there was a girl underneath c um catch it
61-1_651.054_4.93.wav_ASR	and then they call for the um
61-1_656.707_2.71.wav_ASR	and uh two guys with the b later case
61-1_659.432_3.79.wav_ASR	um the dog is kinda g yeah
61-1_663.272_13.78.wav_ASR	um um and then they would have helped him
61-1_678.744_4.75.wav_ASR	and they would um go back to the station
61-1_686.144_0.92.wav_ASR	is that what you want
61-1_919.524_12.68.wav_ASR	um was uh um was it needed in the company to take care of
61-1_932.962_5.86.wav_ASR	so these two um systems decided to take care of
61-1_939.695_14.76.wav_ASR	but they took and used her to find um their life by cleaning and cleaning and s um all that stuff
61-1_955.23_28.59.wav_ASR	and then the um uh a r uh r uh m uh r uh t to um allow them to go to this
61-1_984.421_9.68.wav_ASR	and um the bell said no to the signal and um yes to the two curves and um yes to the two curves
61-1_994.715_9.13.wav_ASR	and they got um a quit um
61-1_1003.869_16.48.wav_ASR	um and she was um re uh b oh r oh she would like to go but wasn't gonna be able
61-1_1094.545_5.59.wav_ASR	and uh she went to the cons um the um thing
61-1_1100.159_2.85.wav_ASR	and it was twelve and a half
61-1_1103.418_2.55.wav_ASR	and she was running up a s
61-1_1106.476_6.11.wav_ASR	and she dropped a one or a s slippery is it slippery
61-1_1113.602_8.23.wav_ASR	and um the um the um the um the um the um the um the um the um the um the um the um the um the um the um the um the um the um the um the um the um the um the um the
61-1_1121.847_4.94.wav_ASR	and uh that everybody is
61-1_1126.987_3.87.wav_ASR	and she was uh all aga aggs
61-1_1131.671_11.07.wav_ASR	and then um the um um guide came to try to hit on the show
61-1_1143.689_5.91.wav_ASR	and the the little curve uh that could fit it
61-1_1150.328_4.82.wav_ASR	and um finally um they should
61-1_1155.34_1.2.wav_ASR	but about
61-1_1157.179_0.93.wav_ASR	and they put it on
61-1_1159.019_6.12.wav_ASR	and um she um
61-1_1166.031_13.87.wav_ASR	and they um he should
61-1_1183.039_1.84.wav_ASR	that's best i could do
61-1_1195.099_2.02.wav_ASR	and i would take the bird out
61-1_1198.866_11.06.wav_ASR	and i would get a um a platter and put it on the plate
61-1_1210.828_7.54.wav_ASR	then i take a night and um
61-1_1292.54_1.55.wav_ASR	and then i would take the gel
61-1_1296.163_5.41.wav_ASR	and i would take it it and put it on the brat
61-1_1302.453_2.39.wav_ASR	and then i s slap the two pieces on the
61-1_1305.282_2.95.wav_ASR	and that's your bad you're um
61-1_1310.138_1.54.wav_ASR	that's the way you do it
61-2_7.316_0.44.wav_ASR	there
61-2_10.544_1.21.wav_ASR	it's not great
61-2_11.806_1.61.wav_ASR	but it l it it is far
61-2_19.88_0.6.wav_ASR	yes
61-2_25.748_4.71.wav_ASR	well um the o originally i was out
61-2_30.65_8.45.wav_ASR	um and i uh went uh into the um doctors
61-2_39.19_4.47.wav_ASR	and he got me at uh two s two thirty or something like that
61-2_44.66_3.26.wav_ASR	and um he asks me what i need
61-2_48.163_0.47.wav_ASR	ah i say
61-2_48.79_1.76.wav_ASR	like a um an email
61-2_51.378_7.99.wav_ASR	so you he put me on an amplitude send me to um a b household
61-2_60.401_2.05.wav_ASR	and i was fine
61-2_62.719_3.49.wav_ASR	and the but the b the um doctor said
61-2_66.37_3.15.wav_ASR	oh we'll keep you over night make sure you're okay
61-2_69.795_0.84.wav_ASR	that's it
61-2_70.795_0.89.wav_ASR	okay that's fine
61-2_72.453_6.66.wav_ASR	um and then i went back to my room
61-2_79.135_2.28.wav_ASR	um you know everything was fine
61-2_81.43_5.79.wav_ASR	and the next day um they got up and talk to the doctor
61-2_87.64_5.56.wav_ASR	and the doctor uh was talking to me and um ask me what i had plan
61-2_93.216_0.6.wav_ASR	and i said
61-2_94.173_2.0.wav_ASR	uh plan on
61-2_97.054_1.66.wav_ASR	and he said
61-2_98.874_0.39.wav_ASR	okay
61-2_99.933_2.66.wav_ASR	well y you're you're three to go
61-2_102.723_2.85.wav_ASR	and uh by that time i started
61-2_109.311_2.19.wav_ASR	and uh he goes
61-2_112.605_3.12.wav_ASR	okay you need to get back in the bag
61-2_117.129_6.61.wav_ASR	and um then uh later i'm i um got up to p.
61-2_124.736_3.38.wav_ASR	and i stumbled and fell
61-2_129.151_0.991.wav_ASR	and they took me
61-2_130.342_5.491.wav_ASR	and they took me um they took some more p pictures
61-2_136.632_14.78.wav_ASR	and they put me on a um flight and um flickens
61-2_156.113_14.58.wav_ASR	it's uh me the r oh no
61-2_173.308_2.5.wav_ASR	um and then they brought me in
61-2_176.256_7.46.wav_ASR	and uh then um i kinda s was in and out in an hour and a half
61-2_184.691_2.92.wav_ASR	and um finally i walked up
61-2_188.628_5.23.wav_ASR	and uh they told me they were gonna keep me for a couple days
61-2_193.939_3.48.wav_ASR	and then i'll put put in an um inspection
61-2_197.442_5.16.wav_ASR	and um they move me too
61-2_205.991_4.68.wav_ASR	and they reha uh well probably three bl uh three weeks
61-2_212.155_6.19.wav_ASR	um and i got better
61-2_218.937_4.47.wav_ASR	but uh you know i uh it's slow
61-2_224.256_0.67.wav_ASR	that's all
61-2_238.905_4.33.wav_ASR	well i started walking
61-2_244.59_3.18.wav_ASR	and i kept walking uh more and more all the time
61-2_248.655_2.36.wav_ASR	um i kinda thought
61-2_251.999_6.4.wav_ASR	but um and it would it could me start it on
61-2_259.233_4.67.wav_ASR	um i still w stumble across the it's a word
61-2_265.159_2.74.wav_ASR	uh i don't have them very well
61-2_268.961_4.7.wav_ASR	but um and uh i b i'd played the drums
61-2_276.752_6.1.wav_ASR	um and i i s i uh i uh i constantly am going on that
61-2_290.311_0.49.wav_ASR	ah i don't know
61-2_312.631_20.68.wav_ASR	ah a um a um a baby um a baby boy
61-2_334.79_5.55.wav_ASR	and he uh is twenty now or eighteen eighteen now
61-2_341.112_6.12.wav_ASR	um and uh and i watched him grow up
61-2_348.626_9.2.wav_ASR	and i married my n future wife when he was um little
61-2_357.88_10.47.wav_ASR	and um that's uh i i don't know
61-2_368.75_3.61.wav_ASR	that's about good is to get it
61-2_397.213_9.31.wav_ASR	um the guy was playing with the ball about side
61-2_407.038_1.3.wav_ASR	and it went through the window
61-2_408.392_4.23.wav_ASR	oh and in a script for the screen
61-2_412.64_11.73.wav_ASR	um and then um uh this last one i don't have
61-2_489.721_0.57.wav_ASR	yeah
61-2_511.574_10.34.wav_ASR	let's see
61-2_529.275_8.57.wav_ASR	um and he's looking out the window with the ball trying to find out who's who sent it
61-2_562.372_1.88.wav_ASR	he is ready to go to school
61-2_564.954_17.9.wav_ASR	and she gives him um a um
61-2_590.232_0.92.wav_ASR	and he said
61-2_591.359_1.31.wav_ASR	oh i don't need it
61-2_592.693_2.57.wav_ASR	the and the in the front and
61-2_595.285_4.08.wav_ASR	and it ran on him all the way to school
61-2_599.389_4.1.wav_ASR	oh let me go home he was all red stained
61-2_604.479_2.94.wav_ASR	and she said
61-2_608.327_1.49.wav_ASR	maybe you'll take this
61-2_610.627_0.96.wav_ASR	and need to
61-2_633.612_8.38.wav_ASR	that's um our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our
61-2_643.054_2.25.wav_ASR	so should call for this man
61-2_645.321_1.57.wav_ASR	and he he would now
61-2_647.972_1.11.wav_ASR	and he couldn't get it
61-2_650.287_3.04.wav_ASR	and the dog was breaking
61-2_655.342_10.2.wav_ASR	and so um uh the well he he um draw a um ladder
61-2_667.92_4.85.wav_ASR	so they called the bu uh um
61-2_673.853_6.59.wav_ASR	and the he came over to get the cat and the g b the man out of the chair a three
61-2_682.078_3.83.wav_ASR	yeah and uh then they went back to the place
61-2_864.537_2.61.wav_ASR	signal uh was um by himself
61-2_867.296_11.2.wav_ASR	so he um they uh made the um zap there and the um zaps part of the family
61-2_879.336_3.01.wav_ASR	and they um took serial and
61-2_882.705_22.8.wav_ASR	and they made her um put on dresses um um the constant um um um the constant um
61-2_916.856_1.52.wav_ASR	should take care of the animal
61-2_919.802_13.32.wav_ASR	and then uh she was s slowly looking out over the um s the um place and see in the c the um place and stuff
61-2_934.084_27.1.wav_ASR	and then um one day the sky came and was the s um
61-2_962.47_9.66.wav_ASR	he was trying to get all the b um colours to um sample uh for the um palm
61-2_973.421_21.39.wav_ASR	and um you know uh the um the step um that um flahmans for the two curves for the two curves
61-2_994.832_2.06.wav_ASR	and they got draw
61-2_997.214_5.14.wav_ASR	and um and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and uh and
61-2_1002.377_1.05.wav_ASR	oh but she couldn't
61-2_1003.45_3.84.wav_ASR	oh and she was kind of a b description
61-2_1008.174_1.78.wav_ASR	and she was uh in her room
61-2_1010.688_16.29.wav_ASR	and this um stepmother came and got her um godfather came and got her
61-2_1027.539_0.319.wav_ASR	let's see
61-2_1028.31_1.759.wav_ASR	oh i can dress you
61-2_1068.742_4.94.wav_ASR	and she dances with a um guy
61-2_1074.268_1.95.wav_ASR	and it was twelve and a half
61-2_1076.682_3.41.wav_ASR	and she knew she had to get it oh out of uh everything
61-2_1080.573_3.49.wav_ASR	and she ran down my streets
61-2_1084.082_9.4.wav_ASR	and one on the s um sliders um sliders on the screen
61-2_1094.646_19.6.wav_ASR	and she um was oh um
61-2_1122.02_9.76.wav_ASR	 anyway um this guy brought this slider and tried it on and tried it on and tried it on and tried it on and tried it on and tried it on and tried it on and tried it on
61-2_1131.881_2.15.wav_ASR	and they wouldn't take it
61-2_1134.685_2.0.wav_ASR	and um he goes
61-2_1136.941_1.73.wav_ASR	is there anybody else here
61-2_1139.472_1.83.wav_ASR	and she said
61-2_1141.485_1.46.wav_ASR	yeah i'm here
61-2_1143.285_1.33.wav_ASR	and she came down
61-2_1144.667_2.04.wav_ASR	and she tried to s flip it on
61-2_1146.731_0.75.wav_ASR	and the chip
61-2_1148.031_1.74.wav_ASR	and they got
61-2_1155.391_0.75.wav_ASR	that was bad
61-2_1168.88_15.37.wav_ASR	well i get the bread out the um sandwich uh and the yellow and a plate
61-2_1185.951_26.34.wav_ASR	and i would um take out the um um the um on the um the um the um thing
61-2_1212.967_21.03.wav_ASR	and then i would uh take and i would open up the um
61-2_1244.515_1.62.wav_ASR	oh
61-2_1246.458_8.04.wav_ASR	and i slap it down there and make a nice pl place
61-2_1255.095_4.45.wav_ASR	then i'd take and i'd opened the um the yellow
61-2_1260.149_0.92.wav_ASR	like take it
61-2_1261.114_1.58.wav_ASR	you know slap it on
61-2_1262.716_24.17.wav_ASR	and then i would move um i would move the um the yellow
61-2_1295.387_2.41.wav_ASR	and then i'd have a sample
63-1_9.307_7.12.wav_ASR	well most of the time some time i i know it
63-1_18.203_0.77.wav_ASR	that's what it is
63-1_19.278_6.63.wav_ASR	oh i can't get it out it all i'm till uh i'm told what it is
63-1_25.929_1.77.wav_ASR	isn't then i get right to it
63-1_33.892_1.35.wav_ASR	oh the first one
63-1_35.39_2.45.wav_ASR	yeah i yeah i got up
63-1_37.885_1.22.wav_ASR	oh want to the bath
63-1_40.367_2.43.wav_ASR	and the next thing i thought
63-1_42.974_1.5.wav_ASR	that was a nightmare at the time
63-1_45.174_9.36.wav_ASR	next thing i know i was in oh a thing in uh which you told
63-1_54.991_2.02.wav_ASR	so i it's but
63-1_57.497_4.18.wav_ASR	uh uh there is a lot of things i never knew what i had
63-1_62.232_10.1.wav_ASR	uh i was i was in which uh i mean an a little for but i don't know s three two three week
63-1_72.348_8.15.wav_ASR	and then i was next time uh i was in uh in workshop
63-1_80.927_1.09.wav_ASR	so i don't know
63-1_95.089_7.61.wav_ASR	well uh when i was in this one place
63-1_102.782_2.88.wav_ASR	uh wha what would it
63-1_105.685_4.02.wav_ASR	uh um i i can't remember
63-1_110.409_1.76.wav_ASR	but i did a lot of work in
63-1_112.828_7.07.wav_ASR	had a lot of accessories other than uh uh screen
63-1_120.492_2.44.wav_ASR	ah th they were doing something to me
63-1_123.701_2.83.wav_ASR	the l li list of the next slide
63-1_148.618_8.52.wav_ASR	well i i uh other from uh you know get get married and oh i think the one of the best things i ever did
63-1_157.162_5.04.wav_ASR	and it was oh about twenty or so
63-1_162.226_11.69.wav_ASR	oh i mean oh w when i was in the in the air force i played a lot of ball and a lot of base uh put ball
63-1_174.727_4.44.wav_ASR	and uh i had a wonderful time doing that
63-1_179.46_1.02.wav_ASR	oh wonderful time
63-1_180.54_1.2.wav_ASR	ah played bass
63-1_182.282_1.16.wav_ASR	ah played good bob
63-1_184.226_3.1.wav_ASR	but full ball is my the same
63-1_187.349_4.87.wav_ASR	uh i i i i'll i'll i'll i'll i'll i'll i'll i'll i'll i'll i'll
63-1_192.234_2.13.wav_ASR	and i i i got a lot of fun
63-1_194.426_2.4.wav_ASR	nei that would be the one in my best thing
63-1_215.891_8.0.wav_ASR	he kick the ball
63-1_224.379_7.11.wav_ASR	the the the the ball
63-1_231.786_1.23.wav_ASR	it went into the hell
63-1_234.185_1.24.wav_ASR	the gadgets side
63-1_236.68_11.58.wav_ASR	and he won't give it bad because of the because uh the ball being oh uh
63-1_249.3_1.41.wav_ASR	he he
63-1_251.228_0.85.wav_ASR	it went into the
63-1_252.096_4.14.wav_ASR	oh black over the table i mean the lamp
63-1_257.216_2.101.wav_ASR	and he's not gonna give it back
63-1_281.525_0.69.wav_ASR	okay
63-1_308.542_0.49.wav_ASR	okay
63-1_309.391_6.76.wav_ASR	uh the kid didn't wanna use the amber
63-1_316.275_1.26.wav_ASR	so he went out without
63-1_318.802_1.81.wav_ASR	and he got stuck in wait
63-1_321.731_2.41.wav_ASR	so you want back
63-1_324.164_4.18.wav_ASR	um and his brother was really mad at
63-1_328.364_3.0.wav_ASR	and and so he's took the envelope
63-1_333.482_4.93.wav_ASR	uh then he uh when he got home he gave it to his mother
63-1_360.885_0.43.wav_ASR	oh okay
63-1_361.333_5.35.wav_ASR	the oh do you want to tell you alright now
63-1_371.077_0.39.wav_ASR	okay
63-1_371.488_1.82.wav_ASR	uh oh i'm ready
63-1_373.954_9.02.wav_ASR	ah there's there's a there's a there's a label on the ground
63-1_382.989_5.11.wav_ASR	and uh and it was a use to catch a cat
63-1_388.361_1.55.wav_ASR	but it it was on the
63-1_390.248_1.3.wav_ASR	so i did
63-1_392.33_9.53.wav_ASR	and i need it to take the dog up too the boy so he could kick get
63-1_402.248_11.88.wav_ASR	the he he was he he was couldn't get up because the dog was drawing on
63-1_414.71_2.09.wav_ASR	so i got some
63-1_416.822_3.82.wav_ASR	and he he got up then
63-1_421.431_4.55.wav_ASR	and on the way to the crown he's thought
63-1_425.998_2.87.wav_ASR	and and uh
63-1_965.553_24.44.wav_ASR	uh sender
63-1_990.015_24.73.wav_ASR	and uh she couldn't go to the s she couldn't go to the go to the
63-1_1017.014_15.52.wav_ASR	but uh the but uh sender uh had a friendly godmother who's who got her all and set her up and send her to the b
63-1_1032.558_7.14.wav_ASR	all and at right night she
63-1_1043.301_2.52.wav_ASR	go
63-1_1045.915_8.16.wav_ASR	or and so every one will be w wanting about
63-1_1055.11_1.24.wav_ASR	but you only had
63-1_1056.449_6.94.wav_ASR	and then the control came and said he had the other slide
63-1_1063.516_1.95.wav_ASR	or you tick 'em before
63-1_1065.485_2.85.wav_ASR	and it was her p
63-1_1069.277_5.73.wav_ASR	it's all the inventory uh in the print left up uh happily ever after
63-1_1076.923_0.77.wav_ASR	don't think like that
63-1_1089.922_3.5.wav_ASR	oh i get
63-1_1094.826_14.33.wav_ASR	edge i'd put a p i'd put cha jelly on one slide and paint a butter on the other
63-1_1109.178_2.18.wav_ASR	and then i put it together
63-2_8.939_3.81.wav_ASR	um my speech is okay
63-2_12.805_5.82.wav_ASR	but l a lot of times i c i know what it is but i can't say
63-2_20.929_0.67.wav_ASR	that's why it is
63-2_21.647_1.36.wav_ASR	ah i know what it is
63-2_23.054_4.5.wav_ASR	it and until someone tells me what it is i just can't say
63-2_27.999_0.71.wav_ASR	ah i don't know why
63-2_28.733_2.26.wav_ASR	it it's the way it is now
63-2_38.859_0.35.wav_ASR	yeah
63-2_44.303_3.08.wav_ASR	well i got up in the m uh in the morning
63-2_48.081_2.82.wav_ASR	and right away oh i i i w i wrote over
63-2_51.772_2.14.wav_ASR	is she she was by my side
63-2_54.63_3.83.wav_ASR	and uh i told her i told a little quickly
63-2_59.076_3.32.wav_ASR	the change thing must be
63-2_62.957_13.02.wav_ASR	so then i went to the bath room and i w i i i p i w i went to the bathroom and did my thing
63-2_76.575_5.33.wav_ASR	and then right after i did my thing something happened in here
63-2_83.156_2.36.wav_ASR	and uh i sent
63-2_86.28_0.56.wav_ASR	oh no
63-2_87.247_4.1.wav_ASR	and that's the last thing i remember for week
63-2_110.622_8.52.wav_ASR	well the the last thing i knew before before my stroke hit was uh
63-2_119.546_6.29.wav_ASR	well after my stroke hit uh oh i walk up
63-2_125.884_5.95.wav_ASR	but i was well i remember th this one is an adam
63-2_131.943_3.96.wav_ASR	so the next thing i know i'm back in witchet
63-2_137.638_4.23.wav_ASR	and i'm um on a bad
63-2_141.886_3.02.wav_ASR	it my wife there
63-2_145.895_8.26.wav_ASR	and uh and uh i slowly started talking to
63-2_154.83_6.86.wav_ASR	but i don't think i at at the fir first thing i d oh don't think i made much sense to uh
63-2_161.771_2.36.wav_ASR	but she was always there for me
63-2_166.318_5.94.wav_ASR	so i it you know it was okay 'cause i i could tell or anything i want
63-2_172.567_0.74.wav_ASR	should miss
63-2_174.287_2.43.wav_ASR	did it or whatever she could
63-2_179.54_8.31.wav_ASR	and uh then after a while uh two or three uh numbers would come in anyway
63-2_187.899_9.62.wav_ASR	and th they would do crazy things like lift my legs and lift my back
63-2_197.735_3.12.wav_ASR	and e every day is something different
63-2_200.878_1.4.wav_ASR	that would go down the hell
63-2_203.68_13.15.wav_ASR	and uh they would do um laglis oh uh trying to get me s whatever
63-2_216.852_3.61.wav_ASR	and uh i would do s do stars
63-2_220.72_2.27.wav_ASR	uh i remember that i ju just
63-2_223.735_6.54.wav_ASR	did a lot of uh oh i don't know or
63-2_231.307_0.98.wav_ASR	the uh i don't know
63-2_232.337_1.88.wav_ASR	th there is always somebody there
63-2_234.266_4.36.wav_ASR	but always oh always somebody doing something to me
63-2_238.866_2.82.wav_ASR	lot of it i don't know anyway
63-2_241.734_6.07.wav_ASR	but it w it was very for the first couple weeks uh it was very extensive
63-2_270.707_16.25.wav_ASR	well the th the uh the the best thing i can remember before my stroke was getting married of course
63-2_287.802_2.96.wav_ASR	and uh i was in the service at the time
63-2_290.815_10.36.wav_ASR	but we we before my before i was a price office i was also in the in the air force for twenty two years
63-2_302.963_14.46.wav_ASR	so um other from that i think the the thing that uh i do the most about is in uh in uh in a lunch break
63-2_318.711_10.5.wav_ASR	how i w i was very interested in bashbap blog and a specially s oh um
63-2_330.401_3.01.wav_ASR	had a lot of good memories about fruit bowl
63-2_335.59_16.4.wav_ASR	yeah uh i w i was i was uh oh no b nah i was the best player decisively on the team
63-2_352.759_1.93.wav_ASR	had a lot of input
63-2_356.795_1.32.wav_ASR	all a lot of things happened
63-2_358.702_5.14.wav_ASR	but there's a l a lot of thing
63-2_363.887_3.23.wav_ASR	oh th oh the there's so much uh
63-2_367.253_10.28.wav_ASR	the fact you know oh there's some things uh good and bad that have to be
63-2_377.551_2.11.wav_ASR	uh i i can't do anything
63-2_379.803_3.54.wav_ASR	it's a it's a lot of my don't even remember anyway
63-2_384.569_2.54.wav_ASR	they're either f regular or whatever
63-2_387.736_1.31.wav_ASR	but that that's the way
63-2_411.303_0.58.wav_ASR	okay
63-2_413.03_4.45.wav_ASR	uh there there was a bo boy who hit the ball
63-2_417.912_3.64.wav_ASR	and the ball went into a glass window
63-2_422.674_15.1.wav_ASR	and when it when when it went into the window and it hit the guy on the on the stars and and knocked over the lamp
63-2_438.726_2.45.wav_ASR	and so sh he grabbed the lamp
63-2_442.108_7.4.wav_ASR	and he he told him he wasn't getting it back till the lamp was fixed
63-2_481.005_0.36.wav_ASR	okay
63-2_481.732_8.03.wav_ASR	ah first of all uh the boy did not want to take an alarm
63-2_491.361_5.2.wav_ASR	he he he's he said it it was okay that she didn't have
63-2_497.241_6.7.wav_ASR	so she w he he walked out to in the range and so it was red
63-2_504.464_2.37.wav_ASR	so you had he had to go back on
63-2_508.083_4.21.wav_ASR	and he would all weekend now
63-2_512.317_9.689.wav_ASR	oh and so uh she had to uh she had to get her rubber
63-2_522.629_3.17.wav_ASR	should put it uh in his hand
63-2_525.853_3.21.wav_ASR	th he went to school
63-2_544.992_0.48.wav_ASR	okay
63-2_557.835_3.71.wav_ASR	uh um first of all i see a little curve
63-2_561.562_1.48.wav_ASR	oh and she's trying to get it
63-2_564.448_3.49.wav_ASR	but uh her her
63-2_568.152_0.97.wav_ASR	so if you could
63-2_569.138_10.13.wav_ASR	it so she uh oh she wanted to her father who could get it either 'cause the the later was gone
63-2_579.979_9.18.wav_ASR	and he had a he had a real um he had a dog
63-2_589.176_4.92.wav_ASR	okay and the in a d
63-2_594.116_4.12.wav_ASR	okay in the up up the three channel generator
63-2_599.141_4.71.wav_ASR	and so because she couldn't
63-2_603.984_1.24.wav_ASR	and she could get the cat
63-2_606.497_1.25.wav_ASR	couldn't get the dog
63-2_608.377_9.35.wav_ASR	you went with the fibreman who got our out and got everything back to normal
63-2_1440.511_0.74.wav_ASR	okay
63-2_1441.268_16.0.wav_ASR	uh when the grandmother and their two grandsons were small they brought up the house
63-2_1458.806_6.78.wav_ASR	and uh s banana uh did all the work
63-2_1466.686_10.03.wav_ASR	and as kids got older there were more things for s the they want
63-2_1478.756_14.77.wav_ASR	and finally they they got an invitation from the print that there is gonna be a gallery at the at the prints
63-2_1495.182_6.21.wav_ASR	and uh they they told her she couldn't go 'cause she wa she was an invite
63-2_1501.414_1.13.wav_ASR	it
63-2_1503.72_13.93.wav_ASR	so after they were gone um the c very godmother was showed up and and showed them how she could do
63-2_1518.63_15.49.wav_ASR	and so the first thing the favourite god did was turn all the mice and everything in to
63-2_1535.312_12.67.wav_ASR	and then um the n um the winner was given a fine dress to wear
63-2_1549.523_20.5.wav_ASR	and then when she got to the when she got to the ball uh the only thing the only thing
63-2_1571.01_3.63.wav_ASR	and uh they dance the night away
63-2_1575.707_4.89.wav_ASR	and then a twelve and a half she says she had to
63-2_1580.617_5.67.wav_ASR	oh well she's going one of her splinters was left on the ground
63-2_1586.306_15.28.wav_ASR	so when she got home sender uh oh is back on or on or shamal's clothes and glasses with it dogs and cats and every
63-2_1601.634_26.69.wav_ASR	and uh the sh well it was supposed to be broken by the by the um
63-2_1629.078_3.66.wav_ASR	but they they it is
63-2_1632.753_6.42.wav_ASR	and and so on a shell put on a sh
63-2_1639.194_4.61.wav_ASR	two and it was ex exact
63-2_1644.445_0.98.wav_ASR	because she knew
63-2_1646.792_3.37.wav_ASR	and so a ring got me
63-2_1650.177_1.77.wav_ASR	and you live happily ever after
63-2_1666.397_8.74.wav_ASR	you put uh you put on one w ones you put two s slides that are red together
63-2_1675.69_2.37.wav_ASR	one would pe p. n. better one with ch
63-2_1678.161_2.74.wav_ASR	alright and you get 'em together
63-2_1680.917_3.87.wav_ASR	other you got it s thinner battery the l. c. d. screen
65-1_9.517_0.96.wav_ASR	it seems to be adequate
65-1_28.81_2.53.wav_ASR	the eighty four percent of the last command is five and a half dollars
65-1_35.471_0.49.wav_ASR	why should i
65-1_36.531_2.9.wav_ASR	the happen on a. t. r. market the eighty four
65-1_40.334_5.76.wav_ASR	and i remember we are on some fronts has having the previous battery night
65-1_46.238_15.54.wav_ASR	and i remember nothing nothing after that until until after a c. c. u. and started r starting things slowly about uh th three days after i've moved out of room about
65-1_63.223_3.95.wav_ASR	and the the eighteen ninety uh
65-1_67.496_0.83.wav_ASR	let's see the
65-1_69.041_4.34.wav_ASR	uh was crossing tentree in an apple
65-1_74.421_2.67.wav_ASR	and i remember crossing in the production process
65-1_77.109_7.56.wav_ASR	oh crossing with the light and see in getting up close to the corporate panel on the car going from west to east
65-1_86.021_1.74.wav_ASR	and then i have the sensitivity being spon around
65-1_87.783_6.82.wav_ASR	that's that last that last i remember think for and for simplicity i don't know twenty twenty minutes or so
65-1_104.608_1.57.wav_ASR	one
65-1_107.092_0.66.wav_ASR	it won't
65-1_107.8_10.32.wav_ASR	it was very that was d very triplebling uh because uh really triplebling because um didn't know where i was
65-1_119.162_6.17.wav_ASR	and there were visitors in the uh household room in the in my household room
65-1_125.543_3.84.wav_ASR	and these guys were saying they d the visi
65-1_129.431_3.17.wav_ASR	and i knew who they were new th these people
65-1_132.616_1.52.wav_ASR	but there's a lot lots of 'em there
65-1_134.184_1.5.wav_ASR	it doesn't why w why is
65-1_136.291_2.12.wav_ASR	there are lots of pe there are several people visiting me
65-1_138.802_1.63.wav_ASR	and and there's several masters
65-1_141.127_1.76.wav_ASR	when when is his voice gonna come back
65-1_143.169_1.03.wav_ASR	when is voice gonna come back
65-1_145.808_1.58.wav_ASR	ah i thought that was perfect
65-1_148.727_11.07.wav_ASR	uh and but what i didn't know uh was that the edit ten days with a reading tool pop down my throat uh in a c in a cool
65-1_160.403_2.47.wav_ASR	and then look like it was gonna come out anyway
65-1_162.888_1.7.wav_ASR	and i gave me a triangle
65-1_165.547_13.33.wav_ASR	uh and uh uh and so the the s what turned out to be a square ticket and vocal cords uh changed my voice pretty radically where my wife had t had told me
65-1_178.901_7.83.wav_ASR	she said she said that the uh s said that you you you had it
65-1_190.21_0.31.wav_ASR	so let's
65-1_190.701_1.11.wav_ASR	actually there there was
65-1_191.914_1.46.wav_ASR	it's a one thing you like about me
65-1_193.584_0.55.wav_ASR	and that one goes
65-1_194.184_7.67.wav_ASR	that's that's that's but that was it was extremely troublesome because i d i c i c i didn't know where i was
65-1_202.556_3.45.wav_ASR	when beep is recrecognised it's r recognise it's the same
65-1_206.835_1.36.wav_ASR	when is when is it gonna come back
65-1_208.855_1.99.wav_ASR	and it was ri really really troublesome
65-1_211.097_0.7.wav_ASR	really triple
65-1_214.441_2.34.wav_ASR	that was that was one of the first um
65-1_227.068_4.71.wav_ASR	well it's what what in a anyway is that the the
65-1_232.093_9.72.wav_ASR	and terms of my brain injury if you will uh certain things kind of standing out and we're extremely troublesome
65-1_242.008_14.18.wav_ASR	um um and it is one when when i happen to get flick focus on something i didn't properly update or or or improve up i got it
65-1_256.236_2.98.wav_ASR	that was a pro g s unfortunately angry
65-1_261.478_2.001.wav_ASR	and did never did they never did last out
65-1_264.808_2.63.wav_ASR	um but just the re uh really anyway
65-1_267.486_1.47.wav_ASR	and i cap it on top
65-1_268.978_5.53.wav_ASR	well it was very very very troublesome really troublesome for a lot for for quite a while
65-1_291.425_2.81.wav_ASR	and and and i don't want you ever to relate to that
65-1_294.408_3.91.wav_ASR	ah i wouldn't w i wouldn't would not miss that
65-1_316.655_7.65.wav_ASR	the almost no uh ninety nine is almost a one
65-1_324.396_0.55.wav_ASR	again
65-1_325.376_0.84.wav_ASR	th that
65-1_326.232_3.43.wav_ASR	it's like this just a just a rabbit but not near not nearly a squirrel
65-1_330.55_12.55.wav_ASR	but the the eighty four is uh was was most interesting because because uh oh
65-1_343.181_6.64.wav_ASR	uh i was on what they call the hip hop or a pirate's life meaning i had a wonderful keyboard ahead of me
65-1_349.842_1.58.wav_ASR	it was gonna go for in organisation
65-1_352.182_4.66.wav_ASR	and and uh and my one of my suppliers told me
65-1_356.862_0.89.wav_ASR	he wants to do
65-1_357.802_6.2.wav_ASR	tell me told me i was i was i was going far
65-1_364.136_1.18.wav_ASR	my curve is late in front of it
65-1_366.048_2.15.wav_ASR	uh there was there was nothing stack
65-1_369.12_8.58.wav_ASR	and then uh after the eighty four institution uh personal change which i find out twenty years later is embedded
65-1_377.717_1.63.wav_ASR	but i find out twenty years later than a menu
65-1_380.151_3.17.wav_ASR	uh and the uh and by sound different
65-1_384.141_2.67.wav_ASR	uh i was slow or to compensate thing
65-1_387.869_5.87.wav_ASR	uh but finally did after taking taking more time for competing thing
65-1_393.757_7.06.wav_ASR	and and uh and i couldn't do my engineering job to to to suit me
65-1_401.669_1.51.wav_ASR	and i didn't didn't tell anybody that
65-1_403.668_0.89.wav_ASR	didn't tell anybody about that
65-1_404.612_0.8.wav_ASR	oh i forgot it
65-1_406.295_17.87.wav_ASR	uh sh uh sh oh by myself in a in a coffee room uh and i'm not telling a not telling a school because i just n
65-1_424.226_1.26.wav_ASR	it's before before e. d. a.
65-1_426.413_1.47.wav_ASR	nei nei nei
65-1_428.188_2.09.wav_ASR	actually before the mechanisms of this delivery
65-1_430.428_0.54.wav_ASR	et d. a.
65-1_432.046_2.46.wav_ASR	and and that's on the extra
65-1_434.528_1.11.wav_ASR	how on company business
65-1_436.8_5.82.wav_ASR	and i knew i d i just knew that that uh not be able to compete at a base aspect of my job
65-1_443.288_1.95.wav_ASR	actually i just knew i'm gonna get
65-1_445.562_0.85.wav_ASR	and i knew i would
65-1_447.165_8.14.wav_ASR	had a three kids a white a speech w uh just a l lovely lovely uh lovely a lovely one uh they're home with a three kids
65-1_455.32_2.19.wav_ASR	and i was the i was the
65-1_458.431_2.45.wav_ASR	and i couldn't i couldn't stand on the other side of the floor
65-1_461.855_5.49.wav_ASR	uh and and so i like to say i like to say that i could have to relearn my job
65-1_467.981_7.74.wav_ASR	and it took me s but it did take me probably couple of three years to figure out that that uh i was no longer on on on the fast track
65-1_476.146_1.08.wav_ASR	uh no no no
65-1_477.247_2.36.wav_ASR	it took it wasn't it wasn't obvious
65-1_479.684_3.22.wav_ASR	but i that's no longer in the fashion
65-1_482.928_9.4.wav_ASR	and uh um and the biggest most difficult part of that was the was the short term memories
65-1_493.261_11.8.wav_ASR	uh and so uh i hid it up with a uh frank and pan and will write down everything in there is to help my sh help my short term manager
65-1_506.11_10.319.wav_ASR	uh so it is uh um a largely the the um a phage and and people seeing me definitely at work
65-1_516.482_4.701.wav_ASR	and then of course i'm of course i look uh back look back on it a few years after
65-1_521.2_2.859.wav_ASR	and and i did not discover it to be on the fast track
65-1_524.107_3.97.wav_ASR	but i th oh it it w it was perfectly obvious everybody around me
65-1_528.092_0.72.wav_ASR	the one not necessary
65-1_530.176_14.41.wav_ASR	um and that the uh writing everything down was uh uh the biggest uh is uh s i s i s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a s a
65-1_567.07_6.54.wav_ASR	the the basically there is the the the the
65-1_573.891_4.62.wav_ASR	uh i i i call it pre eighty four percent
65-1_579.419_5.17.wav_ASR	uh that's that's how my li my life has been defined
65-1_585.51_11.37.wav_ASR	uh and i it's i just took um that that that is that is what i call my my defining moment
65-1_597.64_8.89.wav_ASR	because i've struggled with the the uh phavis uh obviously and memory issues uh everything since then
65-1_606.552_13.22.wav_ASR	and and uh um i in uh i mean like for example uh the the um the window of seventy six seventy seven that's out of engineering school a remote control
65-1_619.826_1.84.wav_ASR	uh a job in india
65-1_621.855_7.67.wav_ASR	and so yeah uh the exi is economic viability i l i d i played rant to my phones lived in the limit in my phone
65-1_630.113_6.18.wav_ASR	and that water my dad and i put the uh put a l. c. b. v. in a shallow wave uh a little small car
65-1_637.015_3.44.wav_ASR	yeah and uh it was quite an interesting interesting project
65-1_641.315_4.08.wav_ASR	and and which interesting enough i can probably
65-1_645.41_8.3.wav_ASR	the the the the engine had a rotter four g. c. r. on it which has some difficulties
65-1_653.791_1.8.wav_ASR	and i could probably still today
65-1_655.869_1.58.wav_ASR	uh that's a ninety seven percent
65-1_658.288_2.76.wav_ASR	like a little t. a. remote control but
65-1_662.6_3.89.wav_ASR	yeah but but but i pr but i ca but i'm sorry what i had for supper last night
65-1_667.122_0.49.wav_ASR	can't
65-1_669.274_0.66.wav_ASR	so yeah
65-1_670.235_1.4.wav_ASR	short short message
65-1_671.658_13.02.wav_ASR	but uh but then things from from from long ago and uh do uh do uh do uh d some something longer ago like i can
65-1_695.671_5.07.wav_ASR	oh no actually i was um i was in the p actually for the microphone sensor
65-1_701.591_4.64.wav_ASR	uh and and i got out of school the spring of seventy six
65-1_706.317_1.95.wav_ASR	yeah the job but the company name sherrer
65-1_709.739_0.87.wav_ASR	uh they're in a apple box
65-1_710.687_2.65.wav_ASR	the switch is no longer exists
65-1_714.262_5.09.wav_ASR	but uh i was an engineer in engineering at that
65-1_720.011_10.31.wav_ASR	and so w so i'm my my customers for wha i'll call it for swedish or uh four light fruit and for swedish fruits
65-1_731.149_9.58.wav_ASR	uh um the f one of the small four packs i had to a cable
65-1_745.046_7.51.wav_ASR	um and the uh oh zero a. b. f. eight t. v. c. r. s that's all my current fan customer
65-1_753.154_4.14.wav_ASR	so i was already doing that kind of stuff as my d as a as a job
65-1_758.166_6.91.wav_ASR	but then uh my my father found this uh this article on the agenda
65-1_765.797_12.68.wav_ASR	uh and it just happens to be that it was a project for he now uh the build together that word uh well well uh well i was working in the automatic industries field
65-1_778.497_8.96.wav_ASR	and and uh it um that's okay that's okay how i'm how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how
65-1_815.779_2.14.wav_ASR	but it was it was a real it's a real
65-1_818.492_4.39.wav_ASR	meeting that uh the the hot car at the time was uh the digits and two forty seven
65-1_823.884_3.99.wav_ASR	uh the real it's uh the first uh the t the d. c. r.
65-1_828.597_6.2.wav_ASR	uh and then uh uh you use it for a stop light test those guys off
65-1_835.141_6.83.wav_ASR	and they could the other guys the c the other guys could finish off how the hell is it
65-1_842.229_5.21.wav_ASR	it is it is it's it's a lot of fun seeing in our faces as i in my remote
65-1_910.099_1.2.wav_ASR	oh okay
65-1_911.875_2.36.wav_ASR	that s sorry is there's a a the young lad
65-1_914.589_8.46.wav_ASR	looks like uh uh maybe maybe a teen age like at six grade or seven grade it's kicking a soccer ball
65-1_923.492_6.72.wav_ASR	and then an insert hits it puts a soccer ball through a a a house of window
65-1_930.915_8.97.wav_ASR	and the on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a on a
65-1_940.813_7.32.wav_ASR	and the alt mail it gives up holding the stack of paper and says try to figure out what's going on
65-1_951.714_0.38.wav_ASR	it doesn't
65-1_971.063_5.65.wav_ASR	uh it looks like a a a young a young boy is leaving
65-1_976.736_2.88.wav_ASR	and as as we say is my mother's daughter's mother's son
65-1_979.897_1.4.wav_ASR	it here's there's your problem
65-1_981.983_0.84.wav_ASR	ah
65-1_983.049_1.03.wav_ASR	oh i don't need that
65-1_984.13_4.77.wav_ASR	uh and then then the y. b. legs saying goodbye and everything
65-1_989.831_1.61.wav_ASR	and the remote holding the amber
65-1_991.969_3.23.wav_ASR	and uh the the young lad is out and about walking around
65-1_995.914_1.2.wav_ASR	and it starts to rain
65-1_997.78_1.36.wav_ASR	then in the shared repository
65-1_999.75_0.79.wav_ASR	and he is running
65-1_1000.563_4.18.wav_ASR	and it gets back to his to his mom so soaking wait
65-1_1005.358_0.87.wav_ASR	and he's not happy
65-1_1006.245_1.13.wav_ASR	now it neither should have
65-1_1008.212_2.37.wav_ASR	and then he goes out finally with it with an overview
65-1_1010.631_3.09.wav_ASR	and and and uh it looks like all is
65-1_1027.309_5.9.wav_ASR	well the beginning it looks like a cat a pet cat i cleaned up a tree
65-1_1034.269_3.46.wav_ASR	uh and being probably changed by a dog come up a three
65-1_1038.222_1.16.wav_ASR	that's stuck up on the tree
65-1_1040.013_8.761.wav_ASR	uh a little curve that was probably your own uh broer for them or a triangle uh and then one is our cat down
65-1_1049.333_10.48.wav_ASR	and looks like uh an old male figure who's and is and is and is and is and it's and is and is calling up the three and is and is call up there by this backing dog
65-1_1060.56_5.52.wav_ASR	also and now then there's also a a a bird uh over the other side of this tree again
65-1_1066.533_11.02.wav_ASR	and there's also the local favourite and the and the and the and the and the and the and the and the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the
65-1_1077.577_2.22.wav_ASR	that's that's that's that's a three
65-1_1353.355_0.3.wav_ASR	but i th
65-1_1353.835_5.45.wav_ASR	send real uh oh it's uh r her mother passed away
65-1_1360.127_2.77.wav_ASR	uh f for the uh remote
65-1_1363.72_8.84.wav_ASR	and uh that's the the quick start there is the the quick start batteries
65-1_1373.655_13.75.wav_ASR	uh and they uh and in their in their own lives um the uh uh serials
65-1_1387.769_7.59.wav_ASR	uh yeah and uh um and the just uh it just worked work very worked a lot
65-1_1395.968_9.9.wav_ASR	um and then uh in the kingdom the king had a yeah a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
65-1_1406.524_19.39.wav_ASR	and one of the advantages um is it's uh yeah
65-1_1427.134_24.41.wav_ASR	um and the and uh with the help of uh yeah with the help of this and uh oh they're not in a and uh in the and uh
65-1_1451.694_17.08.wav_ASR	and uh uh and the s the step down getting one of one of her t her daughters married off uh and so would not allow
65-1_1469.504_3.98.wav_ASR	uh uh her uh step sisters went
65-1_1474.182_11.98.wav_ASR	and uh uh and a and a he carried it up but uh turned into uh a pump and then mine went up but uh turned into horns
65-1_1486.874_8.89.wav_ASR	and i think that that the the the the of the the of the the of the c the of the of the the of the of the
65-1_1496.594_3.35.wav_ASR	and uh the sh sh
65-1_1499.966_5.76.wav_ASR	also um the the the print uh date anyway with a scenario
65-1_1506.4_12.64.wav_ASR	and but the stickiness oh well from the uh the liricola pher form factor was he had to back my light night because everything would be gonna go back to the way it was in the middle because everything would be gonna go back to the way it was in the middle
65-1_1519.217_1.04.wav_ASR	so it is
65-1_1520.273_3.71.wav_ASR	late so she heard about a and left a glass of lemon behind
65-1_1524.602_11.17.wav_ASR	uh uh and then uh and then after the the the p the the the the p that's only one person interested in
65-1_1535.789_2.93.wav_ASR	it was the the gel that left the left the black slippery behind
65-1_1538.769_9.72.wav_ASR	uh and so the the the device we're sent through the kingdom to try and figure out who is that uh layout below
65-1_1549.451_11.43.wav_ASR	uh and and it was the w it was the one it was the the it was the the p it was the the it was the the this small quaster
65-1_1561.723_3.47.wav_ASR	and uh the step sister neither one i don't fit the launchable
65-1_1565.701_3.72.wav_ASR	standard is but would fit in the lower
65-1_1569.443_7.35.wav_ASR	and so she is identified as the one that the that the press uh oh wanted to wanna wanted to
65-1_1576.915_5.67.wav_ASR	and so the uh so then the uh the scenario
65-1_1582.609_2.0.wav_ASR	yeah all lit up the and they lit up really everywhere
65-1_1595.381_4.76.wav_ASR	oh prefer preferably uh uh on on we red
65-1_1600.8_8.05.wav_ASR	you would use a night and and uh get uh it's spread the spreadsheet on uh one side of the red
65-1_1609.79_6.11.wav_ASR	oh but then the on the other other side of the bu other other red the optional yellow is great
65-1_1617.339_1.5.wav_ASR	and then you take a smile
65-1_1619.081_5.76.wav_ASR	now not nine because you you cut up you c cut up the the the the yellow and the and the the jar
65-1_1624.893_6.9.wav_ASR	but uh but you take your screw and and screw out the the the uh a grey yellow on the other piece of rubber
65-1_1632.163_2.41.wav_ASR	use that use the night script to read it out
65-1_1634.597_2.32.wav_ASR	then then put the two glasses together
65-1_1636.935_3.5.wav_ASR	and you got the ultimate the ultimate battery and yellow cell
65-2_8.167_1.85.wav_ASR	speeds
65-2_10.563_0.77.wav_ASR	much improved
65-2_12.338_9.08.wav_ASR	the the holding of w holding of speech searching for words uh less than it did
65-2_22.185_23.08.wav_ASR	um the one what happens is that the uh um if i have an okay or something like that i will may do it then uh and then think later on and and then think later
65-2_45.514_1.3.wav_ASR	it sh i should have said that
65-2_46.935_0.67.wav_ASR	could have said that
65-2_48.111_1.09.wav_ASR	why why didn't i say
65-2_49.95_6.53.wav_ASR	uh for example in the triple shooting a automatic electronics um there's some bit difficult with a car
65-2_57.16_5.08.wav_ASR	uh it helps instantly if i think about it for uh about a day or so
65-2_62.323_26.47.wav_ASR	and li uh and else i've seen it before uh the the the overall of the the the p um the uh the uh the uh the uh the most of all the other aspects
65-2_89.557_8.62.wav_ASR	and uh it is uh oh well i'll i'll i'll i'll i'll get ahead of idea
65-2_98.79_1.57.wav_ASR	why d why didn't i think of that before
65-2_100.765_5.64.wav_ASR	oh i i d before my before my eighty four i would have thought of that anyway
65-2_107.061_5.26.wav_ASR	but uh it's much more difficult than and uh takes a longer than it does
65-2_112.37_1.84.wav_ASR	that's that's that's
65-2_114.233_1.4.wav_ASR	then that way for thirty six years
65-2_127.18_6.21.wav_ASR	um the first one was a where i was beep at an interaction
65-2_134.294_2.7.wav_ASR	uh and uh yeah and it up
65-2_137.011_6.39.wav_ASR	uh i got the uh yeah a whole entire hardware supplier's clock in the drawer side
65-2_144.01_12.54.wav_ASR	and uh it had a stereo phillips broken in four broken rip
65-2_157.19_1.61.wav_ASR	did i did i say spongy long
65-2_159.526_1.7.wav_ASR	uh seventy nine is a lot
65-2_161.937_1.51.wav_ASR	uh th three and a half which in the colour
65-2_164.72_6.62.wav_ASR	and uh in uh i uh in a coffee for thirty and a half weeks
65-2_172.132_7.28.wav_ASR	um honest probably probably about two and a half months
65-2_180.19_6.53.wav_ASR	and our third child was born uh three days after i was uh removed out of my c. c. u.
65-2_190.003_8.12.wav_ASR	and the second one uh was uh Fabulous ninety ninety per cent uh ten straight into a colour wall according
65-2_199.113_2.48.wav_ASR	it was a shared r. t. v. on the left side
65-2_202.563_6.32.wav_ASR	uh and uh and my i believe that i was unconscious for
65-2_209.678_1.66.wav_ASR	well i th i guess i don't know how long
65-2_212.237_10.04.wav_ASR	but uh um i recall walking across the street starting at the corner panel of the car in front of me
65-2_223.056_2.51.wav_ASR	and then i have the set the settings being spunted around
65-2_226.386_7.17.wav_ASR	and then and then uh uh later like a say i i d first i remember thing maybe
65-2_234.386_0.46.wav_ASR	it don't know
65-2_234.865_0.96.wav_ASR	twenty minutes later
65-2_236.459_2.59.wav_ASR	and and uh i th i was in a great mistake
65-2_239.878_5.52.wav_ASR	oh it was in a wonderful mode because the f eighty four the last time i remember is five days before the accident
65-2_246.349_7.14.wav_ASR	and uh um and this one uh f mar uh february nineteen ninety nine i know exactly where i was what i was doing in what i was doing
65-2_254.174_2.51.wav_ASR	and i w i was i was i was in a really great
65-2_257.551_13.19.wav_ASR	and then i say up a p a brain injury because um uh oh i think it was about t one day or two days later
65-2_271.809_19.88.wav_ASR	uh and uh i d that was that w that was the both except for uh in the in the leg for uh in the in the leg for you
65-2_292.55_3.94.wav_ASR	um it did finally go away when the brainstorming went down
65-2_296.863_0.66.wav_ASR	finally we
65-2_297.627_3.16.wav_ASR	but i don't i don't maybe th three four or five
65-2_303.117_1.68.wav_ASR	the last the subsequent amount of time
65-2_305.602_7.65.wav_ASR	uh and and the doctors could not tell me whether that the television would ever would ever go away
65-2_313.306_5.33.wav_ASR	it was already in the
65-2_318.652_8.33.wav_ASR	and uh um i recall that the orthopedic guy that stuck a pin in my in my my t. v. uh said
65-2_327.006_12.71.wav_ASR	the oh uh after after three or four months when when the when the all the the fios and the uh yeah and the tibbit is started to heal he said
65-2_340.67_4.18.wav_ASR	oh you know that's probably the most paint injury no painful injury known to man
65-2_345.576_0.85.wav_ASR	oh okay
65-2_346.527_1.96.wav_ASR	yeah well that's me being a bit lazy then right
65-2_349.558_1.88.wav_ASR	but you you you you you you you
65-2_353.552_2.83.wav_ASR	that's kind of uh it
65-2_356.478_4.01.wav_ASR	that those are the two actions and in it and uh at a t at a t at a top level
65-2_372.985_7.65.wav_ASR	oh west tent going into the rest uh ten and ten and grandio
65-2_399.4_12.1.wav_ASR	oh the uh um after the first e eighty four minutes uh when i did not know
65-2_411.553_17.22.wav_ASR	oh what what happened was that the eighty four um laptop's were first about by by uh by my my my the company
65-2_429.508_17.32.wav_ASR	and uh um and uh uh oh my boss at that time um
65-2_447.04_0.75.wav_ASR	oh call it that then
65-2_449.397_1.27.wav_ASR	or let's say we're power wi
65-2_450.939_2.51.wav_ASR	but uh learn how to use their their own
65-2_454.232_6.24.wav_ASR	uh of course this is before the this before the web eighty four uh and and those kind of things
65-2_460.758_11.03.wav_ASR	uh i'd be doing a uh naster and which is nassarational analysis um for the company um for quite a long time
65-2_472.499_9.05.wav_ASR	and uh but that was all that was all on uh a punch cards that kind of stuff uh or or a menu or a or a desktop computer
65-2_482.344_4.62.wav_ASR	um and uh um and so here is a t a simple laptop
65-2_486.979_1.14.wav_ASR	oh no no no that you use
65-2_488.329_4.44.wav_ASR	and so they brought this uh that my boss brought is laptop here
65-2_492.784_4.6.wav_ASR	uh and those years there is a a user manual that came along with it
65-2_498.448_4.81.wav_ASR	uh and so try to use a c a computer a op uh computer use manual
65-2_503.994_7.47.wav_ASR	uh if you have red uh oh if you have red a microphone of any kind they are absolutely difficult
65-2_512.342_14.661.wav_ASR	and uh one of the one th one thing in particular which uh uh what was was problematic when the in the in the in the and the manual oh was uh it said to select something
65-2_528.184_0.51.wav_ASR	select
65-2_528.839_12.43.wav_ASR	well have we never had any training in in a uh in a a laptop uh or microphone oh
65-2_542.262_6.07.wav_ASR	and and after several days of trying to figure out what select meet
65-2_548.888_1.04.wav_ASR	yeah that will happen
65-2_550.399_0.6.wav_ASR	it's like me
65-2_551.438_0.49.wav_ASR	oh
65-2_552.509_5.58.wav_ASR	that's black men uh p what what they meant by select i couldn't figure it
65-2_558.551_0.56.wav_ASR	it could
65-2_559.312_1.04.wav_ASR	there is no way
65-2_560.944_2.31.wav_ASR	uh unfortunately triple double triple triple triple triple triple triple triple triple triple triple triple triple triple triple triple triple triple triple triple triple
65-2_564.422_5.97.wav_ASR	and so 'cause finally i called a cookie and uh uh
65-2_570.608_3.88.wav_ASR	but what what did the what is this menu i mean what they say silence
65-2_575.568_7.44.wav_ASR	and it described the the the tap and the cursor and moving the cursor along the cursor down and high light in a array
65-2_583.899_1.23.wav_ASR	that's what i meant by self
65-2_585.777_2.95.wav_ASR	well hell that was never described in the manual at all
65-2_589.857_3.86.wav_ASR	and that that that really that for me for a laptop
65-2_594.838_7.3.wav_ASR	and so i i ca because uh very questioning as to whether whether i would could go back to work even function at work
65-2_603.43_5.21.wav_ASR	um and and so finally the the that's say the the chip on the keyboard
65-2_609.025_0.57.wav_ASR	oh okay
65-2_609.645_8.98.wav_ASR	but that's most basic of terms which the the um uh dash manual
65-2_619.047_2.1.wav_ASR	oh but i know now this is dash not a mouse
65-2_621.166_1.3.wav_ASR	it's before microsoft exists
65-2_623.365_14.01.wav_ASR	as the boss manager it did not it did not uh oh that somebody would would have the it have the the colour and uh television and computer enough to question an meeting of silence
65-2_638.605_1.01.wav_ASR	they did not
65-2_640.35_2.3.wav_ASR	it doesn't matter did not destroy that anyway
65-2_643.738_14.19.wav_ASR	and so so the and uh so i'm going back to work and uh um struggling with the evaluation uh and uh short term memories and the like and and trying to uh to function
65-2_658.457_15.64.wav_ASR	and and finally um i after a couple of years um the company brought out uh uh what to call a friendlier and and uh said
65-2_675.07_5.2.wav_ASR	you might might have it t take the f take the triangular and then write stuff down
65-2_681.229_2.47.wav_ASR	and so well that was that was a god sentence
65-2_684.72_2.15.wav_ASR	and just being able to write right thing down
65-2_686.892_1.67.wav_ASR	so i i carry my small
65-2_689.233_0.96.wav_ASR	yeah but they're right now
65-2_690.968_8.11.wav_ASR	still i carry small a small n uh no no no no no i go yeah today
65-2_699.671_10.58.wav_ASR	guess that that that was that was writing what i figured out uh when my my boss told me oh
65-2_710.85_7.47.wav_ASR	oh the map that was uh that that was uh um uh no no n uh new lease on life if you
65-2_719.266_2.66.wav_ASR	um uh that that in the
65-2_721.95_17.32.wav_ASR	and and also i ended up uh as a later as a um the front manager for the company
65-2_739.905_10.88.wav_ASR	uh i developed a p oh tricks where i when i meet somebody new i will always say their name over and over again in myself
65-2_751.358_5.4.wav_ASR	use their name in any kind of vulnerable rubber cover
65-2_757.276_2.99.wav_ASR	you still have your name every time for your last name or or both
65-2_760.315_4.68.wav_ASR	and then uh after the after the c after the confrontation to write their name down
65-2_766.354_8.45.wav_ASR	uh and and that that's been a that that's that's a that that's a p a colour trigger that i that i i still use today
65-2_775.921_2.94.wav_ASR	for example i'd mat uh in our neighbour mat uh
65-2_779.492_1.18.wav_ASR	ah but i'm ma i'm at home now
65-2_781.203_0.98.wav_ASR	now down the form
65-2_782.926_11.55.wav_ASR	uh get a feel on and then the in the uh neighbourhood out of a wall of several days ago and and uh move to the neighbourhood some time back
65-2_794.526_1.25.wav_ASR	oh i got this name
65-2_795.797_6.87.wav_ASR	and i thought it and said his name over and over again and told my wife about it and then uh then write it down
65-2_803.378_7.6.wav_ASR	and uh this morning i was i saw him up for a walk and and couldn't recall his name for instance but then i thought for a while
65-2_810.996_1.51.wav_ASR	then finally final the name came to
65-2_813.742_14.39.wav_ASR	so but but the the difficulty on on um requiring name is quite has been quite a quite an in available tool and uh i'll tell me current technology
65-2_839.375_0.52.wav_ASR	yes
65-2_840.697_4.78.wav_ASR	the uh um i think i understand to yeah last week
65-2_846.085_1.32.wav_ASR	maybe maybe that's it
65-2_847.746_4.92.wav_ASR	time i spent the time is a at the remote control as a volume control as well
65-2_853.54_6.13.wav_ASR	uh and uh um because i i start it off four which is twenty year after the eighty four in eighty four
65-2_860.446_8.79.wav_ASR	and it became rather troublesome to me because having they just didn't do the rabbit for the brain iner in those years
65-2_869.993_1.69.wav_ASR	so there is no problem
65-2_871.699_1.97.wav_ASR	you just yeah a rabbit
65-2_873.684_3.67.wav_ASR	that's the
65-2_878.184_5.53.wav_ASR	um and uh because they just did not do the in those years
65-2_883.737_16.3.wav_ASR	and oh the fourth next twenty years oh white and i forgot about uh um
65-2_901.056_3.61.wav_ASR	and the two sides of the project is four to five times larger
65-2_905.719_4.72.wav_ASR	that's what they're telling people even fifteen years ago
65-2_911.291_15.93.wav_ASR	um and so i want it uh to i want to share that with with uh yeah give them hope that's r is possible
65-2_928.404_1.38.wav_ASR	it just takes a long time
65-2_930.61_10.94.wav_ASR	and in all four when i started their r. and r. oh it was i heard noises and their flavours
65-2_942.297_1.58.wav_ASR	oh a year in a year and a half yeah
65-2_944.156_1.01.wav_ASR	here it is in effect
65-2_945.302_0.94.wav_ASR	here you are
65-2_947.407_3.51.wav_ASR	hey you don't stop recording
65-2_950.937_7.04.wav_ASR	the rate may be asymmetric if you will and slow down periodically after a a euro in a half
65-2_958.775_1.9.wav_ASR	you never never stop recovery
65-2_961.454_7.72.wav_ASR	oh i had a in the eighteen uh eighty four i had a a dead spot with no feeling above the left hip
65-2_970.136_2.65.wav_ASR	and there is something that i excepted
65-2_972.842_1.73.wav_ASR	and there is a box with it
65-2_974.655_0.98.wav_ASR	you know no big deal
65-2_975.956_3.16.wav_ASR	but to stick a pin there then wouldn't wouldn't fit
65-2_979.96_1.4.wav_ASR	ah no no idea
65-2_981.865_4.86.wav_ASR	and then it was probably be able five years ago or something
65-2_987.413_0.4.wav_ASR	think so yeah
65-2_987.879_0.74.wav_ASR	that's oh no
65-2_989.309_5.7.wav_ASR	twenty five euros after the eighty four i was in the in the bedroom put 'em on my sofa socks one million
65-2_996.424_4.47.wav_ASR	and i had feeling in the spot that had no feeling for twenty five years
65-2_1002.063_12.36.wav_ASR	so wha what i'm what i'm telling actually is that the cover is solid
65-2_1014.632_2.9.wav_ASR	just that's still yeah never ever in contact with it
65-2_1017.689_1.16.wav_ASR	you just don't support
65-2_1019.52_6.059.wav_ASR	oh i don't think
65-2_1068.805_3.42.wav_ASR	yes it's uh no no no
65-2_1072.242_7.48.wav_ASR	is it ti ti time time is the time is the best uh y you time is the best uh y you use a. l. and in those kind of cases
65-2_1080.467_7.98.wav_ASR	because you you the feeling that the feel that you don't have it will listen
65-2_1088.535_2.52.wav_ASR	and and you'll notice one day
65-2_1091.749_2.26.wav_ASR	okay i d i i feel like that i didn't have it before
65-2_1094.551_1.56.wav_ASR	yeah actually it will happen
65-2_1096.384_0.98.wav_ASR	you will experience that
65-2_1108.416_2.63.wav_ASR	um oh actually i don't know
65-2_1111.095_6.75.wav_ASR	it was it was uh it is i mean i was used to uh a little bit of a little pinky et cetera
65-2_1118.126_4.87.wav_ASR	uh but i d i don't i don't know if i got used to it or or ignored it or or no
65-2_1124.138_3.5.wav_ASR	but uh like say twenty five euros later just put on the socks one morning
65-2_1128.17_0.83.wav_ASR	hey wait a minute
65-2_1129.343_1.05.wav_ASR	uh i got feeling there
65-2_1131.24_2.06.wav_ASR	and had had had not before
65-2_1134.534_0.63.wav_ASR	oh wait a minute
65-2_1135.397_0.91.wav_ASR	uh that no idea
65-2_1149.083_1.64.wav_ASR	they will it will
65-2_1150.924_0.87.wav_ASR	then the numbers will work
65-2_1151.84_1.31.wav_ASR	and they they will
65-2_1153.17_0.46.wav_ASR	it they will
65-2_1173.169_4.87.wav_ASR	oh the when the when i when i i first first time i met my wife
65-2_1179.585_5.52.wav_ASR	but when she c when i see an eye first metas
65-2_1185.345_2.45.wav_ASR	oh we waited d we waited a little while together
65-2_1188.603_5.09.wav_ASR	uh i'm from a and uh the uh in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the
65-2_1193.708_1.47.wav_ASR	uh myself for a plain feel
65-2_1195.197_4.75.wav_ASR	uh and it was before class is started at redo
65-2_1200.599_1.59.wav_ASR	okay the nineteen seventy two
65-2_1203.067_4.66.wav_ASR	uh it was uh uh r her first day in camp
65-2_1208.447_1.29.wav_ASR	my first day in america
65-2_1210.419_10.65.wav_ASR	um there was to be a a dance at uh that the dawn i'm staying at
65-2_1221.089_2.26.wav_ASR	again again each of these are our first for example
65-2_1224.373_5.17.wav_ASR	and uh oh and uh and so i was a little bit earlier
65-2_1229.596_7.78.wav_ASR	which i th i will arrive but places a little bit earlier given a control of of the oh of the situation
65-2_1238.004_3.79.wav_ASR	and uh uh so i had to be just a little bit longer for the t for the dashboard there
65-2_1242.551_5.71.wav_ASR	and uh and uh my wife and uh and her her wine man
65-2_1248.927_1.99.wav_ASR	yeah curves curve is go with battery
65-2_1251.625_0.36.wav_ASR	it's true
65-2_1252.36_7.75.wav_ASR	or or white and uh a r a r painting in a one man uh uh that showed up there it at this this
65-2_1260.78_3.88.wav_ASR	and the uh and that same is voice is never a stranger
65-2_1265.396_2.78.wav_ASR	the is the a a three uh extra
65-2_1268.95_2.08.wav_ASR	maybe you look up and web browser extra
65-2_1272.802_5.88.wav_ASR	uh but anyway so that uh she and a girl friend uh walked up to me and
65-2_1278.901_2.74.wav_ASR	uh he is the uh he's the the dashboard here
65-2_1281.66_2.44.wav_ASR	yeah well i think so
65-2_1284.355_0.44.wav_ASR	of course to be
65-2_1284.946_0.71.wav_ASR	that's why
65-2_1285.671_4.64.wav_ASR	and uh and we i'm just uh i'm holding around
65-2_1290.557_3.4.wav_ASR	oh no i oh i ran her that uh that that that date
65-2_1294.796_2.28.wav_ASR	and uh that's where we started
65-2_1297.1_3.94.wav_ASR	and and uh oh it's a three we're we're about to have a three years so
65-2_1301.09_1.27.wav_ASR	it's a rabbit about three euros so
65-2_1303.312_4.59.wav_ASR	and after about uh four years i figured out that well maybe something's going on in here
65-2_1307.917_1.44.wav_ASR	and oh to get more serious about this
65-2_1310.334_6.28.wav_ASR	so it's just like i c i i i encourage her of of uh picking me up at a at a at a c at a school dance
65-2_1317.648_2.02.wav_ASR	that's what we're we're not sure yet but she picked up on it
65-2_1359.514_5.59.wav_ASR	hey a young a young boy it's it's a p oh great school has had a slogan
65-2_1365.124_0.54.wav_ASR	it's okay yeah
65-2_1366.388_2.61.wav_ASR	it yeah that ends up on the other side
65-2_1369.723_9.4.wav_ASR	uh a gentleman on a couch uh there in the window yeah it's saying right by where the soccer ball comes through and knocks down and supplies him
65-2_1379.989_6.19.wav_ASR	and then the he he gets to balls stands by the broken window trying to find out just to what happened
65-2_1402.182_12.63.wav_ASR	and the beginning this this mother it appears uh has to have it to her son because it goes after school or goes somewhere
65-2_1415.551_2.24.wav_ASR	uh and uh he is
65-2_1418.288_0.93.wav_ASR	it says no and
65-2_1419.62_0.77.wav_ASR	oh no
65-2_1421.306_1.08.wav_ASR	and then
65-2_1422.451_2.41.wav_ASR	and then in the middle his starting on it
65-2_1425.438_1.43.wav_ASR	and then replace heavier on it
65-2_1426.933_7.19.wav_ASR	and and uh and then uh he goes back on just a sucking at the bone as with another kind of drawing at
65-2_1434.453_6.25.wav_ASR	and the last the end of the story was he learning in his lesson and uh has the alphabet with him is walking in the room
65-2_1455.01_13.73.wav_ASR	the way this started was that uh uh it looks like uh that there is a d a a three with a dog at the p the base of the three a a a male and a female
65-2_1469.12_2.18.wav_ASR	the dog is barking at a dog is barking at this guy
65-2_1471.974_7.79.wav_ASR	and uh on the on the on the triple line there's a cat with a globe and a triangle down below this cat
65-2_1480.206_6.04.wav_ASR	and it would appear that uh uh a cat w climbed up the tree
65-2_1487.152_3.15.wav_ASR	the uh the little girl's cat come up on the tree and got stuck up there
65-2_1491.016_10.21.wav_ASR	they they they uh by a mail a man uh oh was either being chased up the tree by the dog who's up or climbed the three
65-2_1501.878_3.4.wav_ASR	it's also a a fire trap and a fire engine
65-2_1506.838_1.32.wav_ASR	uh par of a fire in a later
65-2_1508.684_7.57.wav_ASR	and it looks like the la that the the ladder is being used by the fibreman to the receiver either the the man or the cat or both
65-2_1517.004_11.24.wav_ASR	uh and uh and a and a and a remote button is over an uh a a a remote trigger
65-2_1528.296_3.07.wav_ASR	oh
65-2_1754.983_9.4.wav_ASR	the n. r. l. a. is a the the of a a of a a of a p a of a kingdom who is
65-2_1764.522_2.45.wav_ASR	see her mother had passed uh and i'm not able to pass away
65-2_1767.818_1.36.wav_ASR	and my father remarried
65-2_1769.925_8.29.wav_ASR	and the stepmother had uh uh two two dollars uh we're we're a mean means
65-2_1778.914_21.3.wav_ASR	uh and as they uh after they were married uh the the p oh r and stepmother arrived uh suddenly nothing
65-2_1801.139_8.38.wav_ASR	and uh so so it's sender is sent our time working uh polling that kind of stuff around the house
65-2_1810.138_10.22.wav_ASR	and and uh in that in the in the kingdom there was uh a a price who is not married
65-2_1821.196_18.68.wav_ASR	um an advisor to the king suggested a he a ball being held yeah with the p the extra perpects in the his his son to the elderly young ladies in the kingdom
65-2_1840.902_3.19.wav_ASR	ah so the word is put out about the ball coming up
65-2_1844.858_6.3.wav_ASR	uh sender colour is really happy about the bu about the ball coming coming up as where are the the stepsisters
65-2_1851.712_16.43.wav_ASR	uh and so they the f um uh form angles for the channel uh for the ball
65-2_1868.918_10.26.wav_ASR	and uh um and then at the last minute uh the step mother told sunday she was not going to the to the ball
65-2_1879.2_8.54.wav_ASR	and and they uh and the also uh that a step downers were we're really really m
65-2_1888.574_2.81.wav_ASR	uh and so so the staplers went to the ball
65-2_1892.097_14.38.wav_ASR	and but in the meantime well the before b uh before the ball or at the before the ball um a s uh sender is very godmother showed up and and said that well
65-2_1906.5_5.6.wav_ASR	and so it it um made for her a just a a lovely down
65-2_1912.863_16.73.wav_ASR	and they and they turn up a a um by uh um by uh um by uh um by uh in into a a s i believe that we that ended up in terms
65-2_1930.594_4.29.wav_ASR	um and uh yeah so that's a she didn't get into the ball
65-2_1935.637_15.69.wav_ASR	uh and uh um the press uh it was quite good with the step uh step drawers and and every everyone's around there and then and everybody's hid it off
65-2_1951.795_2.29.wav_ASR	instead of spending the night answering the
65-2_1954.409_7.13.wav_ASR	that our godmother told sunday that that uh he has to be home home by midnight because this this all will end tonight
65-2_1962.363_5.08.wav_ASR	and so the the the print and sender are demanding at minute
65-2_1967.926_1.87.wav_ASR	and and and
65-2_1970.219_0.31.wav_ASR	oh no
65-2_1970.547_6.69.wav_ASR	and that runs runs out of the runs out of the place leaving a class slider one class slider behind
65-2_1978.161_9.82.wav_ASR	and and as she's being driven uh the the uh um coach turned back into aponkin
65-2_1988.0_2.49.wav_ASR	and uh the uh horse turned back into the mind
65-2_1990.617_5.26.wav_ASR	and the the fruit and back into the horse uh and uh our our our dog
65-2_1996.13_0.56.wav_ASR	oh no wait
65-2_1997.231_3.15.wav_ASR	and then so but still that that it was over
65-2_2000.401_10.91.wav_ASR	and uh oh and then after the ball the the parts decided that there is only the only this centre colour that he was interested in
65-2_2012.653_3.04.wav_ASR	nobody could nobody do a remote control is it could not find her
65-2_2016.419_10.69.wav_ASR	uh and so he he put his device out to the task of of trying to locate sensor that that uh she left behind
65-2_2027.888_3.08.wav_ASR	and uh um came to the centre nils's house
65-2_2031.017_3.76.wav_ASR	is the the staplers did not fit the he staplers
65-2_2035.46_4.69.wav_ASR	uh and but but turn that it it it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's
65-2_2041.079_9.609.wav_ASR	uh and so that it ended up uh uh being that that sender and the print's got together we're already lit up happily ever
65-2_2063.239_2.41.wav_ASR	we have uh two slides of a red
65-2_2066.402_6.391.wav_ASR	yeah the idea is a banana butter and uh a night or a or a spoon
65-2_2073.536_1.341.wav_ASR	it's like two pieces of a bridge
65-2_2075.728_3.94.wav_ASR	spread the p. n. battery from the jar on one of the pieces of a a red
65-2_2080.572_5.141.wav_ASR	and then you you speed the speed the yellow on the other piece of red
65-2_2086.377_2.24.wav_ASR	uh then you put the pieces of red together
65-2_2088.635_2.25.wav_ASR	and there you have a pen and button
richardson16a_10.7_4.51.wav_ASR	ah scroll wheels
richardson16a_17.87_12.8.wav_ASR	oh i i uh i don't talk a lot about that
richardson16a_31.22_5.93.wav_ASR	ah i so i don't get that lot of pictures
richardson16a_49.929_0.47.wav_ASR	yes
richardson16a_52.74_11.92.wav_ASR	uh i w i was off uh from work uh that's what the t. v.
richardson16a_65.34_2.55.wav_ASR	uh this thing i don't know
richardson16a_68.947_2.09.wav_ASR	it did no voice your oh
richardson16a_71.271_1.62.wav_ASR	just happy like that
richardson16a_73.45_11.01.wav_ASR	uh and we wa uh s the sh oh for five d. s ding all that thing to no buy the
richardson16a_85.34_7.84.wav_ASR	oh one uh that the gaps i brought to on me
richardson16a_93.372_9.44.wav_ASR	like a l. e. d. uh he said the m. bel
richardson16a_103.78_7.31.wav_ASR	uh a was uh they not into the door
richardson16a_111.14_3.2.wav_ASR	and i came to wed in that
richardson16a_115.09_0.66.wav_ASR	but so
richardson16a_116.187_1.13.wav_ASR	what happened
richardson16a_118.44_2.68.wav_ASR	that's the lamp the door
richardson16a_122.01_12.89.wav_ASR	uh and other lights uh this same guy came back on me and uh to me into the p. a. a.
richardson16a_135.763_3.57.wav_ASR	and it is they did an m. r. r. uh

richardson16a_308.66_2.43.wav_ASR	yeah i had to walk out
richardson16a_312.42_9.11.wav_ASR	ah when uh oh is walking i turned to the think about uh
richardson16a_321.726_0.48.wav_ASR	um
richardson16a_322.948_3.62.wav_ASR	oh well that's part of but

scale01a_85.726_0.41.wav_ASR	now
scale01a_86.974_8.13.wav_ASR	now it's uh th uh me uh uh writing uh my glasses
scale01a_95.226_2.01.wav_ASR	two dollars
scale01a_97.786_1.88.wav_ASR	and uh pop
scale01a_100.287_7.55.wav_ASR	and uh three days ago one two three days ago
scale01a_108.212_0.82.wav_ASR	oh
scale01a_109.052_7.46.wav_ASR	uh this one here this is pretty good and l num num
scale01a_117.392_2.29.wav_ASR	and then here here
scale01a_120.318_1.52.wav_ASR	and then no more
scale01a_121.86_2.12.wav_ASR	and it to scroll
scale01a_130.574_0.8.wav_ASR	ah i don't know
scale01a_131.613_1.14.wav_ASR	ah i don't know
scale01a_133.018_1.89.wav_ASR	maybe i don't know
scale01a_134.995_3.76.wav_ASR	it just words words uh uh nothing
scale01a_138.831_3.27.wav_ASR	oh i can't talk
scale01a_143.171_2.03.wav_ASR	uh and uh
scale01a_153.356_11.49.wav_ASR	oh um maybe uh um this the man the man
scale01a_165.738_1.07.wav_ASR	ah don't know that

scale01a_216.814_4.08.wav_ASR	and then speech and then slowly slowly
scale01a_221.164_3.2.wav_ASR	sometimes in some times now but slowly slow
scale01a_225.219_2.62.wav_ASR	and uh i i don't know that
scale01a_227.885_7.18.wav_ASR	so maybe uh maybe a many many years ago i can't talk
scale01a_235.081_4.79.wav_ASR	well uh i i don't know that but sometimes easy sometimes difficult
scale01a_240.106_2.22.wav_ASR	but it's important to do you you know
scale01a_242.755_3.3.wav_ASR	little bit of better some words and sentences
scale01a_246.706_1.43.wav_ASR	sometimes pretty good

tap07a_833.488_10.52.wav_ASR	the curve had um sorry the the three had a cat in it
tap07a_845.693_10.9.wav_ASR	and the curve was
tap07a_864.583_14.75.wav_ASR	anyway anyway so the f the
tap07a_883.913_2.75.wav_ASR	the dog barking
tap07a_890.04_8.03.wav_ASR	and i guess they had to filename to get the cat
tap07a_916.882_16.66.wav_ASR	um uh there's a wall of water
tap07a_935.214_9.21.wav_ASR	ah the curve um was in it
tap07a_946.984_13.22.wav_ASR	and the favour or whatever was trying to get
tap07a_972.202_1.52.wav_ASR	oh really
tap07a_987.038_14.78.wav_ASR	farman and the girlo and the gorilla holding on
tap07a_1008.286_0.36.wav_ASR	yes
tap07a_1019.738_1.03.wav_ASR	then i'm gonna take it

tap18a_338.477_0.6.wav_ASR	everything
tap18a_348.911_0.37.wav_ASR	okay
tap18a_350.845_11.07.wav_ASR	um i'm already in the first i was so impressed
tap18a_363.68_0.96.wav_ASR	and i thought oh okay
tap18a_364.824_1.38.wav_ASR	oh it's in the wheel here
tap18a_367.095_3.49.wav_ASR	that's what i said maybe a can't walk or d it can
tap18a_371.072_3.11.wav_ASR	maybe i can't too s speak again
tap18a_374.852_3.26.wav_ASR	maybe i can't the arm nick and
tap18a_378.493_0.42.wav_ASR	everything
tap18a_379.757_0.39.wav_ASR	okay
tap18a_382.372_1.03.wav_ASR	well i guess i th
tap18a_383.727_1.93.wav_ASR	well i could do it myself
tap18a_387.312_0.82.wav_ASR	in my mind
tap18a_388.863_3.77.wav_ASR	so i i had this personal estimate
tap18a_393.615_9.12.wav_ASR	had a. t. and p. oh t. and p. oh t. and physical television
tap18a_403.974_2.54.wav_ASR	so it worked out a w well already hard
tap18a_407.494_3.78.wav_ASR	and now my se uh ha my i haven't said
tap18a_411.978_2.81.wav_ASR	you get no real chair
tap18a_415.164_0.59.wav_ASR	walk around
tap18a_416.351_0.52.wav_ASR	amazed
tap18a_416.999_0.49.wav_ASR	it's curved
tap18a_418.155_0.78.wav_ASR	oh i don't think so
tap18a_419.182_0.54.wav_ASR	oh it's
tap18a_420.264_0.71.wav_ASR	so i did
tap18a_422.079_8.65.wav_ASR	and now that um i um i did a f wrong wheel chair
tap18a_431.478_5.2.wav_ASR	like one or three wheels
tap18a_439.57_2.31.wav_ASR	it that i tha i had that
tap18a_442.626_1.04.wav_ASR	yeah i this one
tap18a_444.683_5.92.wav_ASR	almost i did this i i can do no kind sometimes
tap18a_455.158_0.42.wav_ASR	yes
tap18a_456.905_1.17.wav_ASR	and speech of course
tap18a_478.259_0.46.wav_ASR	guys
tap18a_479.725_2.65.wav_ASR	um i had two boys
tap18a_483.6_0.91.wav_ASR	hit here
tap18a_486.202_1.43.wav_ASR	um that's good
tap18a_489.704_2.82.wav_ASR	two boys um on the army
tap18a_493.573_3.75.wav_ASR	one to one one to ten dollars
tap18a_497.937_2.35.wav_ASR	one one to draw
tap18a_501.594_4.13.wav_ASR	um the p boys had got that their armies

tcu02b_857.055_1.21.wav_ASR	yeah
tcu02b_864.736_0.54.wav_ASR	um
tcu02b_865.692_5.48.wav_ASR	am sorry 'cause you uh understand this one uh one uh as say this
tcu02b_872.006_9.35.wav_ASR	okay 'cause it l it'd be for others i can talk like this one no that one it is one
tcu02b_881.652_7.06.wav_ASR	but uh uh uh all the time i try to s uh talk everything but uh
tcu02b_889.406_1.82.wav_ASR	or in english then i do
tcu02b_892.021_1.87.wav_ASR	it's the same and it's
tcu02b_894.381_3.83.wav_ASR	uh i have the problem on i can't talk
tcu02b_900.849_3.95.wav_ASR	it's gonna be better if our tripe
tcu02b_906.83_0.4.wav_ASR	okay
tcu02b_907.723_0.35.wav_ASR	oh
tcu02b_909.374_0.96.wav_ASR	yeah
tcu02b_910.826_2.07.wav_ASR	it can't try more than that this one
tcu02b_930.756_0.36.wav_ASR	oh okay
tcu02b_935.275_0.72.wav_ASR	the end product
tcu02b_937.115_0.38.wav_ASR	okay
tcu02b_937.948_5.68.wav_ASR	the the the curve he had uh is a fruit bowl
tcu02b_944.567_3.68.wav_ASR	because they go the
tcu02b_949.13_2.08.wav_ASR	it can't say this one then
tcu02b_952.46_1.78.wav_ASR	ah i c say this one
tcu02b_954.72_3.94.wav_ASR	the i broke that this one going in any
tcu02b_959.296_4.42.wav_ASR	because in the they hit this one
tcu02b_963.888_1.38.wav_ASR	because like this one
tcu02b_966.367_4.41.wav_ASR	it can't take that n the n uh the number
tcu02b_972.428_1.25.wav_ASR	and they hit this one
tcu02b_974.096_5.5.wav_ASR	because c he call that 'cause that call this one in nee
tcu02b_980.191_6.97.wav_ASR	because the so far far he this one
tcu02b_996.23_0.42.wav_ASR	okay
tcu02b_1007.351_13.73.wav_ASR	um the boys need to go that uh la la go out so this one
tcu02b_1021.574_2.09.wav_ASR	because the man
tcu02b_1026.329_1.069.wav_ASR	use it this one
tcu02b_1028.615_4.06.wav_ASR	the water g um go back this one
tcu02b_1032.838_4.94.wav_ASR	it i it uh s oh see um
tcu02b_1044.602_3.79.wav_ASR	because uh everything no need it
tcu02b_1049.27_4.28.wav_ASR	because he want to try to go out
tcu02b_1055.93_3.97.wav_ASR	uh the water goes back uh down
tcu02b_1060.455_4.23.wav_ASR	because that's why he went back
tcu02b_1065.396_4.91.wav_ASR	the uh sold this one uh the better and uh it
tcu02b_1071.584_4.16.wav_ASR	uh uh hem
tcu02b_1078.519_2.78.wav_ASR	um try this on that i can't get
tcu02b_1082.11_6.59.wav_ASR	because give a to a cat uh water
tcu02b_1115.835_0.67.wav_ASR	okay
tcu02b_1116.553_6.97.wav_ASR	the the boy the main the paint the paint
tcu02b_1124.947_1.17.wav_ASR	oh that
tcu02b_1128.601_5.04.wav_ASR	um the duck try this one in nee
tcu02b_1134.216_4.54.wav_ASR	because uh he tried to be out there
tcu02b_1139.614_6.7.wav_ASR	because um they uh put this one
tcu02b_1147.413_1.46.wav_ASR	can't see it
tcu02b_1149.146_0.4.wav_ASR	oh no
tcu02b_1150.062_6.79.wav_ASR	but the um the duck tried to be down
tcu02b_1158.328_6.96.wav_ASR	uh but the cat put uh uh after this one
tcu02b_1165.56_6.39.wav_ASR	because the curve try to go back
tcu02b_1172.397_4.3.wav_ASR	but uh th uh he can be it down
tcu02b_1177.387_10.81.wav_ASR	that's why the fire the two guys tried to go this one to uh get back this one
tcu02b_1189.102_1.23.wav_ASR	tony
tcu02b_1192.71_1.61.wav_ASR	oh i forget this one
tcu02b_1194.92_2.39.wav_ASR	because they sold these one in a
tcu02b_1208.119_0.77.wav_ASR	yeah but
tcu02b_1212.242_2.02.wav_ASR	the idea
tcu02b_1214.323_0.31.wav_ASR	yeah
tcu02b_1217.954_0.35.wav_ASR	okay
tcu02b_1221.06_0.37.wav_ASR	okay
tcu02b_1224.175_0.34.wav_ASR	and
tcu02b_1226.85_0.4.wav_ASR	uh-huh
tcu02b_1228.037_0.33.wav_ASR	yeah
tcu02b_1229.158_4.41.wav_ASR	okay it is the gonna be the same 'cause uh in spongy
tcu02b_1235.181_4.43.wav_ASR	but i have the problem to talk these on and yeah i tried
tcu02b_1239.995_1.07.wav_ASR	uh
tcu02b_1242.406_1.05.wav_ASR	that's right
tcu02b_1245.041_0.38.wav_ASR	yeah
tcu02b_1370.12_0.34.wav_ASR	okay
tcu02b_1370.916_5.65.wav_ASR	uh the
tcu02b_1379.178_2.51.wav_ASR	ah ten
tcu02b_1382.939_5.08.wav_ASR	because he um when a small one like uh
tcu02b_1391.821_4.32.wav_ASR	think this can li like a five years
tcu02b_1397.061_3.87.wav_ASR	um haran as a small one this one
tcu02b_1401.324_2.6.wav_ASR	cause won't forget that
tcu02b_1408.848_1.4.wav_ASR	the the curve
tcu02b_1413.589_8.07.wav_ASR	the cur um the c uh change uh send this one 'cause the house
tcu02b_1421.926_0.88.wav_ASR	yeah
tcu02b_1423.842_16.11.wav_ASR	because um uh the greek speaker um say this one to clean a. v.
tcu02b_1441.5_0.74.wav_ASR	evolution
tcu02b_1443.542_2.49.wav_ASR	uh clean air fresheners
tcu02b_1446.547_5.49.wav_ASR	because um later 'cause got these one
tcu02b_1452.476_7.75.wav_ASR	cos uh th uh the boy um c. e. m.
tcu02b_1460.439_3.28.wav_ASR	because uh check everything
tcu02b_1464.028_3.38.wav_ASR	because it's got oh one
tcu02b_1467.965_7.85.wav_ASR	because uh hell more than that together to be better
tcu02b_1475.865_5.91.wav_ASR	because uh he went to dennis everything
tcu02b_1482.172_1.83.wav_ASR	let's thought these one
tcu02b_1484.498_5.47.wav_ASR	because the first one change uh like a
tcu02b_1490.49_0.39.wav_ASR	the c
tcu02b_1491.384_0.54.wav_ASR	it's not
tcu02b_1493.147_1.8.wav_ASR	the uh use this one
tcu02b_1495.247_15.49.wav_ASR	because um he tried to go out like a triangle
tcu02b_1511.425_0.77.wav_ASR	twelve ninety
tcu02b_1513.018_6.92.wav_ASR	um 'cause he range outside these one to go home
tcu02b_1520.757_3.06.wav_ASR	because next day
tcu02b_1524.622_1.74.wav_ASR	uh i forgot these one
tcu02b_1526.56_1.59.wav_ASR	uh the
tcu02b_1530.048_7.29.wav_ASR	because all the time tried this one if uh it's the same
tcu02b_1538.491_5.75.wav_ASR	because they gonna find this one to get
tcu02b_1547.038_1.44.wav_ASR	okay
tcu02b_1550.85_1.37.wav_ASR	um they
tcu02b_1556.863_1.14.wav_ASR	and it is lip
tcu02b_1558.312_8.22.wav_ASR	oh 'cause uh the body is the main they have uh um
tcu02b_1571.595_0.37.wav_ASR	okay

tcu07a_58.504_2.55.wav_ASR	see you just new 'cause our brother had it
tcu07a_61.6_1.92.wav_ASR	so c. hell
tcu07a_64.11_0.769.wav_ASR	in t. col
tcu07a_64.9_0.74.wav_ASR	but the n. t. k.
tcu07a_65.656_5.22.wav_ASR	are you with uh how is it um to you
tcu07a_70.9_3.37.wav_ASR	the he was in our house that's that's pretty long very long
tcu07a_74.315_1.24.wav_ASR	it's t. c. m.
tcu07a_76.138_0.61.wav_ASR	he is there
tcu07a_77.528_4.12.wav_ASR	and um and it's so funny
tcu07a_82.03_3.09.wav_ASR	uh kate myself uh kept myself in the end
tcu07a_85.47_2.96.wav_ASR	just a cat enough to get the dog and uh
tcu07a_90.338_2.35.wav_ASR	in the after uh i don't mind for anything
tcu07a_94.397_1.61.wav_ASR	yeah and then uh
tcu07a_98.029_0.55.wav_ASR	yeah
tcu07a_98.865_9.01.wav_ASR	and um and i don't know am are anything after that for two d. two
tcu07a_110.575_0.31.wav_ASR	yeah
tcu07a_111.612_4.26.wav_ASR	and then as t as i s i s no you know what was going on in
tcu07a_116.162_2.63.wav_ASR	that just couldn't understand what they're
tcu07a_119.029_2.3.wav_ASR	oh yeah and i just didn't know what they were talking about
tcu07a_121.352_1.93.wav_ASR	and i mean they just you know
tcu07a_124.592_1.89.wav_ASR	yeah they i mean they didn't know anyway
tcu07a_126.5_10.94.wav_ASR	and i mean uh the all told me so far was one doc that d to the dog was just one thing until i could talk to
tcu07a_137.758_1.3.wav_ASR	the beginning and the end
tcu07a_139.078_3.58.wav_ASR	uh i just wouldn't need anything for uh i don't think for me
tcu07a_142.674_1.05.wav_ASR	but there is no
tcu07a_145.779_0.98.wav_ASR	yeah
tcu07a_147.708_0.39.wav_ASR	now
tcu07a_148.577_1.32.wav_ASR	it was all this
tcu07a_150.785_1.31.wav_ASR	yeah no
tcu07a_152.727_1.77.wav_ASR	in um i don't know
tcu07a_154.514_1.02.wav_ASR	oh now i think about that
tcu07a_155.555_8.91.wav_ASR	uh i don't know what uh um but i'm but maybe it's that i can't
tcu07a_165.334_0.61.wav_ASR	uh i don't remember
tcu07a_165.963_6.11.wav_ASR	oh i just know that that i started totally st yeah you know going in and
tcu07a_172.235_1.75.wav_ASR	they started dicking on me
tcu07a_174.0_3.31.wav_ASR	and i started n so it's sort of certain little bit
tcu07a_178.01_2.7.wav_ASR	but there are a lot of things like my name
tcu07a_180.919_4.97.wav_ASR	uh this i mean i just now you know my name
tcu07a_185.908_1.85.wav_ASR	it's uh that was it yeah you know
tcu07a_187.777_1.06.wav_ASR	and uh no you never get it
tcu07a_189.134_2.56.wav_ASR	then people will get oh that easy
tcu07a_192.031_0.89.wav_ASR	but me
tcu07a_200.296_0.34.wav_ASR	yeah
tcu07a_200.964_6.82.wav_ASR	and my ne in uh name and name a name a name a name a name a name a name a name a name a name a name a name a name a name a name a name a name a name a name a name a name a name a name a name a name a name a name a name a name a name a name a name a name a name a name a name a name a name a name a name a name a name a name a name a name a name a name a name a name a name a name a name a name a name a name a name a name a name a name a name a name a name a name a name a name a
tcu07a_208.7_5.2.wav_ASR	and i mean the other thing that you wanna know is my um
tcu07a_215.061_0.83.wav_ASR	ah i don't remember
tcu07a_215.906_3.67.wav_ASR	uh i can't remi remember a lot of thing
tcu07a_219.6_1.14.wav_ASR	the g yes i guess a
tcu07a_221.351_6.26.wav_ASR	it's so they this in every um totally slowly i've been totally doing it
tcu07a_227.633_2.48.wav_ASR	uh i mean uh they wouldn't nee
tcu07a_236.428_2.45.wav_ASR	um i don't know
tcu07a_239.174_1.82.wav_ASR	and uh and now do you think about it i don't know
tcu07a_241.134_0.35.wav_ASR	then i don't know
tcu07a_244.801_0.45.wav_ASR	okay
tcu07a_252.532_0.39.wav_ASR	yeah that
tcu07a_252.946_1.09.wav_ASR	okay so you c
tcu07a_261.678_10.64.wav_ASR	um well they've been going in in the uh i mean i'm going to the um i'll in the um
tcu07a_275.306_3.41.wav_ASR	oh um the um the
tcu07a_278.941_5.81.wav_ASR	they s th i d uh threes they have they have me
tcu07a_284.77_5.06.wav_ASR	and the i mean they're in the they um c. v. for the
tcu07a_289.849_2.0.wav_ASR	they uh do the uh every m
tcu07a_292.232_6.95.wav_ASR	uh i can talk oh every three min three days a t the again
tcu07a_299.2_1.1.wav_ASR	in the materials
tcu07a_300.459_2.54.wav_ASR	and uh talk and talk it up
tcu07a_303.189_9.4.wav_ASR	so um i do find out feel that when i g go with my band that it helps some
tcu07a_312.787_1.43.wav_ASR	yeah i find that uh
tcu07a_314.811_3.77.wav_ASR	it seems like every time i a little bit more you know
tcu07a_318.6_0.53.wav_ASR	so
tcu07a_320.674_0.42.wav_ASR	yeah
tcu07a_322.153_0.55.wav_ASR	yeah
tcu07a_358.045_6.12.wav_ASR	um not a n uh not a t top of 'em but i yeah
tcu07a_365.261_1.33.wav_ASR	yeah the banana
tcu07a_367.6_2.3.wav_ASR	but it's hard to think of the the
tcu07a_370.3_3.58.wav_ASR	um um i
tcu07a_374.981_1.26.wav_ASR	yeah probably
tcu07a_378.643_0.4.wav_ASR	now
tcu07a_386.09_0.55.wav_ASR	yeah
tcu07a_387.006_0.82.wav_ASR	that's a good one
tcu07a_390.512_0.62.wav_ASR	oh
tcu07a_391.301_5.4.wav_ASR	um um he um he he gives me a lot yeah
tcu07a_396.719_2.71.wav_ASR	uh i mean he uh didn't have a
tcu07a_401.411_5.31.wav_ASR	but um they keep the l a lot of time for me
tcu07a_408.237_4.18.wav_ASR	um
tcu07a_413.77_2.46.wav_ASR	and then i don't think what else i can draw
tcu07a_422.86_7.74.wav_ASR	um well i don't know if i can um
tcu07a_431.851_1.14.wav_ASR	kinetic
tcu07a_433.5_4.17.wav_ASR	it's it's ca it is not hard to bun it's a band thing
tcu07a_437.686_2.63.wav_ASR	it's hard to talk a lot of things
tcu07a_440.368_3.96.wav_ASR	um i don't think who else can who can
tcu07a_445.416_6.7.wav_ASR	uh no my d my uh i know well i don't no they uh i know they but i don't understand that i don't
tcu07a_454.244_1.07.wav_ASR	they it's fine
tcu07a_455.33_6.1.wav_ASR	they'd they'd all my friends i know that i'm m memory things
tcu07a_462.238_2.28.wav_ASR	and but i don't remember
tcu07a_464.828_0.52.wav_ASR	and no
tcu07a_465.853_0.65.wav_ASR	it's weird
tcu07a_473.491_1.459.wav_ASR	uh i can't understand you know
tcu07a_474.967_2.21.wav_ASR	it don't i'm a rabbit but a down
tcu07a_477.224_2.28.wav_ASR	yeah but i'm no i know it
tcu07a_481.185_1.145.wav_ASR	but i don't know
tcu07a_499.703_0.49.wav_ASR	okay
tcu07a_500.888_2.29.wav_ASR	um there is a da
tcu07a_505.634_2.07.wav_ASR	we had my da da
tcu07a_508.455_0.94.wav_ASR	we have a
tcu07a_512.279_0.63.wav_ASR	we have
tcu07a_514.114_1.27.wav_ASR	okay
tcu07a_516.746_6.841.wav_ASR	we have a c roo boy who um
tcu07a_523.823_5.47.wav_ASR	he bu he did here is he is doing his
tcu07a_530.721_3.18.wav_ASR	you would only in your dog i mean you hit that uh-huh
tcu07a_535.111_2.87.wav_ASR	and he w yeah
tcu07a_538.17_2.34.wav_ASR	and yeah he i
tcu07a_541.2_5.12.wav_ASR	he went his got his pen
tcu07a_547.025_3.51.wav_ASR	you want to the design um
tcu07a_552.581_9.56.wav_ASR	and they uh in it you drew and d draw onto the to the d yeah here
tcu07a_563.166_6.88.wav_ASR	in in the da da
tcu07a_571.77_0.61.wav_ASR	okay
tcu07a_574.061_11.43.wav_ASR	the the was gave gave gave it and bad now what was going on
tcu07a_585.595_0.57.wav_ASR	now
tcu07a_591.788_0.35.wav_ASR	okay
tcu07a_601.0_0.36.wav_ASR	okay
tcu07a_602.696_0.46.wav_ASR	okay
tcu07a_603.992_8.79.wav_ASR	the m there was a matter and our bit yeah
tcu07a_615.423_20.75.wav_ASR	and he was um giving her uh to the to take the t tell her to to the god to take it
tcu07a_637.149_2.45.wav_ASR	it's so um
tcu07a_642.247_0.35.wav_ASR	it's a c
tcu07a_642.854_1.48.wav_ASR	well i don't need it
tcu07a_645.573_10.02.wav_ASR	and so he started at that you got g got gooey guy
tcu07a_656.225_7.02.wav_ASR	and he started that and realised that he was he needed it he needed it he needed it
tcu07a_663.668_10.2.wav_ASR	so i i it was uh he d got the ch he got the thing from m m
tcu07a_674.299_13.15.wav_ASR	and and now he get me uh he get me you get me he got a he got a he got a he got a he got a thing yeah
tcu07a_705.629_0.55.wav_ASR	okay
tcu07a_706.919_0.66.wav_ASR	there is
tcu07a_709.213_4.84.wav_ASR	you is ta ta he is dacking docking
tcu07a_714.105_3.62.wav_ASR	maybe he's t ta uh working back
tcu07a_718.686_2.0.wav_ASR	and he is
tcu07a_722.226_6.54.wav_ASR	but he was he was had is it d and i had his thing up
tcu07a_729.621_0.69.wav_ASR	and he fell
tcu07a_730.508_2.92.wav_ASR	it's the more he is uh his thing
tcu07a_734.264_6.18.wav_ASR	it's so no he's just a p. in the uh by himself
tcu07a_741.603_4.92.wav_ASR	and so he uh somebody told
tcu07a_747.232_5.05.wav_ASR	and so now he's m he's uh man is coming up
tcu07a_752.706_2.87.wav_ASR	and they're gonna get the t to uh that
tcu07a_756.359_2.18.wav_ASR	the thing you had the thing up
tcu07a_759.12_5.13.wav_ASR	so he can take his own uh make it down a man
tcu07a_766.256_4.05.wav_ASR	but the reason even means he is on here the d
tcu07a_771.091_5.47.wav_ASR	but 'cause the i got a banana and then that was having to help her
tcu07a_777.474_8.41.wav_ASR	with the the dog a bit b yeah
tcu07a_786.29_0.77.wav_ASR	it can't think of it
tcu07a_788.525_7.26.wav_ASR	um and um and that how the w in the anyway
tcu07a_796.339_5.59.wav_ASR	but it ended up he m did it be the one that was in
tcu07a_803.428_0.37.wav_ASR	okay
tcu07a_810.884_0.43.wav_ASR	yeah
tcu07a_817.503_0.34.wav_ASR	yeah
tcu07a_822.929_1.62.wav_ASR	mine yourself of the details
tcu07a_824.817_0.32.wav_ASR	uh-huh
tcu07a_829.258_0.31.wav_ASR	okay
tcu07a_832.777_0.33.wav_ASR	okay
tcu07a_923.902_0.54.wav_ASR	okay
tcu07a_932.792_1.57.wav_ASR	okay um
tcu07a_936.625_3.32.wav_ASR	um she is a um s
tcu07a_943.222_1.11.wav_ASR	and a t. v. but
tcu07a_947.118_4.63.wav_ASR	ce uh a he is a
tcu07a_955.779_0.59.wav_ASR	oh mean yeah
tcu07a_956.619_4.65.wav_ASR	he was um he was
tcu07a_969.306_4.23.wav_ASR	and in there uh anyway hur hur
tcu07a_974.209_3.69.wav_ASR	he did it m. b. um
tcu07a_978.898_11.55.wav_ASR	they were all three kinda wait kinda take the g j gonna go to the
tcu07a_991.517_2.85.wav_ASR	it was a dual um
tcu07a_995.165_3.1.wav_ASR	and they wouldn't let her
tcu07a_999.781_0.87.wav_ASR	so they went
tcu07a_1001.665_2.88.wav_ASR	and it's and in c. v. s a n
tcu07a_1004.567_11.65.wav_ASR	and in our c this ready our r is like a m um his uh thing um his uh button
tcu07a_1016.234_0.87.wav_ASR	oh yeah yeah
tcu07a_1017.905_4.8.wav_ASR	and so she d did a thing on it
tcu07a_1023.107_4.01.wav_ASR	and he and and so he rant it's he he rant
tcu07a_1028.26_2.54.wav_ASR	and he could do it for so long
tcu07a_1031.136_3.36.wav_ASR	and then and then he uh he had to get 'em out
tcu07a_1034.922_4.78.wav_ASR	because he would be t a tera well to to go back into the
tcu07a_1040.481_1.68.wav_ASR	he would design
tcu07a_1043.239_4.609.wav_ASR	so after the after that uh he left
tcu07a_1051.113_2.61.wav_ASR	he not her behind
tcu07a_1054.499_2.85.wav_ASR	so he did he tied the pendanger
tcu07a_1058.294_7.77.wav_ASR	and they had to t d uh you had to take everybody
tcu07a_1066.532_4.0.wav_ASR	and he fi finally s t d fall down a m
tcu07a_1070.549_1.74.wav_ASR	is she is the one
tcu07a_1072.994_5.63.wav_ASR	and they were in p in various
tcu07a_1078.898_1.38.wav_ASR	oh
tcu07a_1090.586_7.4.wav_ASR	um i would get a get a get a get the
tcu07a_1102.225_1.53.wav_ASR	it no
tcu07a_1104.859_11.83.wav_ASR	it would um get the two two things of of of wha we uh red red yeah

thompson04a_1278.027_0.98.wav_ASR	oh
thompson04a_1279.826_3.6.wav_ASR	but he's got this to get her to get her
thompson04a_1289.102_0.69.wav_ASR	it's a
thompson04a_1292.985_2.57.wav_ASR	that could be it's
thompson04a_1296.055_0.38.wav_ASR	oh okay
thompson04a_1298.501_0.39.wav_ASR	okay
thompson04a_1309.763_2.27.wav_ASR	oh
thompson04a_1316.034_0.91.wav_ASR	well certainly
thompson04a_1324.377_3.66.wav_ASR	oh i think everybody else does that
thompson04a_1328.059_3.04.wav_ASR	yeah i th yeah
thompson04a_1351.601_0.4.wav_ASR	oh
thompson04a_1352.919_0.46.wav_ASR	uh-huh
thompson04a_1685.2_0.45.wav_ASR	oh
thompson04a_1687.735_11.25.wav_ASR	well this is
thompson04a_1700.423_8.07.wav_ASR	and she's taking that
thompson04a_1708.669_13.89.wav_ASR	and oh well it's going to be a
thompson04a_1723.614_0.5.wav_ASR	oh
thompson04a_1747.467_0.66.wav_ASR	the other
thompson04a_1750.144_3.34.wav_ASR	daughters and the
thompson04a_1755.248_5.73.wav_ASR	and they're going to do this
thompson04a_1761.0_3.22.wav_ASR	so i have all this stuff
thompson04a_1766.176_5.85.wav_ASR	and she was looking at the the thing
thompson04a_1773.503_0.8.wav_ASR	let's see
thompson04a_1774.318_1.56.wav_ASR	oh no no
thompson04a_1782.4_4.34.wav_ASR	she was looking for the
thompson04a_1786.938_15.74.wav_ASR	and that was it where they went to the to the
thompson04a_1826.646_3.98.wav_ASR	nei about that
thompson04a_1831.59_4.61.wav_ASR	but this is
thompson04a_1843.36_0.8.wav_ASR	let me see
thompson04a_1848.737_1.66.wav_ASR	oh
thompson04a_1855.562_1.36.wav_ASR	oh
thompson04a_1861.631_0.49.wav_ASR	oh
thompson04a_1864.415_5.88.wav_ASR	ro oh uh um
thompson04a_1871.666_0.43.wav_ASR	oh
thompson04a_1873.192_0.9.wav_ASR	yeah
thompson04a_1874.255_1.48.wav_ASR	yeah
thompson04a_1876.295_12.54.wav_ASR	and with the
thompson04a_1890.277_9.22.wav_ASR	and then obviously
thompson04a_1900.192_2.05.wav_ASR	and they have nothing
thompson04a_1902.444_7.88.wav_ASR	and then suddenly
thompson04a_1913.285_2.58.wav_ASR	and she came back in
thompson04a_1916.929_3.56.wav_ASR	but for the
thompson04a_1921.575_12.74.wav_ASR	and that that they got all of this together
thompson04a_1936.114_5.23.wav_ASR	and all and they uh one or two
thompson04a_1943.135_3.14.wav_ASR	oh think this is
thompson04a_1946.752_2.06.wav_ASR	really
thompson04a_1949.304_0.86.wav_ASR	now
thompson04a_1953.075_0.59.wav_ASR	yeah
thompson04a_1955.74_0.69.wav_ASR	oh
thompson04a_1960.875_4.32.wav_ASR	oh that's that
thompson04a_1966.733_0.86.wav_ASR	yeah
thompson04a_1969.225_2.6.wav_ASR	oh
thompson04a_1972.089_4.73.wav_ASR	then you had uh they had that
thompson04a_1976.918_1.61.wav_ASR	oh i thought
thompson04a_1979.546_0.51.wav_ASR	oh yeah
thompson04a_1980.08_0.65.wav_ASR	let's
thompson04a_1981.881_0.43.wav_ASR	ah
thompson04a_1983.803_0.98.wav_ASR	yeah
thompson04a_1984.798_0.8.wav_ASR	yes
thompson04a_2002.117_11.38.wav_ASR	oh i guess one i have to do is yeah
thompson04a_2015.25_3.53.wav_ASR	and they have to go back and
thompson04a_2018.801_1.79.wav_ASR	and they get back
thompson04a_2021.15_2.01.wav_ASR	and they say right back here
thompson04a_2025.804_3.67.wav_ASR	they go into the
thompson04a_2031.163_4.17.wav_ASR	and they had good good
thompson04a_2035.492_0.35.wav_ASR	yeah
thompson04a_2036.692_0.51.wav_ASR	cool
thompson04a_2042.043_0.49.wav_ASR	triple
thompson04a_2089.601_0.341.wav_ASR	yeah
thompson04a_2090.117_1.359.wav_ASR	it's yeah
thompson04a_2092.252_0.46.wav_ASR	okay
thompson04a_2093.788_3.53.wav_ASR	and then they would have had a right here
thompson04a_2097.728_1.52.wav_ASR	and then they first
thompson04a_2101.221_1.23.wav_ASR	oh what we do
thompson04a_2102.58_5.8.wav_ASR	we had to do the
thompson04a_2108.838_1.47.wav_ASR	and then they have
thompson04a_2113.759_1.53.wav_ASR	oh what i want
thompson04a_2116.369_3.57.wav_ASR	oh
thompson04a_2120.865_3.46.wav_ASR	and then i had the the ch
thompson04a_2126.315_1.21.wav_ASR	yeah i think it's it
thompson04a_2128.62_0.83.wav_ASR	oh

tucson17a_1065.547_3.18.wav_ASR	yeah yes yes
tucson17a_1084.343_6.17.wav_ASR	oh the little bit of a rabbit and it's yellow
tucson17a_1091.135_8.71.wav_ASR	and send with um um um two um
tucson17a_1100.705_0.86.wav_ASR	okay
tucson17a_1102.921_9.95.wav_ASR	um p. n. r. b uh um and sellable
tucson17a_1115.13_0.54.wav_ASR	and
tucson17a_1118.72_10.58.wav_ASR	oh that one that uh that a red and black and yellow
UCL02a_6.639_0.36.wav_ASR	yeah
UCL02a_11.585_0.35.wav_ASR	oh
UCL02a_13.404_4.57.wav_ASR	so just talk about my my speech and how it is today this week or
UCL02a_18.68_2.04.wav_ASR	well it could be today or we all the pens yeah
UCL02a_25.837_2.86.wav_ASR	um my speech and this talking today
UCL02a_31.699_1.62.wav_ASR	um
UCL02a_34.593_2.69.wav_ASR	um you don't know why do you don't know
UCL02a_37.33_2.09.wav_ASR	so sometimes sometimes it's brilliant this morning isn't it
UCL02a_39.439_0.94.wav_ASR	that's the screen
UCL02a_40.4_0.93.wav_ASR	it's brilliant isn't it today
UCL02a_43.429_1.1.wav_ASR	speech you can be good
UCL02a_44.544_1.86.wav_ASR	sometimes i can't understand talk
UCL02a_47.789_2.6.wav_ASR	um not here what's happening about me now
UCL02a_50.411_1.47.wav_ASR	can um
UCL02a_53.073_3.41.wav_ASR	you know this happens to me a bit problem because sometimes suddenly one word is just go
UCL02a_56.5_1.63.wav_ASR	um you know that that
UCL02a_58.449_1.89.wav_ASR	oh i can't remember that now now i can't remember
UCL02a_61.489_4.3.wav_ASR	some weeks i'm pu um i think i can hear about everything
UCL02a_66.983_3.54.wav_ASR	um um i can hear everything
UCL02a_70.775_5.62.wav_ASR	uh and then suddenly we can just just um disappears that i mean now
UCL02a_77.532_0.76.wav_ASR	it's hard to tell
UCL02a_78.308_2.25.wav_ASR	sometimes suddenly one day it can be perfect
UCL02a_81.517_1.77.wav_ASR	well not perfect i mean but it is decent
UCL02a_83.309_5.47.wav_ASR	then sometimes it's um um i just can't hear some things you know
UCL02a_88.8_1.82.wav_ASR	that's a difficult thing but with the speech
UCL02a_92.492_4.69.wav_ASR	um uh then on top of sometimes it's it's okay
UCL02a_97.24_3.13.wav_ASR	and then of course suddenly one word is just disappearing for me as well
UCL02a_100.812_1.34.wav_ASR	oh
UCL02a_102.173_0.54.wav_ASR	that's okay
UCL02a_103.893_3.39.wav_ASR	and then suddenly one word is brilliant for speaking to to speak everybody
UCL02a_107.33_0.65.wav_ASR	it's good for me
UCL02a_108.7_2.11.wav_ASR	and then suddenly just make me so tired
UCL02a_111.006_1.62.wav_ASR	oh not tired but then i just can't hear
UCL02a_112.82_1.55.wav_ASR	it's difficult to tell you know
UCL02a_115.317_8.88.wav_ASR	um yeah um i'm gonna talk about this well
UCL02a_124.218_1.15.wav_ASR	so only things about me as well
UCL02a_125.597_8.35.wav_ASR	um i try anyway about my speech into everybody
UCL02a_134.03_3.34.wav_ASR	um sometimes it's brilliant
UCL02a_137.419_4.91.wav_ASR	one people are talking to me and then um i guess that what they're talking to me is
UCL02a_142.345_3.14.wav_ASR	and i think maybe one little word is g is disappeared from me now
UCL02a_146.052_0.98.wav_ASR	one word is gone
UCL02a_147.699_2.65.wav_ASR	and then sometimes it's just turtle one i can't see anything
UCL02a_151.038_4.42.wav_ASR	um
UCL02a_155.949_12.23.wav_ASR	um sometimes the bad thing is sometimes where is you know you c i can't do anything for me
UCL02a_168.2_1.91.wav_ASR	that's that's bit bad i'm making a figure so
UCL02a_171.11_1.02.wav_ASR	it's very difficult for me
UCL02a_172.344_1.12.wav_ASR	because it's difficult sometimes
UCL02a_173.565_1.16.wav_ASR	that's when you really paint with
UCL02a_175.216_2.16.wav_ASR	you can't speak to my
UCL02a_177.398_0.78.wav_ASR	forget to remember
UCL02a_178.199_1.64.wav_ASR	that's very difficult especially like that
UCL02a_180.635_5.7.wav_ASR	um uh and you get um refreshing festing
UCL02a_186.35_0.66.wav_ASR	think i think that yeah
UCL02a_187.33_0.32.wav_ASR	oh yeah
UCL02a_188.404_3.4.wav_ASR	well um that can be terrible sometimes
UCL02a_192.01_4.9.wav_ASR	um sometimes like um
UCL02a_198.705_2.08.wav_ASR	develop for me about what talking as well
UCL02a_200.83_1.55.wav_ASR	so i'm now reading books
UCL02a_202.4_2.79.wav_ASR	so you'd have to read a lot things you know before i did my stroke okay
UCL02a_205.21_1.04.wav_ASR	but i read a lot of books
UCL02a_206.693_3.1.wav_ASR	now is difficult for me is why i'm speaking but my box to me
UCL02a_210.781_7.56.wav_ASR	and the awful thing for me is sometimes i'm not sure so what i'm talking about
UCL02a_218.619_3.13.wav_ASR	the half the pages are reading about and then suddenly
UCL02a_222.2_2.17.wav_ASR	good yes that's pretty for i'm reading about that
UCL02a_224.65_1.38.wav_ASR	then suddenly one brain helps
UCL02a_226.05_0.43.wav_ASR	just go
UCL02a_226.69_0.88.wav_ASR	it's terrible as well
UCL02a_228.468_4.2.wav_ASR	so many time i'm reading again and i can't am i'm not talking about the time before
UCL02a_232.729_1.01.wav_ASR	oh this is terrible you know
UCL02a_234.485_8.7.wav_ASR	um um yeah that could have something as well like what i'm watching films and things like that for me as well
UCL02a_243.916_13.13.wav_ASR	um well watching films or um d. v. d. d. d. v. d. s sometimes um i have to watch everything to su uh to sub titles
UCL02a_258.261_9.22.wav_ASR	um that has to be as well like supplements and uh i i w the the d. v. d. s and uh the next day again or something like that
UCL02a_268.09_0.94.wav_ASR	so things are again
UCL02a_269.046_0.67.wav_ASR	that's quite good
UCL02a_270.468_3.7.wav_ASR	um 'cause i can't what they're talking about w that a false um
UCL02a_274.691_5.27.wav_ASR	um sub tools are really good for me um important for my work as well
UCL02a_282.717_3.23.wav_ASR	um uh then of course what happened to me with my stroke as well
UCL02a_285.97_2.58.wav_ASR	of course um you know i did a lot with classical music
UCL02a_288.565_1.94.wav_ASR	that was the concept so um
UCL02a_292.355_5.18.wav_ASR	that's the um all the classical music classical music plays
UCL02a_297.553_2.03.wav_ASR	how's it looking up in germany and Spain and things like that
UCL02a_299.599_4.57.wav_ASR	that's one of the thing i was doing is the management uh of all the corporate manager thing with me is that
UCL02a_305.791_4.38.wav_ASR	uh at least my um my classical music is there thank god
UCL02a_311.267_2.23.wav_ASR	um but strange me they haven't to me
UCL02a_314.212_3.28.wav_ASR	um i can hear the words perfectly above
UCL02a_317.508_1.67.wav_ASR	all the sound of the music is that
UCL02a_319.2_1.21.wav_ASR	and here i think perfectly
UCL02a_320.824_0.96.wav_ASR	that's not supposed to be
UCL02a_322.053_0.66.wav_ASR	yeah is that
UCL02a_323.079_2.0.wav_ASR	what i can see that movie is
UCL02a_325.1_0.75.wav_ASR	and here it is well
UCL02a_326.28_0.58.wav_ASR	but it can't say
UCL02a_327.06_3.92.wav_ASR	that's a bit of like um you know it's a bit of a base open and that dat dat
UCL02a_331.0_0.95.wav_ASR	ah i can see what that
UCL02a_332.315_0.63.wav_ASR	and then suddenly
UCL02a_333.511_1.24.wav_ASR	yeah would that be a bad
UCL02a_334.876_1.23.wav_ASR	it was the panball battery's play
UCL02a_336.218_1.82.wav_ASR	that's only one word is just gone for me
UCL02a_339.028_2.35.wav_ASR	um you have to get a pattern about it
UCL02a_341.4_0.32.wav_ASR	oh that
UCL02a_341.803_0.93.wav_ASR	uh
UCL02a_342.829_1.91.wav_ASR	you know i can remember the word up here is there
UCL02a_344.964_0.93.wav_ASR	can't help in all of that
UCL02a_347.417_4.47.wav_ASR	um but the classical music as well thank god for me as well
UCL02a_351.907_3.12.wav_ASR	um i mean thanks um my music there as well as uh you know
UCL02a_355.5_1.15.wav_ASR	for the setting just now
UCL02a_357.482_1.78.wav_ASR	and reading the books can be difficult for me
UCL02a_360.193_2.99.wav_ASR	um the films i need the sub titles
UCL02a_363.263_3.04.wav_ASR	but then with the beautiful it's brilliant thanks god i mean you know
UCL02a_367.126_5.98.wav_ASR	um nearly things happened with me in my in my phase yeah and things like that a couple of people as well
UCL02a_373.127_1.85.wav_ASR	and i think about a bit more useful as well
UCL02a_374.999_1.1.wav_ASR	but i hope speech is better
UCL02a_376.116_0.31.wav_ASR	oh
UCL02a_376.48_0.38.wav_ASR	that's it
UCL02a_377.882_5.1.wav_ASR	um okay
UCL02a_383.006_1.68.wav_ASR	it's a little things as well you know
UCL02a_384.93_2.72.wav_ASR	um some little things but
UCL02a_388.125_1.06.wav_ASR	yes but it
UCL02a_394.094_1.97.wav_ASR	yeah me on the other hand that i'm not gonna yeah
UCL02a_397.44_1.06.wav_ASR	what happened
UCL02a_399.855_1.57.wav_ASR	well that was in the f worst
UCL02a_402.334_3.75.wav_ASR	it's the it's the um twenty uh the fifteen yeah
UCL02a_407.543_0.84.wav_ASR	potentially the fifteen
UCL02a_408.4_1.08.wav_ASR	yeah it's making sense to that yeah
UCL02a_409.58_2.56.wav_ASR	let's the o. but for four years then
UCL02a_414.5_2.34.wav_ASR	yeah i suppose the th what i really remember is really strange for you
UCL02a_416.862_0.77.wav_ASR	you used the e.
UCL02a_417.65_1.01.wav_ASR	now i got to work
UCL02a_419.58_2.06.wav_ASR	and it's about nine thirteen in the morning
UCL02a_422.308_1.74.wav_ASR	uh phase is in the t in the tune
UCL02a_424.068_1.71.wav_ASR	and then i'm gonna catch my bus
UCL02a_427.382_1.25.wav_ASR	and they got there into work
UCL02a_429.05_1.69.wav_ASR	and i imagine it's really strange
UCL02a_432.378_3.07.wav_ASR	um i'm gonna go on to my computer
UCL02a_436.506_0.97.wav_ASR	and then suddenly
UCL02a_437.5_2.4.wav_ASR	yeah i just s that's can switch my computer switch it on
UCL02a_440.439_4.99.wav_ASR	and i could imagine what is um how can i use my computer
UCL02a_445.929_3.87.wav_ASR	that's my my my code you know you're you're writing things
UCL02a_450.603_0.68.wav_ASR	come on where is it
UCL02a_451.3_1.04.wav_ASR	could i put it under that
UCL02a_452.404_0.36.wav_ASR	so
UCL02a_454.288_1.27.wav_ASR	that is my colour
UCL02a_455.628_0.46.wav_ASR	so let's see
UCL02a_456.246_7.3.wav_ASR	and haran i mean um um i can't remember how to use my computer and things like that
UCL02a_464.158_1.26.wav_ASR	and then she suddenly noticed
UCL02a_465.465_2.41.wav_ASR	he said to me i wasn't a bit strange me as well
UCL02a_468.953_0.57.wav_ASR	that's the most important
UCL02a_470.161_1.38.wav_ASR	okay the that that uh
UCL02a_471.8_0.6.wav_ASR	oh but i thought
UCL02a_474.207_0.79.wav_ASR	just for example
UCL02a_475.017_1.76.wav_ASR	and walking around and things like that you know
UCL02a_476.8_2.11.wav_ASR	it's still my brain is um
UCL02a_480.117_4.99.wav_ASR	and i just could remember how what computer was and going down stars and things like that and that that
UCL02a_485.795_3.66.wav_ASR	and suddenly some friends that are talking to me and they were talking to me
UCL02a_489.477_2.9.wav_ASR	and i couldn't what they were but they were talking to me
UCL02a_494.892_2.06.wav_ASR	and then a friend of mine and then she said
UCL02a_497.05_1.56.wav_ASR	yeah i'm gonna let you sort of that as well
UCL02a_499.0_1.51.wav_ASR	and um she called
UCL02a_501.025_2.43.wav_ASR	yes but nine o'clock then the morning
UCL02a_503.787_2.13.wav_ASR	um we'll take over to the household a. n. e.
UCL02a_507.338_1.89.wav_ASR	and i said there for a couple of times as well
UCL02a_509.25_2.01.wav_ASR	and then they're curing for me for now
UCL02a_512.02_0.421.wav_ASR	let's start
UCL02a_512.456_1.29.wav_ASR	oh one guy is talking to me
UCL02a_513.77_1.31.wav_ASR	and there's some other people and
UCL02a_516.39_1.49.wav_ASR	uh then you can use
UCL02a_517.899_1.26.wav_ASR	and then i couldn't speak to him
UCL02a_519.178_1.81.wav_ASR	yeah it's a bit of rubber black rubber
UCL02a_522.583_7.091.wav_ASR	um in order they all these sort of m sandwiches uh things to me
UCL02a_530.449_1.74.wav_ASR	and i could i couldn't speak to
UCL02a_533.17_0.79.wav_ASR	it couldn't speak
UCL02a_534.844_2.64.wav_ASR	well the people were talking to me i couldn't what they were talking to me
UCL02a_537.5_1.32.wav_ASR	accidentally one word yes
UCL02a_539.744_1.17.wav_ASR	the nothing was gone
UCL02a_542.169_5.25.wav_ASR	um yeah that's it
UCL02a_547.468_1.91.wav_ASR	but that doesn't about that's ten in the evening as well
UCL02a_549.43_5.87.wav_ASR	so then yeah it um north north middle six the first day as well
UCL02a_555.32_1.53.wav_ASR	then i said after that was about
UCL02a_557.638_2.43.wav_ASR	as a five or six day um hours
UCL02a_560.666_2.74.wav_ASR	and they move me from there down here to u. c. l. yeah
UCL02a_564.353_1.74.wav_ASR	um
UCL02a_568.078_5.12.wav_ASR	um and that was it as well
UCL02a_573.219_1.35.wav_ASR	yeah i mean you know
UCL02a_575.827_0.89.wav_ASR	remember after that
UCL02a_576.741_1.01.wav_ASR	is it about five hours
UCL02a_577.773_1.11.wav_ASR	then it's it's bit t
UCL02a_579.236_0.55.wav_ASR	then we came up
UCL02a_579.81_3.71.wav_ASR	it's quite um in the evening as well in the household
UCL02a_584.84_3.59.wav_ASR	and people are sc uh on the dots and trying to write for me as well
UCL02a_588.451_4.45.wav_ASR	and it could be that my speech is even worse that f very eating time as well
UCL02a_593.524_2.64.wav_ASR	and the next day is well i just couldn't speak to everybody
UCL02a_597.058_3.09.wav_ASR	and i mean all the holes were there and looking at me and other people pop up
UCL02a_600.25_1.04.wav_ASR	and i couldn't
UCL02a_602.917_2.26.wav_ASR	um i think i remember now
UCL02a_605.262_2.6.wav_ASR	the first the first day if you
UCL02a_608.048_0.74.wav_ASR	it's a bit expensive
UCL02a_608.959_0.82.wav_ASR	it's better
UCL02a_609.799_0.88.wav_ASR	it could speed up
UCL02a_610.7_0.75.wav_ASR	but people look at
UCL02a_611.467_0.48.wav_ASR	and i'd love to
UCL02a_613.201_2.54.wav_ASR	um well people will be talking to me
UCL02a_615.795_4.6.wav_ASR	and i couldn't i couldn't when they're talked to me i couldn't speak to anything
UCL02a_620.505_0.55.wav_ASR	it's
UCL02a_621.961_1.52.wav_ASR	yeah that's the writing down
UCL02a_624.359_1.26.wav_ASR	so the documents say that that that
UCL02a_625.666_1.39.wav_ASR	and i couldn't speak anything as well
UCL02a_628.52_4.16.wav_ASR	um that's the worst for about you know about it change about three or four weeks
UCL02a_632.699_1.28.wav_ASR	oh the number is
UCL02a_634.0_2.21.wav_ASR	uh that would stand uh uh that that that
UCL02a_637.869_2.91.wav_ASR	um and then after that as well
UCL02a_640.8_0.48.wav_ASR	so yes
UCL02a_641.3_2.15.wav_ASR	so the menu is the u. c. l. placing here
UCL02a_644.103_1.81.wav_ASR	and then this place is the recording from here
UCL02a_646.0_0.38.wav_ASR	is it
UCL02a_646.4_5.93.wav_ASR	the um screen screens uh screen square
UCL02a_652.975_4.0.wav_ASR	the new uh new t. r. you know yeah
UCL02a_657.478_1.21.wav_ASR	let's have for two weeks as well
UCL02a_659.32_1.48.wav_ASR	oh they're teletop then
UCL02a_661.705_2.51.wav_ASR	so that n that i'm uh i'm not even sensitive to say that
UCL02a_664.318_1.87.wav_ASR	that's the first day that have me on the first track yeah
UCL02a_675.556_1.58.wav_ASR	that's like getting any better yeah
UCL02a_677.863_3.8.wav_ASR	um it's strange
UCL02a_681.681_3.38.wav_ASR	suppose the next thing for me i suppose that's two weeks after having n
UCL02a_685.08_1.4.wav_ASR	the first s first we c. l.
UCL02a_686.5_1.06.wav_ASR	don't forget to
UCL02a_687.622_3.32.wav_ASR	and then to exist the numerical numerical
UCL02a_691.037_1.37.wav_ASR	oh can't be the first one as well
UCL02a_693.677_2.17.wav_ASR	and i remember there is the first one about two weeks
UCL02a_695.871_6.85.wav_ASR	and then there's some people were testing me up for um like another is for the for the um video
UCL02a_704.304_2.18.wav_ASR	and some later is uh document
UCL02a_706.5_3.48.wav_ASR	it's a lot of telets and things like that and the l. e. d.
UCL02a_712.938_1.25.wav_ASR	and just test me
UCL02a_714.208_1.77.wav_ASR	and you know these features of me
UCL02a_716.0_3.65.wav_ASR	and are these um yeah uh these are cats
UCL02a_719.666_1.46.wav_ASR	uh the docks and things like that
UCL02a_721.149_1.73.wav_ASR	what's this and some other things
UCL02a_723.85_4.47.wav_ASR	um and sometimes i couldn't what you should talk about
UCL02a_728.336_1.86.wav_ASR	now he's just uh said you'd like the future things
UCL02a_730.212_3.77.wav_ASR	is this a dog or no square things and i can't remember what that
UCL02a_738.114_2.95.wav_ASR	then after that about two weeks um another place
UCL02a_741.126_4.6.wav_ASR	and then that was called the s prototype people as well
UCL02a_747.398_2.78.wav_ASR	and the other thing was then one group of people helping me up
UCL02a_750.539_5.96.wav_ASR	um straight communication people having people um helping me for writing some words to me as well
UCL02a_757.561_3.75.wav_ASR	um help me with some words
UCL02a_761.331_3.15.wav_ASR	like you know it's in monday tuesday thursday
UCL02a_764.5_1.42.wav_ASR	the first days i couldn't tell for me
UCL02a_766.211_2.02.wav_ASR	yeah it's in monday tuesday that's the friday
UCL02a_768.626_0.55.wav_ASR	it could remember
UCL02a_769.252_0.9.wav_ASR	is it handy to the
UCL02a_770.176_1.63.wav_ASR	it can speak the word
UCL02a_772.961_6.7.wav_ASR	it's the first day second word third uh second second third four five six
UCL02a_779.679_0.83.wav_ASR	and then i couldn't
UCL02a_781.953_1.63.wav_ASR	um i still don't know what that now
UCL02a_783.712_1.47.wav_ASR	is a one two fifty seven
UCL02a_785.2_1.08.wav_ASR	but a double check in the
UCL02a_786.37_3.78.wav_ASR	but i'm not the first time it's told me is i couldn't speak up
UCL02a_790.171_3.41.wav_ASR	um um you know what today is
UCL02a_793.6_0.79.wav_ASR	what am i
UCL02a_795.524_1.21.wav_ASR	where you uh my going
UCL02a_796.901_1.38.wav_ASR	uh can't write what things are again
UCL02a_799.104_2.08.wav_ASR	that's difficult for me as well you know
UCL02a_801.24_3.72.wav_ASR	um there is some people i suppose f for is about
UCL02a_806.4_3.15.wav_ASR	it's about six yeah it's about six months she was there
UCL02a_810.46_2.21.wav_ASR	every week for me some labour was talking to me
UCL02a_812.693_6.05.wav_ASR	and just you know um reaching some words and um helping out that that that that
UCL02a_818.791_1.44.wav_ASR	that's about two weeks
UCL02a_821.718_4.68.wav_ASR	um and then after that i suppose this should be
UCL02a_826.419_1.74.wav_ASR	that's three weeks and ta ta then
UCL02a_828.767_2.69.wav_ASR	uh might six weeks or nine weeks that yeah
UCL02a_832.093_7.38.wav_ASR	then another nine months and then with you at the u. c. l.
UCL02a_840.063_1.49.wav_ASR	that was you the first test as well
UCL02a_841.662_2.74.wav_ASR	um i suppose that was that
UCL02a_845.928_4.83.wav_ASR	think for me think that i th you know with a stroke on the top you'll just i can walk around
UCL02a_850.827_3.82.wav_ASR	oh but then that's um that's a big problem for my code for me is you know things like that
UCL02a_854.716_0.61.wav_ASR	that's okay
UCL02a_856.337_3.78.wav_ASR	um you know i'll buy the bus and the chips and things like that
UCL02a_860.14_0.69.wav_ASR	that's the f
UCL02a_861.098_3.8.wav_ASR	it could be a pictionary about that you know button on the remote by myself
UCL02a_865.175_1.64.wav_ASR	and not being able to help people as well
UCL02a_867.837_2.54.wav_ASR	um that's a bit weird for me
UCL02a_870.4_4.58.wav_ASR	uh think i was the other people that with the um some people now we with the phase of a p
UCL02a_875.2_1.96.wav_ASR	if you're by yourself a bit panic
UCL02a_877.224_0.68.wav_ASR	wouldn't be a good
UCL02a_878.342_1.19.wav_ASR	and is it can have
UCL02a_881.28_2.41.wav_ASR	um can be wrapped for me sometimes
UCL02a_883.763_1.66.wav_ASR	uh i'm not much better in now
UCL02a_885.443_1.45.wav_ASR	but it can be terrible you know
UCL02a_887.833_4.93.wav_ASR	um that i can't speak what i'm talking about now to other people or you know
UCL02a_893.03_5.1.wav_ASR	um but i suppose after is that is better for me now
UCL02a_898.696_6.84.wav_ASR	but um yeah i mean th physically you walk around
UCL02a_905.56_0.96.wav_ASR	that's fine for me
UCL02a_907.365_2.52.wav_ASR	but it just you know it's my own brain thing as well
UCL02a_909.992_0.51.wav_ASR	uh that we got
UCL02a_911.188_1.79.wav_ASR	so make any changes
UCL02a_940.576_0.67.wav_ASR	so you can use it
UCL02a_941.493_0.61.wav_ASR	just say it
UCL02a_942.392_1.14.wav_ASR	let's say again sorry
UCL02a_948.585_0.9.wav_ASR	that's a little kid
UCL02a_955.002_2.69.wav_ASR	who wants a kid or who wants kid he said
UCL02a_966.107_3.03.wav_ASR	then then uh wha what already happened to me yeah yeah
UCL02a_971.144_7.25.wav_ASR	uh is it make it sense to you d what but b but what's happening to me is a cat or a yeah
UCL02a_978.444_0.75.wav_ASR	oh sorry yeah
UCL02a_979.633_2.56.wav_ASR	two b um i speak the language and things like that or no
UCL02a_986.138_3.38.wav_ASR	yeah
UCL02a_989.538_1.6.wav_ASR	what is now i'm fifty eight
UCL02a_992.535_2.48.wav_ASR	but i'm not as a kid i s lovely when i'm called
UCL02a_995.033_0.71.wav_ASR	it's well
UCL02a_995.761_5.8.wav_ASR	and i'm not about ten ten to thirteen years as a kid
UCL02a_1002.376_7.93.wav_ASR	and i was lucky because um i went just um um i was living in in nobels easily as a kid
UCL02a_1010.322_6.55.wav_ASR	oh i'm a border screen in english but then my dad had his job out in Italy as well
UCL02a_1017.003_0.78.wav_ASR	could be back there as well
UCL02a_1018.974_1.8.wav_ASR	but it's strange you talk about that things happening as well
UCL02a_1020.913_2.78.wav_ASR	but i remember i remember that was
UCL02a_1024.459_3.88.wav_ASR	they also a little bit of garbage as well about twelve years as well but not back in eleven
UCL02a_1029.03_3.799.wav_ASR	and then back to than after it's back to e. t. as well
UCL02a_1033.867_3.061.wav_ASR	um and it's strange so the design is
UCL02a_1038.126_1.02.wav_ASR	it is useful
UCL02a_1039.807_0.56.wav_ASR	ah is it cheap
UCL02a_1040.387_2.99.wav_ASR	we live in newspapers just sort of newspapers
UCL02a_1044.069_3.01.wav_ASR	had a view from the um um
UCL02a_1047.13_2.44.wav_ASR	for what i was the difference you could see um
UCL02a_1053.355_0.79.wav_ASR	the v. c. r. s
UCL02a_1054.307_0.36.wav_ASR	okay
UCL02a_1055.824_2.03.wav_ASR	the v. u. s
UCL02a_1058.851_0.67.wav_ASR	you know all that thing
UCL02a_1060.129_0.32.wav_ASR	oh
UCL02a_1061.36_1.67.wav_ASR	vesi v. v. c. r. s
UCL02a_1063.289_0.95.wav_ASR	it costs the word is
UCL02a_1064.257_1.25.wav_ASR	uh the big for of course
UCL02a_1066.615_3.45.wav_ASR	um i can write about as well
UCL02a_1070.089_2.69.wav_ASR	you know it was quite one of a kind of being a kid up there
UCL02a_1072.85_4.61.wav_ASR	um okay that was good as well but we live not far away from the beach
UCL02a_1077.477_6.2.wav_ASR	but then a little kid walk around and people and vulnerable food and um that's good
UCL02a_1083.7_1.68.wav_ASR	use it to as well as any other shape as well
UCL02a_1085.522_5.86.wav_ASR	but um um many time w uh working to other people as well
UCL02a_1091.399_3.32.wav_ASR	it's quite nice as well because they're more like some other pretty people as well
UCL02a_1094.81_4.37.wav_ASR	but um the screen living the menu of um electronics keys as well
UCL02a_1099.196_0.39.wav_ASR	let's
UCL02a_1099.601_1.44.wav_ASR	is it g little kid trying to get that
UCL02a_1101.086_0.74.wav_ASR	oh let's see let's go
UCL02a_1102.743_1.24.wav_ASR	that was uncomfortable for me as well
UCL02a_1104.0_0.87.wav_ASR	oh i really was lucky
UCL02a_1105.801_5.43.wav_ASR	um and many times as well i remember as well it's the management
UCL02a_1111.66_5.83.wav_ASR	uh because i remember where the names we gave in the other part was no there of the um
UCL02a_1119.401_0.9.wav_ASR	that would be a good
UCL02a_1122.722_0.47.wav_ASR	so that's it
UCL02a_1123.837_4.04.wav_ASR	that lovely place where the um the rooms the rooms there
UCL02a_1129.177_1.12.wav_ASR	poppa poppa
UCL02a_1130.398_0.47.wav_ASR	so it could
UCL02a_1131.367_2.59.wav_ASR	poppy and there are one or two as many times as well
UCL02a_1134.864_5.68.wav_ASR	um another one nee um roo r. r.
UCL02a_1140.562_0.67.wav_ASR	and what as well
UCL02a_1141.249_0.33.wav_ASR	it's
UCL02a_1141.6_0.78.wav_ASR	oh it's a bit more
UCL02a_1142.4_2.07.wav_ASR	but that's beautiful as well than going up there
UCL02a_1146.5_0.73.wav_ASR	it was pretty difficult
UCL02a_1147.45_3.91.wav_ASR	but i don't know if this something was really good to me now or was a good nice feeling
UCL02a_1151.961_1.02.wav_ASR	uh lovely feeling yeah
UCL02a_1153.0_1.95.wav_ASR	that uh that was billions in the case
UCL02a_1155.978_1.45.wav_ASR	that wouldn't make sense as well but
UCL02a_1157.451_2.07.wav_ASR	uh mean itty is absolutely wonderful as well
UCL02a_1159.847_0.73.wav_ASR	it's strange as well
UCL02a_1160.596_0.44.wav_ASR	that's not a p
UCL02a_1161.374_2.5.wav_ASR	yes ten to about thirteen years as fast
UCL02a_1164.139_2.9.wav_ASR	then um my parents have to go back to english
UCL02a_1168.309_0.98.wav_ASR	ah let's see
UCL02a_1169.391_6.21.wav_ASR	and then one i'm finished off to um universal add kings here afterwards
UCL02a_1179.707_0.74.wav_ASR	so yes it's not
UCL02a_1180.518_1.69.wav_ASR	ten years is about ten weeks
UCL02a_1183.37_5.06.wav_ASR	ten is about ten years again or just after that
UCL02a_1188.696_3.17.wav_ASR	so sixteen eighty yeah ninety six
UCL02a_1192.48_1.17.wav_ASR	and i found
UCL02a_1194.89_3.13.wav_ASR	um so about fifteen years as well
UCL02a_1198.222_5.16.wav_ASR	uh th i found out where the old house was staying in apartments in the southern bit
UCL02a_1203.403_7.26.wav_ASR	that was called the um lu karen uh which is a little tiny village outside of naples the very top part
UCL02a_1210.851_1.2.wav_ASR	and i found out where it was
UCL02a_1212.066_0.58.wav_ASR	oh it's better
UCL02a_1213.256_1.62.wav_ASR	little house where we living in that that
UCL02a_1214.9_1.18.wav_ASR	those buttons is a kid
UCL02a_1216.514_5.05.wav_ASR	that's a couple of times as well and um the whole day you look around where it is and find
UCL02a_1221.964_0.68.wav_ASR	be the first
UCL02a_1223.734_3.25.wav_ASR	um um yes
UCL02a_1227.0_0.98.wav_ASR	it's not strange at all
UCL02a_1228.41_4.07.wav_ASR	little thing be written as well but pot holes and things like that
UCL02a_1232.5_1.32.wav_ASR	that's a bit of a problem
UCL02a_1234.704_0.61.wav_ASR	it's it's lovely
UCL02a_1235.413_0.57.wav_ASR	but let's see
UCL02a_1236.0_0.63.wav_ASR	it's not yeah
UCL02a_1236.684_1.21.wav_ASR	that's the reason as well yeah
UCL02a_1286.807_7.87.wav_ASR	and uh i just want to um um a walking uh a writing or something like that yeah
UCL02a_1294.873_1.09.wav_ASR	don't want to speech to me now
UCL02a_1305.334_0.85.wav_ASR	okay right
UCL02a_1306.2_3.5.wav_ASR	is a young kid a little young um young kid
UCL02a_1309.751_1.54.wav_ASR	he's put they're playing with his foot ball
UCL02a_1311.308_7.67.wav_ASR	it's out in the garden not in the garden but in the um the garden yeah the garden
UCL02a_1319.06_0.68.wav_ASR	could be
UCL02a_1320.557_1.02.wav_ASR	spreading with his foot
UCL02a_1321.818_1.27.wav_ASR	uh these are for printing
UCL02a_1323.141_11.15.wav_ASR	but when he's scrolling out with his laptop he scratches into um a glass a window maybe the name or whatever have you
UCL02a_1335.475_4.96.wav_ASR	um and he's hit a hole um in his window
UCL02a_1340.882_4.03.wav_ASR	so is it um when the glass is bad because he smashed into his his pocket
UCL02a_1346.475_4.81.wav_ASR	then his name is then was actually that same into his house
UCL02a_1352.128_1.17.wav_ASR	his name was set up
UCL02a_1353.343_7.07.wav_ASR	and suddenly he could see that his laptop was smashed into his glasses and the window
UCL02a_1361.897_3.71.wav_ASR	um so that is his rubber is im is name
UCL02a_1368.491_8.22.wav_ASR	and the guy is can suddenly see that um he's just seen that he's can see that some has smashed into his window
UCL02a_1377.61_2.64.wav_ASR	um you can't remember with a little ideas and uh is no
UCL02a_1380.38_4.5.wav_ASR	but but the guy can see that the f four is is um missing
UCL02a_1385.553_1.45.wav_ASR	and it can't see what it is
UCL02a_1388.186_6.55.wav_ASR	but you can see obviously there's a big hole there is well in his window and his glass yeah
UCL02a_1396.458_0.67.wav_ASR	that's not in it
UCL02a_1438.78_0.39.wav_ASR	okay
UCL02a_1439.388_5.81.wav_ASR	um the label is got a little um a little kid
UCL02a_1446.441_6.8.wav_ASR	um they they're out they're out with the um
UCL02a_1453.822_0.4.wav_ASR	next project
UCL02a_1454.398_0.82.wav_ASR	it's a rabbit
UCL02a_1456.209_0.53.wav_ASR	the one right
UCL02a_1461.232_1.39.wav_ASR	oh it's a bit speech recognition
UCL02a_1463.637_1.54.wav_ASR	just in the spongy words for now
UCL02a_1469.979_2.08.wav_ASR	young one the young one with a little kit
UCL02a_1472.399_1.74.wav_ASR	and that i'll want to go out
UCL02a_1474.472_2.04.wav_ASR	like can't remember the english word is no
UCL02a_1476.593_1.51.wav_ASR	think about the spanish was now
UCL02a_1483.502_1.02.wav_ASR	can't speech recognition
UCL02a_1484.68_0.42.wav_ASR	it's
UCL02a_1491.231_0.78.wav_ASR	that's engineering work
UCL02a_1493.031_0.77.wav_ASR	english word no
UCL02a_1497.742_5.31.wav_ASR	oh you should
UCL02a_1504.997_1.2.wav_ASR	you have anything that's a spongy board
UCL02a_1506.216_1.49.wav_ASR	uh i can't say the english word for no
UCL02a_1514.282_1.22.wav_ASR	look sorry i can't remember
UCL02a_1516.067_1.7.wav_ASR	and anything the sponsor of this is
UCL02a_1522.5_2.45.wav_ASR	anyway little is okay like this one little little baby kit
UCL02a_1526.546_2.36.wav_ASR	the little baby kit wants to go out to the sun
UCL02a_1528.93_2.3.wav_ASR	and uh and then she goes out with her
UCL02a_1531.249_2.57.wav_ASR	um and he just wants to give away the um
UCL02a_1534.461_2.41.wav_ASR	the idea
UCL02a_1542.572_2.39.wav_ASR	and i don't think the prototype is this little thing anyway anyway
UCL02a_1545.564_0.49.wav_ASR	oh but
UCL02a_1547.152_1.87.wav_ASR	comp what the initial word is is not a name
UCL02a_1550.339_1.76.wav_ASR	oh well a little kid and you want to go out
UCL02a_1552.835_1.13.wav_ASR	little cat wants to walk
UCL02a_1554.256_5.88.wav_ASR	uh as she's going off with her little um uh roo had and a little baby kit
UCL02a_1560.158_1.51.wav_ASR	is he and is he's going on a walk in a minute
UCL02a_1561.686_2.4.wav_ASR	then it's already realised it's started to get wet
UCL02a_1564.243_0.59.wav_ASR	it's a rain
UCL02a_1566.525_4.96.wav_ASR	little baby kid rushes back to school because it's is porring down with rain as well
UCL02a_1573.344_1.59.wav_ASR	and you can have to go back in again
UCL02a_1575.035_1.04.wav_ASR	can you speak to my mom
UCL02a_1576.189_5.16.wav_ASR	and then she can see that little baby dot is she's really wet and pouring with rain
UCL02a_1581.364_2.38.wav_ASR	it's back there as well because it's been very very long
UCL02a_1585.185_1.78.wav_ASR	and now you can't remember what uh
UCL02a_1587.492_1.17.wav_ASR	oh yeah it's almost the word as well
UCL02a_1591.198_3.82.wav_ASR	the line rubber
UCL02a_1595.096_0.87.wav_ASR	yes i remember the word
UCL02a_1595.987_1.45.wav_ASR	it's
UCL02a_1597.647_1.62.wav_ASR	uh i think it's the spanish word as well
UCL02a_1601.498_1.28.wav_ASR	april a apple
UCL02a_1602.8_0.8.wav_ASR	yeah that's it
UCL02a_1604.012_7.42.wav_ASR	so the little baby kid um um as now got a a a battery afterwards
UCL02a_1611.536_5.11.wav_ASR	and he's now that little stop a getting weight because this is rating a lot for last time i suppose well yeah
UCL02a_1617.557_1.16.wav_ASR	yeah
UCL02a_1618.733_0.41.wav_ASR	remember
UCL02a_1619.809_1.47.wav_ASR	uh bracket a br
UCL02a_1621.474_1.83.wav_ASR	gonna think the spanish words as well as no
UCL02a_1624.323_1.51.wav_ASR	but i want to think about the sponsorship as well
UCL02a_1625.854_0.58.wav_ASR	oh maybe that would be
UCL02a_1626.911_1.15.wav_ASR	so it's difficult
UCL02a_1629.167_0.95.wav_ASR	that costs double
UCL02a_1631.164_1.42.wav_ASR	so one word is enough
UCL02a_1660.531_1.79.wav_ASR	for just tell what's been happening now yeah
UCL02a_1671.515_0.47.wav_ASR	it's okay
UCL02a_1672.334_0.67.wav_ASR	so much better
UCL02a_1673.054_4.99.wav_ASR	it's like one's little curve curved little things is
UCL02a_1678.595_1.87.wav_ASR	everything is somebody had is all the time as well
UCL02a_1681.017_1.0.wav_ASR	okay right we'll
UCL02a_1682.541_6.58.wav_ASR	first of all that's a little push button is out in the um up and the three part of the of the three
UCL02a_1690.202_4.11.wav_ASR	there's a little baby cat in the very top of the remote and can't get it to sleep
UCL02a_1694.327_9.2.wav_ASR	um and j uh juju and the cat cannot get into the three because the cat is in the tree in the room where
UCL02a_1703.696_1.84.wav_ASR	and a little bit cheap can see the cat
UCL02a_1705.555_3.09.wav_ASR	uh she's happy uh happy because the cat can get sleepy as well
UCL02a_1710.048_8.58.wav_ASR	little baby kids um it's the baby girl is begetting which is out with her um uh a triple
UCL02a_1719.566_0.85.wav_ASR	oh come on the wood now
UCL02a_1723.364_0.76.wav_ASR	is it a guide then
UCL02a_1724.26_1.49.wav_ASR	think there's some guy is beeping up
UCL02a_1726.06_7.38.wav_ASR	is c is this is gonna help is going to help this guy is gonna help with the cat
UCL02a_1735.207_4.01.wav_ASR	and then i'm gonna help to help the cat out of the tree
UCL02a_1739.86_3.97.wav_ASR	but then there's a big one that is making a lot of noise
UCL02a_1744.072_2.85.wav_ASR	it's he's we're bit scared for all the guy out side
UCL02a_1748.204_1.99.wav_ASR	so the man is up there trying to help with a cat
UCL02a_1751.24_6.61.wav_ASR	um but the other big dog is um making a bit of a bit problem for us
UCL02a_1759.276_15.77.wav_ASR	and top of him as well i imagine he's helped the um the um uh
UCL02a_1775.511_1.42.wav_ASR	it looks more expensive
UCL02a_1779.96_5.2.wav_ASR	um
UCL02a_1787.629_1.09.wav_ASR	okay on all these kids
UCL02a_1789.188_6.61.wav_ASR	um i'm not gonna light that
UCL02a_1795.817_0.59.wav_ASR	and i could
UCL02a_1798.365_1.05.wav_ASR	that's the young people as well
UCL02a_1800.445_6.73.wav_ASR	the um yellow people will still have to help them when they got a problem so with the d. n. e. n. no with the um
UCL02a_1808.09_0.81.wav_ASR	what the hell
UCL02a_1809.637_0.71.wav_ASR	can't see the no
UCL02a_1810.4_0.33.wav_ASR	it's a
UCL02a_1813.715_0.45.wav_ASR	oh well
UCL02a_1814.315_3.93.wav_ASR	well there's a lot hurrying today it's well like a little baby doctor little girls
UCL02a_1818.266_3.66.wav_ASR	just lost where sh our cats and very top of the tree and can't know where it is
UCL02a_1822.322_4.06.wav_ASR	the man is gonna help him help the cat getting out of the tree
UCL02a_1826.967_6.29.wav_ASR	uh big dog is uh barking and making a man in front of it all
UCL02a_1834.028_2.73.wav_ASR	just a lot um um um
UCL02a_1837.122_0.94.wav_ASR	come up with this now
UCL02a_1838.587_1.15.wav_ASR	and i can't remember that as well
UCL02a_1841.049_1.1.wav_ASR	and i'll replace
UCL02a_1842.585_1.87.wav_ASR	can't think about what they doing about
UCL02a_1853.342_0.91.wav_ASR	let's let's see
UCL02a_1855.108_0.31.wav_ASR	it's a god
UCL02a_1855.54_0.88.wav_ASR	oh i can't i can't
UCL02a_1856.441_0.59.wav_ASR	is it difficult isn't
UCL02a_1863.145_1.0.wav_ASR	maybe it's gone
UCL02a_1864.36_1.21.wav_ASR	you just go for that one as well
UCL02a_1866.475_1.31.wav_ASR	and i can't the word in english
UCL02a_1867.995_0.5.wav_ASR	let's see
UCL02a_1868.985_1.68.wav_ASR	and i think about the wood is no
UCL02a_1872.015_0.81.wav_ASR	okay you come on then
UCL02a_1873.207_1.22.wav_ASR	it's okay
UCL02a_1874.704_0.53.wav_ASR	you just listen
UCL02a_1875.352_2.46.wav_ASR	what w what but what's what's what's what's that called
UCL02a_1884.456_1.58.wav_ASR	yes something about a con
UCL02a_1886.054_1.08.wav_ASR	oh the words is gone
UCL02a_1887.659_0.43.wav_ASR	doesn't matter
UCL02a_1888.719_0.43.wav_ASR	is that cost
UCL02a_1890.493_0.6.wav_ASR	still isn't
UCL02a_1891.213_0.45.wav_ASR	but not the costs
UCL02a_1901.902_3.39.wav_ASR	sin uh sin sine r. yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
UCL02a_1907.842_7.14.wav_ASR	yeah i'm not about the less ones uh about the the um the big fat folders and the hell of a people and
UCL02a_1915.0_6.3.wav_ASR	and she leaves a um a glass um
UCL02a_1924.744_0.52.wav_ASR	oh
UCL02a_2128.22_0.79.wav_ASR	that i can remember now
UCL02a_2131.784_1.53.wav_ASR	um yeah of course
UCL02a_2133.333_2.44.wav_ASR	there's there's the some too little keys there's well
UCL02a_2135.819_1.63.wav_ASR	ah but um come up with their oh
UCL02a_2137.5_1.95.wav_ASR	oh i don't know if that's two million in there as well
UCL02a_2139.799_0.94.wav_ASR	uh comment on the
UCL02a_2141.248_2.33.wav_ASR	the elder their daughters or wha
UCL02a_2143.602_12.55.wav_ASR	anyway um there's a two ugly doors as well dollars are staying there as well
UCL02a_2156.6_11.55.wav_ASR	and um the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two the two
UCL02a_2168.498_1.21.wav_ASR	and the girls says well
UCL02a_2171.895_3.09.wav_ASR	and then there's send relay
UCL02a_2175.075_1.21.wav_ASR	that is helping as well as
UCL02a_2176.3_2.6.wav_ASR	is cleaning up and all the stuff that that that that
UCL02a_2179.266_4.97.wav_ASR	 anyway the two r. s um the two layers that are pretty affordable
UCL02a_2184.506_6.38.wav_ASR	they see that there's a letter has arrived from people that the print is gonna help everybody for the for the ball
UCL02a_2192.261_7.4.wav_ASR	um and the two um the upper labels are going over there now as well
UCL02a_2200.823_3.21.wav_ASR	um
UCL02a_2209.14_6.81.wav_ASR	and sender i remember the sender was out to help some people still to helping her can help uh
UCL02a_2216.0_2.47.wav_ASR	was it the sort of um the favourite gonna come around
UCL02a_2218.526_0.53.wav_ASR	carbomb
UCL02a_2220.164_2.64.wav_ASR	some is gonna help a to go to the ball as well
UCL02a_2224.416_2.14.wav_ASR	um anyway i come up with the second word
UCL02a_2226.919_5.81.wav_ASR	it's she was going to um the magic for gaining to the ball itself
UCL02a_2233.872_6.43.wav_ASR	and um is it going to the board
UCL02a_2245.056_1.15.wav_ASR	the power is already gone
UCL02a_2246.267_0.75.wav_ASR	um
UCL02a_2253.207_0.99.wav_ASR	let's go in
UCL02a_2259.656_0.32.wav_ASR	so
UCL02a_2260.0_0.34.wav_ASR	it's cool
UCL02a_2260.628_0.37.wav_ASR	still
UCL02a_2270.759_1.41.wav_ASR	could why this one is gone
UCL02a_2277.844_0.82.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
UCL02a_2288.142_1.14.wav_ASR	but the yes no no yeah
UCL02a_2289.299_3.99.wav_ASR	and then you have to get away because you have to get away by itself by mid night
UCL02a_2294.461_1.89.wav_ASR	and you have to get away there really quickly as well
UCL02a_2296.597_1.87.wav_ASR	now she saw the print
UCL02a_2298.956_0.75.wav_ASR	print support
UCL02a_2299.721_3.63.wav_ASR	and uh he really looked the look of a phone and that that
UCL02a_2303.491_1.06.wav_ASR	he likes the look of it as well
UCL02a_2305.795_2.77.wav_ASR	and then you had to run it all right before it gets rid of
UCL02a_2308.802_3.26.wav_ASR	and she forgot about her uh her shoe the last shoe
UCL02a_2312.503_0.93.wav_ASR	okay but now that's all
UCL02a_2315.122_5.4.wav_ASR	signal r signal uh that's um um by myself because she was
UCL02a_2320.537_2.92.wav_ASR	it's like a sort of um um magnetic
UCL02a_2323.479_3.38.wav_ASR	it has to back to her how all places are well
UCL02a_2328.309_13.82.wav_ASR	um anyway the print remember that the p the print is the black thing is the black thing is the black thing is well

whiteside15a_1541.291_6.1.wav_ASR	you go to the um red
whiteside15a_1547.767_6.02.wav_ASR	and you can have two slides of reds
whiteside15a_1554.88_13.83.wav_ASR	and um pen yeah but it's less than that
whiteside15a_1573.789_0.56.wav_ASR	oh yeah
whiteside15a_1575.736_3.45.wav_ASR	slathered up the red

whiteside15a_1654.555_1.91.wav_ASR	and then you eat it up
williamson08a_2.291_0.43.wav_ASR	okay
williamson08a_11.874_5.03.wav_ASR	um it's definitely getting better
williamson08a_17.679_4.89.wav_ASR	but um i still have a long way to go
williamson08a_24.352_9.16.wav_ASR	um so um i my biggest option is reading
williamson08a_34.213_4.5.wav_ASR	um i i can't read like at all
williamson08a_39.832_7.46.wav_ASR	um and so um my apparatus is helping me
williamson08a_47.822_15.12.wav_ASR	um so um i do um i do like it's like a g uh it's um
williamson08a_67.45_4.92.wav_ASR	so it's two different things together
williamson08a_72.823_10.58.wav_ASR	um and but it's basically you re um a hundred words
williamson08a_84.098_6.36.wav_ASR	um and you press every two times a day
williamson08a_122.784_0.46.wav_ASR	so yeah
williamson08a_123.785_2.69.wav_ASR	so i appreciate it
williamson08a_126.606_2.34.wav_ASR	and i mean i'm getting better
williamson08a_128.995_7.06.wav_ASR	but um i uh for me like i would love to read
williamson08a_137.197_6.33.wav_ASR	um but i just it's like a disk connected you know
williamson08a_143.796_1.68.wav_ASR	and i really don't know
williamson08a_145.543_4.64.wav_ASR	uh i mean i think originally i'll be able to see but i just really have no idea
williamson08a_153.572_0.4.wav_ASR	yeah
williamson08a_154.023_0.44.wav_ASR	oh yeah
williamson08a_154.485_0.76.wav_ASR	absolutely
williamson08a_164.932_4.03.wav_ASR	well actually well i guess it should tell you that i was asleep
williamson08a_169.993_4.85.wav_ASR	um and i had a c. eraser
williamson08a_175.536_5.26.wav_ASR	um and cris like i mean i was a step curve is also
williamson08a_181.83_0.7.wav_ASR	my husband
williamson08a_182.832_5.85.wav_ASR	yeah um and so i actually don't remember a lot
williamson08a_189.529_22.52.wav_ASR	um so um i guess but i i mean i've eventually cr um um i listened um i'm just said like
williamson08a_212.441_1.02.wav_ASR	it's a black cat
williamson08a_217.274_2.44.wav_ASR	yeah yeah yeah yeah

williamson08a_226.071_8.22.wav_ASR	um and um i had a cranium
williamson08a_234.866_15.93.wav_ASR	um and i basically had um my basically had um the bleeding thing of um
williamson08a_251.701_0.4.wav_ASR	yeah
williamson08a_252.148_5.94.wav_ASR	so like i had to take my scale off you know
williamson08a_258.197_1.361.wav_ASR	so now i have this
williamson08a_261.035_1.25.wav_ASR	so you can always remember
williamson08a_263.341_9.84.wav_ASR	um and then i just um it was like mm i would say like six months
williamson08a_285.614_1.86.wav_ASR	oh let's see that's the problem

williamson08a_552.509_0.46.wav_ASR	okay
williamson08a_554.463_12.74.wav_ASR	so um the boy was um the cocking a sock
williamson08a_568.149_27.39.wav_ASR	um and he killed it really hard and um actually he killed it really hard and um that
williamson08a_595.614_22.45.wav_ASR	and um uh and it um the window the window window
williamson08a_620.013_13.28.wav_ASR	um and the man the man was watching t. v.
williamson08a_633.344_10.06.wav_ASR	and he had um the um uh
williamson08a_654.341_25.06.wav_ASR	um and uh he or and so the man stand up and and just try to see um where the um what type of um purpose it is
williamson08a_683.603_1.01.wav_ASR	oh no idea

williamson08a_737.298_0.71.wav_ASR	be fine
williamson08a_738.145_0.82.wav_ASR	oh worry about
williamson08a_740.922_5.04.wav_ASR	and so um so he went to school
williamson08a_746.152_4.09.wav_ASR	and then all of a sudden it started raining
williamson08a_751.94_6.44.wav_ASR	and and it just kept rating
williamson08a_758.839_5.98.wav_ASR	and then actually went um sides ways
williamson08a_765.72_17.3.wav_ASR	and so um so when he um so when he um went back and said to the woman
williamson08a_818.127_5.96.wav_ASR	and so he or so she got an opener
williamson08a_824.134_4.29.wav_ASR	and then she or he went um to school
williamson08a_847.304_0.8.wav_ASR	alright
williamson08a_852.296_0.68.wav_ASR	okay
williamson08a_899.29_2.43.wav_ASR	alrightly now a th oh
williamson08a_904.765_0.37.wav_ASR	oh yeah
williamson08a_964.493_8.82.wav_ASR	um and so the the man went a ladder
williamson08a_973.877_14.84.wav_ASR	um and he went um up to the three and try to get the kitty cat
williamson08a_989.586_8.82.wav_ASR	and um but the the the the later actually felt
williamson08a_999.561_14.17.wav_ASR	um and so he um got the fireman's remote
williamson08a_1013.782_16.43.wav_ASR	and um he's trying to um so that the he's just being rejected
williamson08a_1039.594_0.669.wav_ASR	oh
williamson08a_1176.902_0.54.wav_ASR	oh great
williamson08a_1178.21_0.43.wav_ASR	okay
williamson08a_1178.759_1.91.wav_ASR	so um
williamson08a_1184.163_0.64.wav_ASR	oh
williamson08a_1185.0_0.39.wav_ASR	oh okay
williamson08a_1186.121_0.68.wav_ASR	what's that
williamson08a_1189.008_1.73.wav_ASR	the sender i think
williamson08a_1192.008_0.54.wav_ASR	or uh
williamson08a_1194.661_0.35.wav_ASR	now uh
williamson08a_1195.557_7.74.wav_ASR	so a standard um um
williamson08a_1207.698_20.13.wav_ASR	so um
williamson08a_1229.492_2.46.wav_ASR	so um
williamson08a_1236.903_0.65.wav_ASR	yeah
williamson08a_1242.727_13.09.wav_ASR	um so
williamson08a_1255.896_0.46.wav_ASR	oh
williamson08a_1258.193_0.59.wav_ASR	okay
williamson08a_1260.878_18.78.wav_ASR	um uh s so uh 'cause there were um those were for um they were for um colours
williamson08a_1280.679_0.38.wav_ASR	yeah
williamson08a_1281.459_9.91.wav_ASR	um so there were three colours that were very proper
williamson08a_1291.751_6.82.wav_ASR	and then the um signal uh was like a slide basically
williamson08a_1299.967_20.73.wav_ASR	and um so she um did all the roars and you know um just everything
williamson08a_1359.082_27.2.wav_ASR	and it said that um they are going to have a b al and um because um the price needs a base
williamson08a_1386.937_6.48.wav_ASR	and so um they got all dressed up
williamson08a_1393.777_18.64.wav_ASR	and um but the sender uh um um she's um um she's apparently didn't
williamson08a_1412.533_7.72.wav_ASR	um so uh she got dressed
williamson08a_1420.383_17.36.wav_ASR	um but then the three guns just um um they got in a fight
williamson08a_1438.34_5.82.wav_ASR	and the rest just turn up and pieces
williamson08a_1444.95_7.12.wav_ASR	and so um so she she wasn't able to go
williamson08a_1453.146_21.33.wav_ASR	um and then um and so she um and then the uh um and then the b um and just thought about the ball
williamson08a_1474.529_8.39.wav_ASR	and then um the favourites or whatever they were um they came

williamson08a_1547.21_5.72.wav_ASR	and um they lived happily ever after
williamson08a_1553.904_1.54.wav_ASR	that means it's not really that
williamson08a_1567.959_0.45.wav_ASR	oh
williamson08a_1569.928_15.76.wav_ASR	well first um i'd um so i'd get the plate
williamson08a_1586.371_10.26.wav_ASR	um and then i um get two p. p. s of red
williamson08a_1597.369_9.14.wav_ASR	um and um i go to the cover
williamson08a_1606.558_3.99.wav_ASR	and i get um pen up button
williamson08a_1611.322_6.72.wav_ASR	and then i go to the regulator and get the the the radio
williamson08a_1618.85_10.58.wav_ASR	um and then i um and i um get uh nine
williamson08a_1630.015_20.47.wav_ASR	and um i um and then i um the pen up um the pen but
williamson08a_1651.195_5.09.wav_ASR	and then i spread the the g.
williamson08a_1656.976_4.3.wav_ASR	um and then
williamson14a_8.415_0.35.wav_ASR	okay
williamson14a_17.0_1.66.wav_ASR	it's poor in no
williamson14a_19.406_23.14.wav_ASR	and uh and um uh and um it's not good
williamson14a_47.141_0.44.wav_ASR	oh yeah
williamson14a_50.499_3.33.wav_ASR	it was five years and it did in fact today
williamson14a_54.282_1.13.wav_ASR	mean uh i mean
williamson14a_55.692_11.33.wav_ASR	but around uh i think it was um aged three
williamson14a_69.808_0.39.wav_ASR	let me see
williamson14a_73.073_2.48.wav_ASR	that was uh i was clearly as a bell
williamson14a_75.598_6.73.wav_ASR	and i mean uh oh eight p. m. and i had a stroke
williamson14a_89.496_1.35.wav_ASR	and he s he said uh
williamson14a_91.787_2.95.wav_ASR	it there was uh your question
williamson14a_95.262_1.71.wav_ASR	it d it didn't know the questions
williamson14a_97.594_1.51.wav_ASR	so colour amplifiers
williamson14a_100.388_0.75.wav_ASR	so i did it
williamson14a_102.303_1.31.wav_ASR	and then uh then you are
williamson14a_103.806_10.26.wav_ASR	and it's uh it's uh three a three months
williamson14a_114.969_2.65.wav_ASR	and i got out
williamson14a_123.252_0.63.wav_ASR	yeah a half
williamson14a_135.653_7.7.wav_ASR	well um i used to go pensteady
williamson14a_145.153_0.86.wav_ASR	and it was really helpful
williamson14a_146.347_1.23.wav_ASR	and it was really helpful
williamson14a_148.75_4.51.wav_ASR	uh uh four cells
williamson14a_155.333_0.93.wav_ASR	or specialists
williamson14a_157.039_1.11.wav_ASR	and it was really helpful
williamson14a_158.829_3.49.wav_ASR	the people were absolutely aesthetic
williamson14a_163.424_1.23.wav_ASR	you know that was really helpful
williamson14a_164.674_2.29.wav_ASR	and i mean and i g i can't say a word of it
williamson14a_169.8_2.46.wav_ASR	but uh but i'm here i'm here
williamson14a_175.392_3.42.wav_ASR	think uh probabri probability but i don't know yeah
williamson14a_187.061_0.47.wav_ASR	oh yeah
williamson14a_187.654_0.57.wav_ASR	uh definitely
williamson14a_215.51_4.9.wav_ASR	well uh he died my life
williamson14a_221.366_0.34.wav_ASR	design
williamson14a_223.991_10.29.wav_ASR	uh it wants um twelve
williamson14a_234.303_0.65.wav_ASR	yeah
williamson14a_238.281_0.38.wav_ASR	okay
williamson14a_239.36_1.679.wav_ASR	oh okay
williamson14a_243.047_1.059.wav_ASR	oh but i'm saying uh
williamson14a_244.966_7.14.wav_ASR	uh yeah it was uh twenty three euros
williamson14a_253.148_0.94.wav_ASR	long time no
williamson14a_257.214_3.861.wav_ASR	and the c the the the stars was uh helpful
williamson14a_261.093_4.32.wav_ASR	and i mean it was in my m uh it was uh really helpful
williamson14a_265.83_7.31.wav_ASR	um and uh i did it for uh the graphical skills and things like that
williamson14a_274.264_7.59.wav_ASR	and it was uh smith college and uh university of
williamson14a_285.638_6.35.wav_ASR	and it was a masters and uh a p. h. d.
williamson14a_296.698_0.35.wav_ASR	oh yeah
williamson14a_302.232_8.29.wav_ASR	it was uh twenty three euros
williamson14a_311.969_1.63.wav_ASR	yeah
williamson14a_317.862_4.44.wav_ASR	um about four and a half
williamson14a_355.36_3.882.wav_ASR	well the the boy is uh the fruit uh the shark
williamson14a_360.581_6.48.wav_ASR	and he um and the um the window shattered
williamson14a_369.146_9.71.wav_ASR	and uh the man s and the w uh and the man in the the the black door charger
williamson14a_380.501_3.54.wav_ASR	and he is portable about it
williamson14a_386.018_0.87.wav_ASR	well i think so
williamson14a_414.001_2.31.wav_ASR	yeah i i th i think so
williamson14a_416.507_6.15.wav_ASR	um my f my uh my my mother you know and a little boy
williamson14a_424.062_1.55.wav_ASR	my father is well
williamson14a_425.874_0.34.wav_ASR	yeah
williamson14a_427.244_3.99.wav_ASR	but uh i i think it was uh a m a and uh it's a kid
williamson14a_432.276_2.97.wav_ASR	and uh and stop the painting you know
williamson14a_436.397_1.07.wav_ASR	and uh but he says
williamson14a_437.9_1.28.wav_ASR	um i'm not gonna do it
williamson14a_440.145_0.79.wav_ASR	we yes she will
williamson14a_442.395_5.95.wav_ASR	and soon uh um the range starts
williamson14a_449.756_0.97.wav_ASR	and in pouring
williamson14a_452.256_9.46.wav_ASR	and the mother and the the the the the the the the the is um it's turn
williamson14a_463.514_3.29.wav_ASR	and uh and he he brings a remote
williamson14a_472.382_0.77.wav_ASR	now i don't
williamson14a_474.487_0.85.wav_ASR	let's see them on
williamson14a_484.722_0.58.wav_ASR	my dog
williamson14a_487.55_3.3.wav_ASR	okay um the man is sitting down
williamson14a_490.929_1.05.wav_ASR	and uh he's scared
williamson14a_493.556_7.07.wav_ASR	and um and uh the the dog is jumping up
williamson14a_501.572_2.18.wav_ASR	and uh the f the favourite said
williamson14a_504.56_0.81.wav_ASR	the bring a ladder
williamson14a_507.35_9.55.wav_ASR	and the and the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the
williamson14a_518.123_9.34.wav_ASR	and he's p p apparently uh the the filename uh the cat and the and the name and the and the dog
williamson14a_541.068_0.53.wav_ASR	should do
williamson14a_544.814_0.57.wav_ASR	oh my
williamson14a_552.744_0.33.wav_ASR	alright
williamson14a_682.364_0.36.wav_ASR	okay
williamson14a_684.551_15.84.wav_ASR	well um a sender colour and my step down and uh and his uh sammy w why um and together
williamson14a_701.721_9.68.wav_ASR	and um and uh the step down uh is not very good
williamson14a_711.455_3.89.wav_ASR	and i mean she's c do the work you know
williamson14a_717.047_0.75.wav_ASR	so um
williamson14a_719.298_9.14.wav_ASR	but the summary s so summary dollars uh p the price fair
williamson14a_729.98_7.59.wav_ASR	uh and um so um there was a ball
williamson14a_739.041_5.53.wav_ASR	and he invited the step doors and the central
williamson14a_746.474_13.9.wav_ASR	and um the f the um the folder step
williamson14a_761.972_6.79.wav_ASR	now uh better to be uh two w two uh dollars
williamson14a_769.572_2.46.wav_ASR	and stay at home in uh the scenario
williamson14a_773.477_0.34.wav_ASR	so
williamson14a_775.776_4.51.wav_ASR	but the f the the fuzzy god or
williamson14a_783.095_1.11.wav_ASR	and he said uh
williamson14a_787.24_0.64.wav_ASR	matrix
williamson14a_788.42_6.68.wav_ASR	and um and uh the magic
williamson14a_795.857_3.01.wav_ASR	and he uh f the fuzzy dads
williamson14a_799.054_4.76.wav_ASR	and you mean and he uh a beautiful uh process
williamson14a_805.151_1.99.wav_ASR	um and to the board
williamson14a_809.086_5.0.wav_ASR	so uh and the the principles said uh you struck an
williamson14a_814.598_7.96.wav_ASR	and he said uh uh he the the dancing took place
williamson14a_822.656_9.42.wav_ASR	and uh and uh and he said um the principles is
williamson14a_834.373_0.49.wav_ASR	love you
williamson14a_835.931_7.57.wav_ASR	but the the s the s the um twelve and a half
williamson14a_844.53_8.25.wav_ASR	and he the the the the the
williamson14a_853.46_1.38.wav_ASR	oh
williamson14a_857.068_3.71.wav_ASR	um and he run r run away
williamson14a_862.067_4.68.wav_ASR	and he's in the sh the the the the the the the the the the the the the r. s uh stuff and stuff like that
williamson14a_868.396_4.57.wav_ASR	but the uh but the p the principles was uh there
williamson14a_873.563_2.15.wav_ASR	and he uh in searched and searched
williamson14a_876.305_1.65.wav_ASR	and he s the splinters
williamson14a_879.55_10.91.wav_ASR	and he um and he the step folder the step folder says
williamson14a_890.718_1.91.wav_ASR	now that was too heavy
williamson14a_893.155_7.16.wav_ASR	but the g. r. l. was uh just one i mean just uh the libraries
williamson14a_901.097_1.4.wav_ASR	and you one
williamson14a_902.685_1.44.wav_ASR	so he married
williamson14a_904.669_2.65.wav_ASR	in a uh happy uh oh
williamson14a_909.93_2.86.wav_ASR	oh no but um uh yes uh but the body
williamson14a_917.394_0.59.wav_ASR	oh okay
williamson14a_918.341_0.64.wav_ASR	you really
williamson14a_921.09_0.519.wav_ASR	great
williamson14a_924.728_0.74.wav_ASR	oh okay
williamson14a_941.912_0.44.wav_ASR	so
williamson14a_946.562_10.18.wav_ASR	uh well uh red two bridges two descriptions
williamson14a_957.688_6.28.wav_ASR	and uh and um the arrow and a p. m. button
williamson14a_965.673_4.69.wav_ASR	and he spread it a night a spread a r a night
williamson14a_971.743_4.44.wav_ASR	and um and uh there you are
williamson14a_976.204_1.66.wav_ASR	oh a sandwich
williamson14a_981.548_1.01.wav_ASR	kid not too bad
williamson14b_10.082_0.87.wav_ASR	oh very good
williamson14b_11.338_1.95.wav_ASR	um not bad but good
williamson14b_17.271_0.59.wav_ASR	yes i did
williamson14b_19.939_0.67.wav_ASR	yes i did
williamson14b_21.942_0.45.wav_ASR	uh-huh
williamson14b_22.964_5.92.wav_ASR	it was two thousand five
williamson14b_33.931_0.34.wav_ASR	oh yeah
williamson14b_34.826_0.62.wav_ASR	yeah
williamson14b_37.148_8.77.wav_ASR	well uh uh it was uh four a. m.
williamson14b_46.762_0.88.wav_ASR	and i had a stroke
williamson14b_55.66_4.59.wav_ASR	and uh i i w oh i was conscious you know
williamson14b_61.054_1.43.wav_ASR	and uh the amplitude
williamson14b_63.372_5.97.wav_ASR	and uh any uh any um
williamson14b_70.972_5.8.wav_ASR	paradox you r rush to the the uh the calculator
williamson14b_77.79_5.01.wav_ASR	and arrows i mean um another one
williamson14b_84.323_4.17.wav_ASR	arithmetic arithmetic oh was there
williamson14b_89.267_0.85.wav_ASR	in um
williamson14b_94.697_13.51.wav_ASR	and there was uh and any trans now uh uh an a month to uh the amplitude adjustment again in uh uh mount button household as well
williamson14b_109.533_0.61.wav_ASR	at all
williamson14b_115.291_0.49.wav_ASR	yeah
williamson14b_125.074_4.61.wav_ASR	well uh th uh that uh household uh um
williamson14b_133.148_3.6.wav_ASR	uh i i i was standing
williamson14b_137.17_10.9.wav_ASR	and um and uh and my uh my dad uh was um there
williamson14b_149.375_9.03.wav_ASR	and uh it was three years and uh uh the drawing he was very good uh a test you know
williamson14b_159.171_1.17.wav_ASR	it is a process
williamson14b_160.539_1.64.wav_ASR	the pen the ans but
williamson14b_163.793_0.45.wav_ASR	yes
williamson14b_166.018_1.22.wav_ASR	but now i did it you know
williamson14b_168.229_1.4.wav_ASR	it was oh oh is uh
williamson14b_171.399_3.63.wav_ASR	and then um a hurry
williamson14b_175.879_1.31.wav_ASR	yeah i got a r. yeah
williamson14b_178.096_1.13.wav_ASR	but he always died
williamson14b_181.265_5.76.wav_ASR	now but the leg it's it was n uh it was worse
williamson14b_187.576_0.69.wav_ASR	it was worse
williamson14b_189.462_4.449.wav_ASR	actually uh i mean it's two years ago
williamson14b_194.226_1.71.wav_ASR	and then you f gradually it's better
williamson14b_199.03_0.41.wav_ASR	yeah
williamson14b_209.557_2.5.wav_ASR	well not really i mean uh it here
williamson14b_212.545_0.45.wav_ASR	or sh yeah
williamson14b_214.958_5.93.wav_ASR	yes well not real but um i used to be uh in pen state
williamson14b_221.477_2.1.wav_ASR	there was a uh uh organisation
williamson14b_225.18_1.22.wav_ASR	it's it's a scale
williamson14b_226.85_0.72.wav_ASR	and I would prefer
williamson14b_227.813_1.21.wav_ASR	it was really restrictive
williamson14b_229.946_1.14.wav_ASR	it was really something
williamson14b_232.539_4.17.wav_ASR	but i stayed uh two years ago
williamson14b_237.274_2.62.wav_ASR	and then and then the centre
williamson14b_243.689_0.54.wav_ASR	yeah it is
williamson14b_244.393_0.43.wav_ASR	yeah that
williamson14b_264.492_6.88.wav_ASR	well the well boy uh uh the the boy who was kicking the the
williamson14b_272.629_8.16.wav_ASR	and he and um and the window was button over
williamson14b_282.184_6.87.wav_ASR	and uh and the and the the button or the the the man
williamson14b_293.137_5.11.wav_ASR	and uh um break the window
williamson14b_299.025_0.81.wav_ASR	and the ball
williamson14b_301.44_6.12.wav_ASR	and uh was uh it was broken
williamson14b_338.753_0.38.wav_ASR	okay
williamson14b_341.736_8.15.wav_ASR	um the uh the uh the the and the um the boy
williamson14b_350.997_10.55.wav_ASR	uh he is uh he was uh he was um he didn't want to go
williamson14b_362.719_1.3.wav_ASR	so he said
williamson14b_364.141_0.45.wav_ASR	now
williamson14b_366.146_0.57.wav_ASR	it's okay
williamson14b_368.248_2.69.wav_ASR	but uh it was poring
williamson14b_372.461_2.6.wav_ASR	and it was w absolutely boring
williamson14b_376.316_9.12.wav_ASR	and uh and the and the uh the mother and the uh the brother and the uh child was mad
williamson14b_386.363_3.22.wav_ASR	now he's uh the amber
williamson14b_425.681_5.43.wav_ASR	well the goal was uh on the three with a cat
williamson14b_432.745_11.37.wav_ASR	so uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh the uh on the three
williamson14b_445.209_4.06.wav_ASR	but the dog who's yelping
williamson14b_450.994_7.45.wav_ASR	so so we uh took out the fire and rejected 'em
williamson14b_468.993_0.4.wav_ASR	yes
williamson14b_472.298_0.41.wav_ASR	so
williamson14b_615.236_0.5.wav_ASR	okay
williamson14b_616.869_17.51.wav_ASR	uh the step uh m uh and uh the sumali beautiful uh uh two uh dollars and uh his w his wife
williamson14b_636.075_2.8.wav_ASR	and he uh arranged the the the managed
williamson14b_640.322_10.39.wav_ASR	but the the step down is really not didn't uh it was uh g yes because the two curves because of the two curves
williamson14b_652.237_17.68.wav_ASR	so uh he's looking in cleaning and um uh but the the the the the the the the the the yeah the summary useful why i mean uh the the the the
williamson14b_670.99_4.72.wav_ASR	so um so uh he um there was a ball
williamson14b_676.799_3.41.wav_ASR	uh and uh the white was stayed at home
williamson14b_681.131_8.97.wav_ASR	and the sammy's beautiful uh oh uh it does uh is uh in the ball
williamson14b_692.195_7.59.wav_ASR	and um but the fiery uh the fiery god my said uh uh uh uh uh
williamson14b_701.684_0.96.wav_ASR	and the penguin
williamson14b_703.542_0.86.wav_ASR	and uh let's
williamson14b_704.519_3.35.wav_ASR	you're going to the this the the you're b
williamson14b_709.28_3.02.wav_ASR	so we uh dress our up
williamson14b_713.72_1.57.wav_ASR	and uh it was a beautiful place
williamson14b_716.572_2.52.wav_ASR	and he uh stepped uh the demanding
williamson14b_720.042_3.19.wav_ASR	and uh the process step uh there
williamson14b_724.086_1.33.wav_ASR	and a two here it is
williamson14b_726.718_21.63.wav_ASR	so um but now uh the the the the the the the the the the the the
williamson14b_748.729_7.69.wav_ASR	but uh the uh and he changed it to the white horse to i uh the mouse
williamson14b_757.621_9.63.wav_ASR	and the uh is uh in the um and and and and and the show
williamson14b_769.62_5.48.wav_ASR	so he uh but he was concerned about uh the white
williamson14b_775.983_3.85.wav_ASR	and uh and the uh uh the um the m. d. r.
williamson14b_781.32_1.35.wav_ASR	so he said
williamson14b_783.562_0.73.wav_ASR	that was a shoe
williamson14b_786.17_1.28.wav_ASR	oh where is this shoe
williamson14b_789.337_12.67.wav_ASR	so i think there was the um uh the uh the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the
williamson14b_802.032_4.61.wav_ASR	oh no what the hell it is but
williamson14b_807.41_1.07.wav_ASR	and he goes around
williamson14b_808.55_4.17.wav_ASR	um and e in the one uh uh the slider
williamson14b_814.419_0.66.wav_ASR	so we found
williamson14b_815.879_0.86.wav_ASR	and that's the end of it
williamson14b_829.716_5.57.wav_ASR	well mm there's a two piece of red
williamson14b_837.105_2.76.wav_ASR	open the uh the cell phone
williamson14b_841.519_2.78.wav_ASR	and uh two pieces of red
williamson14b_847.059_12.67.wav_ASR	um and uh the one the red and the other the bottom was the red
williamson14b_860.221_4.83.wav_ASR	and the uh the digits i mean the the plate was there
williamson14b_867.227_10.49.wav_ASR	so he um the pineapple and yellow yeah the p. r. uh is um the jar
williamson14b_879.138_1.62.wav_ASR	and the uh the hand
williamson14b_881.397_6.09.wav_ASR	and the p uh in the p. n. battery uh and yellow and uh
williamson14b_887.509_0.62.wav_ASR	ah shou
williamson14b_888.286_21.9.wav_ASR	the um the um the um the um the um
williamson14b_910.888_10.49.wav_ASR	and the and the class for scrolling back
williamson14b_921.962_6.41.wav_ASR	and and um the pen is there
williamson14b_930.798_2.17.wav_ASR	and uh uh and a night
williamson14b_934.477_2.21.wav_ASR	and you uh spread it around
williamson14b_938.003_3.4.wav_ASR	and uh make a some uh pani bar
williamson14b_943.261_0.32.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_21.326_0.39.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_33.919_2.51.wav_ASR	oh it it it comes and goes
wright204a_36.502_8.6.wav_ASR	by that i mean uh normally i can i can get things but then there are times when i can't get the words out
wright204a_46.058_5.75.wav_ASR	so then i have to either try them or write them or s
wright204a_52.361_3.35.wav_ASR	half the time i d i d i get it and sometimes i do
wright204a_70.687_0.41.wav_ASR	yes
wright204a_72.596_8.66.wav_ASR	it was uh number the fifth nine eight a. a. a. a. a. a. a.
wright204a_83.112_2.56.wav_ASR	it was right after uh a balloon is a lot
wright204a_87.358_3.86.wav_ASR	and uh i actually digitised it
wright204a_91.931_2.52.wav_ASR	decided that it was c something was wrong with me
wright204a_94.5_1.48.wav_ASR	it was about five and a half
wright204a_96.693_17.35.wav_ASR	and uh i uh d actually said before i said anything to my wife i want to um computer to
wright204a_116.296_6.93.wav_ASR	uh it was the was uh that's double you
wright204a_125.236_1.64.wav_ASR	the doctors thing you know
wright204a_127.587_1.32.wav_ASR	yeah i got a scroll
wright204a_129.639_0.521.wav_ASR	yeah
wright204a_131.354_1.07.wav_ASR	think i have a stroke
wright204a_132.539_1.42.wav_ASR	then i want in and told my wife
wright204a_135.675_8.74.wav_ASR	he was really because my brother in law had one noticed that i had a little bit of swallow and uh yeah
wright204a_144.878_3.05.wav_ASR	so she immediately called the parameters
wright204a_148.982_0.93.wav_ASR	yeah
wright204a_150.235_2.4.wav_ASR	well they're doing in that i gotta get rid of
wright204a_153.306_1.62.wav_ASR	had my shortcomings
wright204a_154.992_4.06.wav_ASR	had to put a pear of hands on to go to the sh
wright204a_161.391_1.24.wav_ASR	yeah so i did
wright204a_163.103_1.76.wav_ASR	uh the batteries came up
wright204a_165.426_1.7.wav_ASR	ah and i said
wright204a_168.011_1.22.wav_ASR	think i'm having a stroke
wright204a_169.941_1.47.wav_ASR	and they looked at me
wright204a_171.523_2.04.wav_ASR	and then i looked at me again
wright204a_173.581_0.4.wav_ASR	uh let's see
wright204a_174.146_0.86.wav_ASR	it think you're right
wright204a_176.302_1.03.wav_ASR	so we made
wright204a_177.886_0.79.wav_ASR	everything was fine
wright204a_178.771_1.52.wav_ASR	uh still a week
wright204a_180.306_1.01.wav_ASR	everything was great
wright204a_182.077_6.1.wav_ASR	and that's after go going on in the uh amplitude i sort of don't remember
wright204a_193.108_0.34.wav_ASR	well
wright204a_196.357_2.49.wav_ASR	well this is a stroke that's a bleeding stroke
wright204a_200.509_1.51.wav_ASR	that was that was the design
wright204a_202.822_0.7.wav_ASR	yes
wright204a_204.132_3.8.wav_ASR	which i understand is little bit less than half
wright204a_208.966_0.67.wav_ASR	that was me
wright204a_210.501_0.9.wav_ASR	it's one of the latest
wright204a_212.664_5.3.wav_ASR	and uh i uh i was in three different hotels
wright204a_218.922_5.15.wav_ASR	and uh really didn't come out of anything until about
wright204a_225.73_0.45.wav_ASR	let's see
wright204a_227.123_9.64.wav_ASR	it would say the middle of december just before christmas already for the first time
wright204a_238.834_1.62.wav_ASR	it was out for a lot of time
wright204a_240.614_4.38.wav_ASR	you had all kinds of telets and oh
wright204a_247.286_2.71.wav_ASR	uh two and a half uh the r. and r.
wright204a_250.143_1.63.wav_ASR	oh
wright204a_252.388_1.03.wav_ASR	think that's what they call
wright204a_255.308_1.49.wav_ASR	shame that put it in
wright204a_258.047_5.38.wav_ASR	ah and uh from now on then i was at borders
wright204a_263.563_11.04.wav_ASR	uh i remember all the arrows where i had all three uh uh things for oh speech uh
wright204a_285.874_1.82.wav_ASR	well i'm i'm a lot longer too
wright204a_288.289_6.62.wav_ASR	ah yeah i uh had to learn to use more of my left hand than i wanted to
wright204a_295.072_5.09.wav_ASR	oh but i can't i was parallelised on the whole right side
wright204a_301.173_1.18.wav_ASR	for for a longer time
wright204a_303.069_4.89.wav_ASR	oh when i got out of the household for the third time i was in a wheel chair
wright204a_315.318_2.19.wav_ASR	now they're all all for one to the
wright204a_318.564_0.31.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_319.489_15.42.wav_ASR	so uh really from uh the summary of o. eight through about the end of october november december um the guarantee of all nine
wright204a_337.032_3.05.wav_ASR	so 'cause we had different problems
wright204a_340.132_1.81.wav_ASR	uh i had sheet data
wright204a_343.379_4.39.wav_ASR	ah had uh some other kind of things that i w i don't even remember
wright204a_348.779_3.78.wav_ASR	and so it it took a long time just to get out of the household
wright204a_353.142_6.05.wav_ASR	but i was home uh in a cellar to just a summary anyway
wright204a_360.553_13.81.wav_ASR	rubber in the future for oh i started oh cherry channel original holiday over in china
wright204a_375.474_6.3.wav_ASR	the oh i then in there is a roo in the end of the uh the ear
wright204a_391.134_0.65.wav_ASR	that's correct
wright204a_400.899_0.38.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_423.934_1.43.wav_ASR	yes
wright204a_426.385_3.17.wav_ASR	ah th i had a bit of a like good luck
wright204a_430.939_2.71.wav_ASR	ah i'm not sure if it's a good idea
wright204a_434.419_0.39.wav_ASR	here he is
wright204a_435.869_1.32.wav_ASR	oh it's a giraffe
wright204a_437.931_2.89.wav_ASR	ah my first child was a big event
wright204a_441.696_4.35.wav_ASR	oh my second third and fourth channels
wright204a_448.445_4.81.wav_ASR	we just had our fifty hundred oh this fast uh
wright204a_454.55_4.98.wav_ASR	well it'll be a year in you in one
wright204a_460.255_1.8.wav_ASR	will be our first fifty per hour
wright204a_462.698_3.202.wav_ASR	oh there's lots of things
wright204a_466.905_2.09.wav_ASR	uh yeah had a good life is a child
wright204a_469.055_1.22.wav_ASR	it was an only child
wright204a_471.226_6.03.wav_ASR	oh i don't know what to say
wright204a_488.482_2.61.wav_ASR	oh
wright204a_551.677_4.2.wav_ASR	little boy is playing with a circle ball i guess
wright204a_556.512_3.27.wav_ASR	and he happens to hit the window
wright204a_562.435_1.63.wav_ASR	and it goes in
wright204a_564.087_8.98.wav_ASR	it had to it uh the guy inside is is in the p in the in the picture is sitting down
wright204a_573.142_3.66.wav_ASR	and it hits on my guess or at least it comes in the window
wright204a_577.402_1.19.wav_ASR	so we've got classics
wright204a_579.694_1.82.wav_ASR	and uh i go
wright204a_581.882_2.06.wav_ASR	he looks at the window
wright204a_583.994_0.79.wav_ASR	there is the wall
wright204a_584.804_8.2.wav_ASR	uh apparently he's going out to see what happened and maybe let the ball uh go back to the toddler child
wright204a_611.342_0.53.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_612.361_1.49.wav_ASR	looks like it's ready for school
wright204a_614.634_3.67.wav_ASR	he's says looks like he might want it to take the animal
wright204a_619.559_2.09.wav_ASR	he's 'cause he's just said okay
wright204a_623.716_0.88.wav_ASR	did she say
wright204a_625.692_0.59.wav_ASR	maybe not
wright204a_626.402_0.35.wav_ASR	don't know
wright204a_626.8_2.35.wav_ASR	because now he's going to school
wright204a_629.803_0.94.wav_ASR	oh no it isn't
wright204a_630.763_0.47.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_633.482_1.14.wav_ASR	it's it's
wright204a_634.899_1.17.wav_ASR	oh i don't think i need it
wright204a_637.004_1.53.wav_ASR	ah
wright204a_639.482_1.63.wav_ASR	and he must be waiting for the bus
wright204a_641.129_1.2.wav_ASR	and it's lighting in the room
wright204a_642.924_2.12.wav_ASR	so now it's coming down pretty good
wright204a_645.498_1.72.wav_ASR	so he's goes back to the house
wright204a_647.796_0.36.wav_ASR	let me see
wright204a_648.654_0.66.wav_ASR	oh well it's
wright204a_650.019_0.33.wav_ASR	and this
wright204a_651.289_1.3.wav_ASR	maybe i'd better go the bob
wright204a_672.485_0.54.wav_ASR	let's see
wright204a_677.959_4.91.wav_ASR	looks like the problem is the cat is stuck up in a tree
wright204a_683.65_0.4.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_685.27_2.21.wav_ASR	ah that on the on the
wright204a_687.552_3.18.wav_ASR	oh he's kind of stuck himself i think
wright204a_691.424_2.46.wav_ASR	oh the little girl is crying for the cat
wright204a_694.509_1.57.wav_ASR	ah it's got a number
wright204a_696.668_4.34.wav_ASR	there's a there's a guy up on the t oh a dog walking up the tree
wright204a_701.845_1.46.wav_ASR	the private department is coming
wright204a_703.403_5.75.wav_ASR	the little girl was trying to was w was trying to reach it i guess
wright204a_709.619_2.69.wav_ASR	don't know if she was trying to get this letter or not
wright204a_712.623_1.35.wav_ASR	it's no idea about that
wright204a_715.021_2.4.wav_ASR	oh the screen
wright204a_717.541_1.03.wav_ASR	by a track is there
wright204a_718.865_6.08.wav_ASR	and they're coming up with a later apparently to help get the cat and better not
wright204a_729.715_0.44.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_730.298_1.47.wav_ASR	oh that's that's a real picture
wright204a_733.872_5.81.wav_ASR	this is a yeah this is a yeah probably a flattened stream
wright204a_740.511_1.38.wav_ASR	probably right here an hour later
wright204a_744.599_3.77.wav_ASR	uh the curve is apparently worth down the rubber
wright204a_749.301_2.17.wav_ASR	and uh this is her colleague
wright204a_752.238_8.31.wav_ASR	and uh she is handing on to a brand that they're trying to get him get him to a state
wright204a_764.718_0.38.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_772.353_0.32.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_776.476_0.63.wav_ASR	yes i do
wright204a_903.564_5.15.wav_ASR	oh um she was
wright204a_911.851_7.38.wav_ASR	the the the story w well the two dollars and the qu what i call the c the real
wright204a_920.645_13.21.wav_ASR	and oh uh oh she was i th i couldn't remember even from looking at that uh what the resistance is to the the good curve uh silicone
wright204a_935.994_4.63.wav_ASR	uh i know that she was like a squirrel
wright204a_941.361_9.2.wav_ASR	and had all to uh to uh was they were really oh putting her down
wright204a_950.842_7.62.wav_ASR	oh she was always doing stuff where the other two girls were you know very nice
wright204a_958.521_3.91.wav_ASR	and it was all nice and stuff for for them
wright204a_962.813_18.18.wav_ASR	oh when they went to the the b oh when they turned out that the one who they put the show on
wright204a_982.77_14.44.wav_ASR	he uh then one i got away because it was a oh a sponge that's gonna turn into a p oh she had the stage coach is gonna turn into a pump in to a p oh she had to get back
wright204a_997.767_7.21.wav_ASR	and uh oh see uh she lost her shell
wright204a_1006.404_0.31.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_1007.312_9.14.wav_ASR	and so then when the people i guess one of the people for the the
wright204a_1018.414_1.11.wav_ASR	what will i want to add
wright204a_1019.765_5.209.wav_ASR	that's that's this
wright204a_1026.704_2.301.wav_ASR	so this is my trouble with this story
wright204a_1029.076_5.01.wav_ASR	ah we're trying to get oh the yeah
wright204a_1037.097_1.48.wav_ASR	it's the print it's the print
wright204a_1039.786_3.76.wav_ASR	and he he he had the he was trying to find
wright204a_1044.411_1.69.wav_ASR	and uh he was out looking
wright204a_1047.777_0.92.wav_ASR	we had the fruit
wright204a_1049.77_4.47.wav_ASR	and it this show the only one that really fit
wright204a_1055.312_1.88.wav_ASR	oh so i think it's
wright204a_1057.679_2.63.wav_ASR	uh we'll be man in white
wright204a_1060.912_1.76.wav_ASR	you'll everything will be fine forever
wright204a_1067.508_0.34.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_1076.539_0.49.wav_ASR	oh yeah
wright204a_1077.591_1.12.wav_ASR	it's my favourite
wright204a_1081.112_3.04.wav_ASR	oh you did you need two pieces of red
wright204a_1084.91_1.51.wav_ASR	and we need the battery
wright204a_1086.66_0.79.wav_ASR	we need
wright204a_1087.972_1.83.wav_ASR	and i i don't put button on it
wright204a_1089.96_0.57.wav_ASR	just put
wright204a_1091.312_1.41.wav_ASR	oh i should just
wright204a_1092.847_1.09.wav_ASR	it don't do that anymore
wright204a_1093.952_6.07.wav_ASR	actually my wife does it now until i can get this hand around because it's s kind of week
wright204a_1100.249_6.65.wav_ASR	oh the anyway oh you put uh red on uh i put a button on the one
wright204a_1107.215_1.62.wav_ASR	and you put the g. l. on the other
wright204a_1109.293_0.88.wav_ASR	oh the second
wright204a_1110.995_0.48.wav_ASR	slide show
wright204a_1116.724_6.94.wav_ASR	oh i you know i've i had p. n. button and yellow as a child all the way up through now
wright204a_1125.475_2.17.wav_ASR	so it's that one of my that's one of my favourite
wright207a_23.754_0.32.wav_ASR	okay
wright207a_29.903_0.38.wav_ASR	yeah

wright207a_625.32_0.44.wav_ASR	okay
wright207a_631.507_1.04.wav_ASR	it okay
wright207a_634.619_0.48.wav_ASR	okay
wright207a_726.673_7.06.wav_ASR	um r uh uh scenario uh is a slide
wright207a_736.659_11.06.wav_ASR	but um the all of them um a scenario is going to order
wright207a_749.437_9.22.wav_ASR	and um
wright207a_758.714_4.38.wav_ASR	and uh in the in the r. a. is this pretty
wright207a_765.598_7.05.wav_ASR	uh s uh um the d yeah
wright207a_773.957_6.08.wav_ASR	that uh scenario um one to y yeah
wright207a_780.183_7.39.wav_ASR	but s um standard is uh is pretty pretty
wright207a_788.169_0.75.wav_ASR	yeah
wright207a_790.175_16.2.wav_ASR	but i guess the all of um assistants want to take um
wright207a_810.512_6.23.wav_ASR	and i guess um a scenario is uh
wright207a_816.94_2.0.wav_ASR	oh
wright207a_820.258_3.0.wav_ASR	it's in the l. c. d. is it's
wright207a_823.47_5.16.wav_ASR	but yeah it's smaller than usual
wright207a_829.793_5.83.wav_ASR	it's um s sh yeah shoes yeah shoes
wright207a_837.522_7.49.wav_ASR	uh the battery that uh is a s shoes
wright207a_845.643_3.62.wav_ASR	ex an add on this
wright207a_852.218_6.11.wav_ASR	uh in general is uh only in fifth in his fourth his
