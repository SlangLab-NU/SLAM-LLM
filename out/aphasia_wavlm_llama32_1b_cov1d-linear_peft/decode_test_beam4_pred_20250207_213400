fridriksson07a_1162.249_4.76.wav_ASR	and then the clock strikes twelve
fridriksson07a_1167.86_3.01.wav_ASR	and she ran out but she lost the slipper
fridriksson07a_1172.448_1.9.wav_ASR	and then they found the slipper
fridriksson07a_1174.419_9.12.wav_ASR	and then by the time she got back her her her chair had turned into a pumpkin

fridriksson07a_1198.045_4.27.wav_ASR	so they tried it with the two stepsisters and it didn't fit
fridriksson07a_1203.12_4.56.wav_ASR	so then they ask cinderella to try it
fridriksson07a_1207.7_1.21.wav_ASR	and they were just
fridriksson07a_1209.733_1.54.wav_ASR	oh no she wasn't even there

kansas04a_56.809_9.79.wav_ASR	and then i went out with my friends and they were concerned because i was driving rapidly
kansas04a_68.079_9.21.wav_ASR	she said that i drove too close to cars and i had difficulty with my speech
kansas04a_77.957_5.16.wav_ASR	and i went home and i met my husband at the locker wall
kansas04a_84.83_3.35.wav_ASR	and had a drink and i went home
kansas04a_88.529_5.344.wav_ASR	that was not my usual way of doing
kansas04a_95.153_1.87.wav_ASR	don't talking to anybody or anything
kansas04a_97.072_3.29.wav_ASR	and so i went home and and i went to bed at night
kansas04a_100.589_2.91.wav_ASR	and i got up the next morning and went to work
kansas04a_104.276_4.63.wav_ASR	went to a her chamber meeting
kansas04a_109.508_10.63.wav_ASR	and i park and went in and when i came back out i noticed that i parked very bad
kansas04a_121.372_4.48.wav_ASR	and i went to work and then one of the girls came in and said
kansas04a_126.873_2.64.wav_ASR	you're not using your arm correctly
kansas04a_131.007_0.4.wav_ASR	alright
kansas04a_131.688_1.2.wav_ASR	three i think i'm having a stroke
kansas04a_133.315_0.93.wav_ASR	call the doctor
kansas04a_134.744_8.79.wav_ASR	and she told me to go to the emergency room and not to drive
kansas04a_144.096_13.82.wav_ASR	and at that point i was confused enough that i was thinking about the ambulance across the street from my office
kansas04a_158.827_1.8.wav_ASR	so i think it i drove myself
kansas04a_161.92_1.11.wav_ASR	so i drove myself
kansas04a_163.284_3.31.wav_ASR	and i got out there park and the poor place
kansas04a_167.312_3.2.wav_ASR	and went in and and then i met my husband there
kansas04a_170.986_6.08.wav_ASR	and i told him to tell them what what i thought
kansas04a_177.562_3.58.wav_ASR	because i could not communicate at that point
kansas04a_182.356_4.06.wav_ASR	and i was there for overnight and they sent me home
kansas04a_187.406_9.41.wav_ASR	and then i did not feel well the next morning so i i had him take me back to the hospital and i stayed for a couple weeks
kansas04a_207.011_5.1.wav_ASR	well i had therapy and all my speech and writing
kansas04a_213.604_6.17.wav_ASR	but they didn't give it to me for very long
kansas04a_220.931_5.04.wav_ASR	me i was just when i was in the hospital i had my speech and and writing therapy
kansas04a_226.382_3.15.wav_ASR	and then i got home and had some physical therapy
kansas04a_259.052_0.729.wav_ASR	excuse me
kansas04a_263.423_8.6.wav_ASR	well when i got married the first time i hadta plan my whole wedding myself because mom was much older
kansas04a_273.102_2.34.wav_ASR	and she left it up to me
kansas04a_276.529_5.33.wav_ASR	and i went home and then went back to la
kansas04a_281.881_3.75.wav_ASR	and i got married in lausanne in january
kansas04a_294.955_9.48.wav_ASR	and we had dinner and then we went back to the hotel
kansas04a_304.94_3.42.wav_ASR	and my little girl married me
kansas04a_309.335_2.86.wav_ASR	he's a master of mess
kansas04a_313.018_7.98.wav_ASR	and his wife took over the bathroom didn't get left my sister in there
kansas04a_322.108_15.2.wav_ASR	and so then we went to the chapel and on the way my brother inlaw was driving and he almost rushed
kansas04a_342.23_1.91.wav_ASR	three i think that will be enough for that story
kansas04a_369.621_4.36.wav_ASR	well this little boy is practicing his soccer ball
kansas04a_376.048_2.66.wav_ASR	and then he kicks it through the window
kansas04a_379.812_1.49.wav_ASR	and it breaks the window
kansas04a_382.375_3.03.wav_ASR	and it goes into this man's house
kansas04a_386.256_1.9.wav_ASR	and he's very startled
kansas04a_389.349_6.47.wav_ASR	and he gets up and looks out the window to see where it came from
kansas04a_396.096_10.7.wav_ASR	well it does not tell you whether the boy ran away or whether he came and confused that he had kicked the soccer ball
kansas04a_435.24_4.79.wav_ASR	mother wants the little boy to take the umbrella
kansas04a_443.068_1.73.wav_ASR	he doesn't wanna take the umbrella
kansas04a_446.585_4.68.wav_ASR	so it goes out and it starts to rain of course as his mother had told him it would
kansas04a_452.243_1.56.wav_ASR	so he goes back
kansas04a_454.24_0.91.wav_ASR	he tells him
kansas04a_455.171_1.15.wav_ASR	and he's very wet
kansas04a_457.426_5.56.wav_ASR	so we go back in the house and she's very angry with him because he hasn't taken the umbrella
kansas04a_463.777_7.44.wav_ASR	so in the last picture he has the umbrella and it's up and he's walking very happily
kansas04a_506.81_1.84.wav_ASR	well the cat is in the tree
kansas04a_510.155_1.81.wav_ASR	dog is barking at the cat
kansas04a_513.126_4.38.wav_ASR	and the little girl is crying because her cat is in the tree
kansas04a_519.099_8.07.wav_ASR	and her father tried to get it with a ladder and the ladder has fallen down
kansas04a_527.276_4.41.wav_ASR	and the father is still in the tree and he's looking very glo
kansas04a_532.649_2.56.wav_ASR	and the birds are singing
kansas04a_537.485_4.46.wav_ASR	that's rather quick as everything else is going on
kansas04a_542.482_5.22.wav_ASR	and the firemen have been called and they're going to hafta get the cat down
kansas04a_547.988_3.8.wav_ASR	but i think before they do they hafta get daddy down
kansas04a_576.487_1.57.wav_ASR	there's been a flood
kansas04a_582.466_4.23.wav_ASR	and this lady has been swept away in the flood
kansas04a_590.504_12.69.wav_ASR	and this gentleman in the jacket is coming to rescue her
kansas04a_604.912_6.77.wav_ASR	is been swept away in the flood all so it looks to me
kansas04a_613.723_13.02.wav_ASR	and i do not quite understand this part
kansas04a_634.622_1.22.wav_ASR	yeah i think
kansas04a_636.851_1.21.wav_ASR	you know what is that
kansas04a_643.48_6.31.wav_ASR	yeah but which one is being replaced in which one isn't
kansas04a_661.844_0.6.wav_ASR	oh yes
kansas04a_668.087_0.84.wav_ASR	it's not terrible
kansas04a_688.588_0.82.wav_ASR	okay
kansas04a_756.402_5.91.wav_ASR	the story's about cinderella and a wicked stepmother and her two halfsisters
kansas04a_762.492_0.68.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
kansas04a_763.997_11.67.wav_ASR	her stepsisters were very unkind to her and her stepmother was too
kansas04a_776.051_5.38.wav_ASR	and cinderella was left to sweep and clean and do whatever they wanted done
kansas04a_782.592_7.02.wav_ASR	so they got a letter inviting the the the ball
kansas04a_791.424_5.37.wav_ASR	the mother said that cinderella could not go
kansas04a_798.1_1.62.wav_ASR	and she was very upset
kansas04a_800.608_12.89.wav_ASR	and so she tried to get her dress together and the two stepsisters tore it apart
kansas04a_815.132_22.74.wav_ASR	and so she went out and told her fairy godmother that they had turned it apart and she wasn't going to go
kansas04a_837.925_6.54.wav_ASR	and and the fairy godmother said yes she could
kansas04a_845.377_4.79.wav_ASR	they got her dressed and and with her wand of course
kansas04a_850.747_14.83.wav_ASR	and so the stepmother and stepchild started out and she did not go with them
kansas04a_865.963_15.24.wav_ASR	but she went in the carriage that the fairy godmother had created out of a pumpkin and mice and horse
kansas04a_881.57_0.95.wav_ASR	the horse
kansas04a_883.45_2.91.wav_ASR	and she went to the ball
kansas04a_887.004_4.42.wav_ASR	and the prince greeted her at the ball
kansas04a_892.03_1.55.wav_ASR	and they dance
kansas04a_893.647_1.85.wav_ASR	and then it was a twelve o'clock
kansas04a_895.645_2.1.wav_ASR	and she hadta be home by twelve o'clock
kansas04a_897.799_2.56.wav_ASR	so she ran out and lost her slipper
kansas04a_901.571_7.85.wav_ASR	and she went and got the carriage and course the carriage all along
kansas04a_909.825_1.47.wav_ASR	and she went home
kansas04a_912.607_9.82.wav_ASR	and then the following week or so time a lot
kansas04a_922.783_10.71.wav_ASR	the footmen was sent out with the slipper to find which girl in the kingdom fit
kansas04a_934.46_7.29.wav_ASR	and she was locked in her room so she could not come down
kansas04a_942.65_2.64.wav_ASR	and she was very upset
kansas04a_946.239_4.44.wav_ASR	and it's like
kansas04a_952.096_3.38.wav_ASR	and away the the the mice live out
kansas04a_957.72_3.9.wav_ASR	and she came down and and of course she fit the slipper
kansas04a_962.075_1.87.wav_ASR	but the other did not
kansas04a_972.186_1.4.wav_ASR	yes
kansas04a_981.336_5.42.wav_ASR	two pieces of bread the peanut butter and the jelly
kansas04a_988.038_1.31.wav_ASR	then i would get a knife
kansas04a_990.452_4.73.wav_ASR	and get get some of the peanut butter and spread it on one piece of bread
kansas04a_995.9_4.73.wav_ASR	and spread the jelly on the same piece of bread
kansas04a_1001.062_1.38.wav_ASR	and then put the top on it
kansas04a_1005.16_3.55.wav_ASR	oh yes i've practiced

kansas05a_364.761_2.21.wav_ASR	and i didn't mean that but
kansas05a_374.375_2.99.wav_ASR	because i wanna have as to do better
kansas05a_379.021_4.21.wav_ASR	it it's much more difficult
kansas05a_384.531_4.34.wav_ASR	you know when i look around and i see a lot of people who know
kansas05a_389.118_1.34.wav_ASR	you know they go right around here
kansas05a_390.473_0.99.wav_ASR	you don't talk to people
kansas05a_391.485_2.95.wav_ASR	people had different opinions
kansas05a_394.676_3.96.wav_ASR	you know i have no problems with my eating my legs you know and all that
kansas05a_398.681_2.2.wav_ASR	and i don't have any problems particular
kansas05a_401.308_2.97.wav_ASR	as time gone on i hadta get better
kansas05a_405.255_6.03.wav_ASR	but no we're we're what's i going
kansas05a_411.561_1.63.wav_ASR	what are you asking me again
kansas05a_420.085_1.64.wav_ASR	oh yeah so i was talking about right
kansas05a_422.593_9.96.wav_ASR	we're i'm working a lot with working more more
kansas05a_434.918_3.07.wav_ASR	as time goes on i learn more and more what to do
kansas05a_439.556_1.65.wav_ASR	and so that's what i'm doing
kansas05a_467.065_0.97.wav_ASR	so they come different
kansas05a_468.95_4.67.wav_ASR	see tell me the story with a beginning a middle and an end
kansas05a_473.861_0.95.wav_ASR	if each one
kansas05a_480.821_2.29.wav_ASR	so each one of these i'm sposta do something with it
kansas05a_483.43_0.79.wav_ASR	they're that what you're saying
kansas05a_497.343_0.77.wav_ASR	oh
kansas05a_504.475_17.939.wav_ASR	well the first one is learning through this this this mess
kansas05a_529.355_7.84.wav_ASR	it's a a problem
kansas05a_540.213_11.2.wav_ASR	that well with a a a plan or or similar
kansas05a_554.453_7.16.wav_ASR	there's a friend eating with that this one
kansas05a_563.678_3.27.wav_ASR	because these these people are making a problem
kansas05a_580.09_0.63.wav_ASR	what is that
kansas05a_589.826_1.82.wav_ASR	oh that's kinda dumb stuff
kansas05a_593.266_2.41.wav_ASR	and i think that takes a little work to make that look right
kansas05a_596.395_2.36.wav_ASR	okay i'm sposta
kansas05a_600.809_1.48.wav_ASR	what am i sposta do with this one
kansas05a_603.491_0.94.wav_ASR	what's it a fair
kansas05a_605.0_1.13.wav_ASR	did the window break
kansas05a_608.523_1.45.wav_ASR	okay well that's it then
kansas05a_643.723_19.47.wav_ASR	so the the first person is a problem there
kansas05a_666.113_5.28.wav_ASR	they're they're beautiful
kansas05a_674.141_4.53.wav_ASR	looking at the trees again
kansas05a_681.195_14.69.wav_ASR	and and believing that the second people should
kansas05a_702.031_0.71.wav_ASR	and i think so
kansas05a_703.736_3.14.wav_ASR	he he's not sposta do that for him
kansas05a_708.008_3.8.wav_ASR	but this one guy wants to come down
kansas05a_712.325_1.15.wav_ASR	or he wants to buy myself
kansas05a_715.293_1.03.wav_ASR	it's not quite right but
kansas05a_718.205_0.34.wav_ASR	what
kansas05a_719.0_0.38.wav_ASR	which one
kansas05a_721.863_10.62.wav_ASR	there he's looking out for four on the the the the the chairs and how to deal with those things
kansas05a_732.528_5.87.wav_ASR	the the old stuff that's been afraid there
kansas05a_740.616_16.13.wav_ASR	there the the mother is not not happy with her her person of what went all the the the little problems that they look here together
kansas05a_759.633_4.72.wav_ASR	well he's back there again
kansas05a_764.921_0.88.wav_ASR	oh i see
kansas05a_766.03_12.56.wav_ASR	his mother wanted him to go back to the good stuff he was done before so that he can go back on to this this kind of stuff again that make him look better
kansas05a_779.24_4.95.wav_ASR	and he goes back and the ideas that he's got and make them go back and look look better
kansas05a_812.463_2.81.wav_ASR	well i guess you'd start with that
kansas05a_819.976_6.9.wav_ASR	people sitting with their their their stuff around
kansas05a_827.928_1.1.wav_ASR	one two two
kansas05a_831.043_4.35.wav_ASR	again the kind of a business people there
kansas05a_837.143_11.29.wav_ASR	well let's see there's the the man who's trying to talk with him about that back over to that kind of stuff
kansas05a_848.486_4.42.wav_ASR	it was going to be overly carried by this younger stuff
kansas05a_854.133_3.71.wav_ASR	it's big enough to make that kind of stuff
kansas05a_859.378_4.24.wav_ASR	then they'd be this thing doesn't really
kansas05a_864.8_5.88.wav_ASR	the isn't necessarily what's going on here but it's there
kansas05a_872.161_11.16.wav_ASR	here's the the the leave leave
kansas05a_888.045_3.84.wav_ASR	the person just putting this stuff together
kansas05a_893.315_5.28.wav_ASR	he's got a person ready to help him with that
kansas05a_899.503_11.32.wav_ASR	here's improvement to him from the the people down inside trying to put this together with a new set
kansas05a_911.256_10.74.wav_ASR	here's the young person who's trying to put that money back back here so it goes every way and all of these things
kansas05a_922.725_3.13.wav_ASR	and then there is a national

202-2_2417.585_2.25.wav_ASR	and and that's
71-1_11.65_2.76.wav_ASR	my goodness
71-1_14.65_0.62.wav_ASR	oh it would be
71-1_16.35_1.349.wav_ASR	would be the one to bring up
71-1_17.699_11.7.wav_ASR	you know i could just talk about the year that well nine months really when i was twelve
71-1_29.979_4.84.wav_ASR	and i did a seminar
71-1_38.11_8.87.wav_ASR	back in my childhood you could actually go for two sessions which is what i did which is why it was nine months
71-1_47.68_7.67.wav_ASR	but what i did when i got to kootenay avenue we had this amazing event which you could take classes at the university
71-1_56.18_2.36.wav_ASR	for the first semester i took classes
71-1_59.16_2.453.wav_ASR	we had classes for four days of the week
71-1_61.8_1.661.wav_ASR	three days of the week we could travel
71-1_64.1_7.4.wav_ASR	the second stepmother because i met this woman who became my best friend and it was her idea she said
71-1_71.94_4.16.wav_ASR	you know we're our education is really holding us back
71-1_76.94_18.32.wav_ASR	so i think what we should do is we should we should write from the university to take our tuition money because you get most of if you with drill on the first week and then just spend the time travel
71-1_95.93_13.06.wav_ASR	so i would say for those four months in which i actually had a dormitory room that i could go back to when i needed to decompress
71-1_110.29_3.419.wav_ASR	marriage is as far south as we've gone
71-1_113.771_4.08.wav_ASR	italy France soccer
71-1_119.131_2.676.wav_ASR	we spent a fair amount of time traveling all over
71-1_121.911_2.231.wav_ASR	when you're nineteen it's a really good time to travel
71-1_124.491_2.854.wav_ASR	really good looking boys everywhere that you go
71-1_127.345_11.955.wav_ASR	and yeah i just had the most incredible large vacation desk the fact that my mother said
71-1_139.525_1.2.wav_ASR	it's helping out a school
71-1_140.804_1.257.wav_ASR	oh that's terrible
71-1_142.165_0.882.wav_ASR	you will go back
71-1_143.59_1.381.wav_ASR	oh no i'll go back next week
71-1_144.971_4.28.wav_ASR	oh but this is my opportunity to really travel
71-1_149.791_2.56.wav_ASR	as my friend firstnamem said to me
71-1_153.351_1.62.wav_ASR	her parents are back in wisconsin
71-1_155.291_0.913.wav_ASR	what are they gonna do
71-1_156.204_0.947.wav_ASR	we're in kootenay
71-1_157.791_1.89.wav_ASR	we're just gonna tell them what we're doing
71-1_160.22_5.0.wav_ASR	so if i could tell you other stories but they would probably
71-1_165.44_2.1.wav_ASR	so we wanted to all the details
71-1_174.46_3.52.wav_ASR	five i'd say it was illinois because i met my father
71-1_178.1_6.44.wav_ASR	my father's family was only two generations from immigration to the united states
71-1_184.94_5.88.wav_ASR	and they're in brownstone stone which is in the western county of gold
71-1_191.32_5.02.wav_ASR	and so i actually meet with other cousins second cousins
71-1_196.572_2.608.wav_ASR	that's you're what the exact location is
71-1_199.432_1.95.wav_ASR	but i met people that were part of my family
71-1_201.692_7.006.wav_ASR	and i'dungeers or second or third cousins that looked exactly like my father and my uncle
71-1_209.352_4.804.wav_ASR	yeah that was the little extra on spending i think yeah
71-1_236.89_0.84.wav_ASR	it comes and goes
71-1_238.25_4.65.wav_ASR	and i would say that the main problem with my language is that it's unrelatable
71-1_243.73_5.13.wav_ASR	as i said a few minutes ago i was talking about going
71-1_249.84_4.21.wav_ASR	and what's interesting is that it's the valves that i have issues with
71-1_254.46_2.14.wav_ASR	oh i could not say umbrella
71-1_257.12_1.089.wav_ASR	and i think i said a stroke
71-1_258.58_0.629.wav_ASR	then i said
71-1_259.68_6.89.wav_ASR	well i was really thinking in my brain how to walk around that or figure that out or feel that out on my own
71-1_267.01_2.96.wav_ASR	and i continue to visit
71-1_270.27_1.84.wav_ASR	and i didn't invite that happening
71-1_272.61_2.16.wav_ASR	but i better than i was
71-1_275.11_5.22.wav_ASR	and i still have difficulty with comprehension
71-1_281.15_1.54.wav_ASR	it's still oh
71-1_282.906_4.581.wav_ASR	well that i have been always been confusing to other people
71-1_287.466_3.295.wav_ASR	and i do remember back what it was like when i was eating before the stroke
71-1_291.106_1.62.wav_ASR	and people would look puddle
71-1_293.566_0.577.wav_ASR	and then it was like
71-1_294.446_0.82.wav_ASR	it's their problem
71-1_295.586_5.857.wav_ASR	one of the times i'm pretty sure it's because i said something that didn't make any sense
71-1_301.443_11.647.wav_ASR	so i'm still trying to work on explaining complicated things to people and trying to correct myself when i make a mistake
71-1_313.523_6.04.wav_ASR	and i do communicate on a regular basis
71-1_319.736_1.86.wav_ASR	so it's frustrating
71-1_321.916_8.864.wav_ASR	but i keep practicing it to the point that many people don't think i have aphasia until they do notice that i have aphasia
71-1_331.276_5.44.wav_ASR	so i can communicate but not well and not the way that i used to be able to communicate
71-1_347.09_0.959.wav_ASR	oh very much
71-1_348.131_1.199.wav_ASR	alright alright
71-1_350.191_0.82.wav_ASR	oh
71-1_357.66_4.863.wav_ASR	well i didn't know that it was a stroke which is very typical
71-1_363.04_1.71.wav_ASR	umbrella i had one before
71-1_364.78_1.964.wav_ASR	so how would i know what a stroke was
71-1_366.88_4.114.wav_ASR	well i was alert waking up
71-1_371.1_1.984.wav_ASR	it was january fifth
71-1_373.42_4.0.wav_ASR	that was a day when i you know that's the day when the restaurant stopped
71-1_377.8_1.688.wav_ASR	so i hafta get out there
71-1_379.52_2.533.wav_ASR	and i needta start working again harder than i been
71-1_382.16_0.893.wav_ASR	and i was at it
71-1_384.16_2.555.wav_ASR	and i worked the help out man
71-1_386.84_1.385.wav_ASR	mean i think i did eight miles
71-1_388.82_3.88.wav_ASR	my heart rate was up to a hundred seven
71-1_393.18_0.64.wav_ASR	gone
71-1_394.24_0.819.wav_ASR	you keep this up
71-1_395.34_2.9.wav_ASR	yeah i and i wasn't tired
71-1_398.62_0.92.wav_ASR	it wasn't fake
71-1_400.16_11.482.wav_ASR	and i got off the elevator and had trouble with two more miles mostly because the blank paper was on
71-1_412.0_1.26.wav_ASR	thank you
71-1_413.3_0.677.wav_ASR	but that was on
71-1_413.977_4.84.wav_ASR	and i thought i wanted to watch it because really like chat with
71-1_419.837_1.766.wav_ASR	oh well i was walking
71-1_422.137_2.144.wav_ASR	and again i had trouble with it
71-1_425.157_2.023.wav_ASR	oh i just didn't feel good anymore
71-1_427.66_7.131.wav_ASR	went home and had a dinner club hey on my right side
71-1_434.94_0.52.wav_ASR	and i just said
71-1_435.94_1.381.wav_ASR	oh no idea what that
71-1_437.76_2.145.wav_ASR	so i of course enjoyed it and hadta sleep
71-1_440.66_2.93.wav_ASR	the next day i couldn't work it on
71-1_443.78_1.7.wav_ASR	was trying to write a conference report
71-1_445.86_0.64.wav_ASR	nothing would
71-1_446.77_1.3.wav_ASR	and i couldn't do
71-1_449.31_3.735.wav_ASR	so i went to get my head my hair cut the next day
71-1_453.11_3.247.wav_ASR	and i wanted to calm because i had really bad headache
71-1_456.67_2.13.wav_ASR	but if you cascade you hadta pay for it
71-1_459.29_1.889.wav_ASR	and my hair you know it be cut
71-1_461.93_0.942.wav_ASR	oh i
71-1_462.93_1.662.wav_ASR	and i live alone
71-1_464.592_2.463.wav_ASR	so i hadn't really talked to anybody in two years
71-1_467.512_1.658.wav_ASR	down in the chair
71-1_469.572_2.734.wav_ASR	and i couldn't tell her how i wanted to get my hair cut
71-1_473.192_2.18.wav_ASR	and i couldn't say
71-1_476.352_4.42.wav_ASR	so i couldn't tell her that i'd been wearing slipper
71-1_481.512_1.76.wav_ASR	but i don't know what was coming
71-1_483.692_0.608.wav_ASR	and i was told
71-1_484.66_2.06.wav_ASR	and she's looking
71-1_486.78_1.691.wav_ASR	but she had no idea what i was talking
71-1_489.8_0.46.wav_ASR	oh i see
71-1_490.62_1.01.wav_ASR	oh something's wrong
71-1_492.54_1.8.wav_ASR	so i told her
71-1_494.62_0.3.wav_ASR	and i said
71-1_495.129_0.678.wav_ASR	like here
71-1_497.02_2.56.wav_ASR	so she luckily she didn't have a headache
71-1_499.94_1.89.wav_ASR	but she caught her hair the way i
71-1_502.08_0.3.wav_ASR	alright
71-1_502.46_3.93.wav_ASR	you know better to go call a doctor because this doesn't make any sense
71-1_507.5_2.1.wav_ASR	so i i i try
71-1_510.16_4.24.wav_ASR	and i think this is something that must happen with people that have strokes is that they
71-1_516.46_3.62.wav_ASR	and i looked up the number that i was sposta call arlington clinic
71-1_520.22_1.589.wav_ASR	and this was already six o'clock
71-1_522.35_2.64.wav_ASR	and it had all these shoes
71-1_526.21_3.46.wav_ASR	if it's an immediate emergency go to call nineoneone
71-1_530.13_0.33.wav_ASR	and i thought
71-1_530.61_0.757.wav_ASR	alright
71-1_531.59_3.737.wav_ASR	just trying to make a point in front of the engineering team
71-1_536.11_0.706.wav_ASR	and then it said
71-1_537.11_3.2.wav_ASR	if it's this situation called
71-1_540.703_4.014.wav_ASR	and if it's this situation call you know press three
71-1_545.023_2.16.wav_ASR	if it's this situation call
71-1_548.083_3.82.wav_ASR	unfortunately if you stayed on for two and half minutes they finally say
71-1_552.343_1.811.wav_ASR	real person will come on the line
71-1_555.283_1.601.wav_ASR	but my headache
71-1_557.243_0.593.wav_ASR	and i'm just going
71-1_557.903_1.16.wav_ASR	well this is help
71-1_559.46_2.24.wav_ASR	so i hung up the phone and said

71-1_563.38_2.36.wav_ASR	oh see if i anybody will answer the phone
71-1_566.68_1.06.wav_ASR	but tell my daughter
71-1_568.34_4.12.wav_ASR	and she she was very frightened
71-1_573.0_0.6.wav_ASR	you just said
71-1_573.7_1.12.wav_ASR	don't sound like yourself
71-1_576.13_1.22.wav_ASR	you needta go take an ambulance
71-1_577.9_1.29.wav_ASR	and i'm gonna pay for an ambulance
71-1_579.24_0.78.wav_ASR	it's just ridiculous
71-1_580.52_1.22.wav_ASR	yeah yeah

71-1_664.74_1.961.wav_ASR	it was just this huge
71-1_667.8_1.86.wav_ASR	it's racing around and jelly
71-1_670.22_6.1.wav_ASR	all the sudden they had me in for a cat scan and came out and said
71-1_676.5_1.02.wav_ASR	yeah you had a stroke
71-1_678.32_2.727.wav_ASR	so i asked the doctor
71-1_681.06_3.681.wav_ASR	and he showed me on the cat scan exactly what had happened
71-1_685.44_3.23.wav_ASR	and they attended
71-1_689.38_2.962.wav_ASR	so that's the part i found out i had a stroke
71-1_692.75_6.56.wav_ASR	yeah i i really have had no issues what so ever with mice mice feet
71-1_699.81_1.65.wav_ASR	but i had my own
71-1_702.78_2.04.wav_ASR	and i just didn't know about the headache
71-1_705.03_0.95.wav_ASR	we've never had one again
71-1_706.88_1.18.wav_ASR	never had umbrella
71-1_708.53_7.93.wav_ASR	but apparently if you get a really really bad headache that hits you on the side of the head it means you should probably go to the emergency room
71-1_717.45_2.54.wav_ASR	oh i don't know if that gave you
71-1_720.582_1.363.wav_ASR	it doesn't give you a lot of insight
71-1_722.34_8.435.wav_ASR	again if i'd remember immediately right after i had the headache it's sposta be a little that they could have stopped it
71-1_731.3_3.77.wav_ASR	the window of operation had this
71-1_737.18_5.617.wav_ASR	but it wasn't a skiing stroke not a emergency stroke
71-1_743.84_6.846.wav_ASR	and they obviously decided it was critical because they've not been able to find out why i had it
71-1_751.22_7.24.wav_ASR	all of my numbers are middle numbers are good
71-1_758.94_0.8.wav_ASR	oh not tie back
71-1_760.32_0.82.wav_ASR	and i don't smoke
71-1_762.02_1.88.wav_ASR	and i have a little blood pressure
71-1_764.42_2.25.wav_ASR	everything looks
71-1_767.76_1.39.wav_ASR	but i did indeed have a stroke
71-1_769.54_2.64.wav_ASR	so something happens somewhere
71-1_772.78_3.16.wav_ASR	and in the hospital i got to watch the insurance
71-1_776.46_0.954.wav_ASR	and it's just
71-1_780.18_0.96.wav_ASR	three yeah right
71-1_781.58_4.48.wav_ASR	yeah so yeah so two years later here
71-1_797.2_17.56.wav_ASR	well again and if i ever get to the point that i'm articulate enough about this i'm going to use my little spanish aphasia and and research and do something more about getting people some kind of tree
71-1_814.772_2.553.wav_ASR	and i was given almost nothing
71-1_817.552_3.086.wav_ASR	partially i think it was because
71-1_820.772_2.485.wav_ASR	it really matches with a major city like san francisco it's a major city
71-1_823.472_6.42.wav_ASR	so i should have been able to get the best time of help me
71-1_830.372_0.477.wav_ASR	and i did
71-1_830.849_4.78.wav_ASR	the best i could get was we found two speech therapist
71-1_836.569_2.232.wav_ASR	one of them only surprised him in childhood
71-1_839.189_1.351.wav_ASR	so i didn't work with you
71-1_840.909_0.92.wav_ASR	the other person
71-1_842.229_4.18.wav_ASR	it's a little one hour a week
71-1_847.59_16.523.wav_ASR	and basically because i am an accountant because i have the ability to read commentate and because that part of my brain wasn't unheard of in any way i hadta do my own research
71-1_864.29_2.08.wav_ASR	and i hadta do a lot of reading
71-1_866.55_4.28.wav_ASR	and the the speech pathologist it not physician's therapist
71-1_871.09_0.612.wav_ASR	very different
71-1_872.39_3.118.wav_ASR	but she i mean she helped me a lot i would say
71-1_875.61_2.902.wav_ASR	so i should be looking up on this particular thing
71-1_878.63_2.25.wav_ASR	and i should be a little taller
71-1_881.53_3.02.wav_ASR	but she had kept up with it either
71-1_884.71_4.16.wav_ASR	but she hadn't learned about some of the most recent treatments that were available
71-1_889.53_7.52.wav_ASR	so basically what i did is i went back to exercise as soon as they allowed me
71-1_897.35_2.7.wav_ASR	three i couldn't work out for three months
71-1_900.34_5.67.wav_ASR	and i could only walk because they were concerned that my physical limit had something to do with the
71-1_906.42_0.66.wav_ASR	and she
71-1_909.64_1.189.wav_ASR	oh i just hadta walk
71-1_911.14_1.081.wav_ASR	and i had
71-1_913.2_1.401.wav_ASR	they tested me for aphasia
71-1_914.74_3.28.wav_ASR	and i hadta wear this for about three months
71-1_918.17_2.86.wav_ASR	but i don't have aphasia either so
71-1_921.33_2.315.wav_ASR	but i focus on driving
71-1_924.37_4.82.wav_ASR	really wasn't drinking much alcohol at all then
71-1_930.27_1.38.wav_ASR	and i stopped to complain
71-1_932.87_2.66.wav_ASR	so now i'm back exercise is much as i can
71-1_935.83_2.18.wav_ASR	and i'm really careful in terms of my die
71-1_938.49_7.52.wav_ASR	and i really focus on improvement living it and turns of my life and what i
71-1_947.57_2.29.wav_ASR	and i write every day
71-1_950.51_1.38.wav_ASR	alright i'll join every day
71-1_951.89_3.934.wav_ASR	right now i'm trying to write an article which i hope to get published
71-1_955.824_20.3.wav_ASR	because that's maybe the hardest thing for my brain that i've ever hadta do before the stroke or after the stroke or rather is the ability to weave together in a really dense
71-1_976.405_1.819.wav_ASR	so he's trying hard
71-1_978.345_9.56.wav_ASR	and i read a lot every day the news papers because i think same words is a way of reading those
71-1_988.605_2.865.wav_ASR	whether it's the fires that were there
71-1_991.665_2.454.wav_ASR	just needta learn how to say a word
71-1_994.405_0.82.wav_ASR	umbrella umbrella
71-1_995.479_4.388.wav_ASR	and i'll probably be able to say that a lot for a long time until the week
71-1_999.919_4.279.wav_ASR	and then i'll miss miss pronounce that one again
71-1_1005.119_5.531.wav_ASR	but that's really all i know how to do is keep it up until
71-1_1011.439_0.611.wav_ASR	and sleep
71-1_1012.379_2.191.wav_ASR	and i always sleep
71-1_1014.87_2.86.wav_ASR	and i generally have gone without it
71-1_1018.68_1.81.wav_ASR	you know if you stay late you're doing something
71-1_1020.89_3.12.wav_ASR	but you still hafta get up because you have a class or you've got stuff to do
71-1_1024.67_8.638.wav_ASR	try me make sure i always have at least eight or nine hours a week to be able to sleep
71-1_1033.308_3.68.wav_ASR	and and that seems to be something that i didn't needta do before
71-1_1037.181_1.688.wav_ASR	now i really do needta do it
71-1_1038.968_2.762.wav_ASR	but that's fine
71-1_1042.028_0.872.wav_ASR	still working
71-1_1043.248_1.404.wav_ASR	but i'm not able to teach
71-1_1045.089_3.024.wav_ASR	you can see what i would be like in ninety minutes
71-1_1048.268_0.89.wav_ASR	they get fun to play
71-1_1049.328_0.769.wav_ASR	they start talking
71-1_1050.288_0.602.wav_ASR	people will be
71-1_1051.388_0.52.wav_ASR	okay
71-1_1052.271_0.5.wav_ASR	yeah
71-1_1054.451_1.998.wav_ASR	so maybe that'll come
71-1_1056.791_0.58.wav_ASR	and i can do it
71-1_1058.051_3.74.wav_ASR	and i could teach through online stuff
71-1_1062.471_2.149.wav_ASR	but so for i'm just doing other stuff
71-1_1064.971_1.119.wav_ASR	but i did a lot of teaching
71-1_1067.49_1.36.wav_ASR	well see if i get back to it again
71-1_1069.371_0.419.wav_ASR	and i don't know
71-1_1070.87_1.35.wav_ASR	enough so that's what i do
71-1_1072.81_4.64.wav_ASR	and and and i think doing it completely is really really important
71-1_1077.79_2.66.wav_ASR	and i just keep pushing myself to do different things
71-1_1081.13_6.08.wav_ASR	there's a little nothing that i'm not forcing myself to
71-1_1087.51_0.909.wav_ASR	it's not forcing myself
71-1_1088.69_2.265.wav_ASR	the second thing i go through every single day
71-1_1091.81_2.36.wav_ASR	and i do yoga every night
71-1_1094.51_1.1.wav_ASR	and i think that's usual
71-1_1096.57_1.69.wav_ASR	and i i don't know
71-1_1098.26_19.94.wav_ASR	again i'm always looking at research always trying to find something that's going to improve my hearing and some way or other to the extent that my brain will be able to repeat those language parts since that's is what was destroyed
71-1_1119.04_7.42.wav_ASR	five i spent a few minutes a time trying to figure out why a right hand person with the stroke on the right side ended up with aphasia
71-1_1127.38_10.66.wav_ASR	but i mean other than the fact that it doesn't qualify me for many clinical trials because they do file the left hand stroke
71-1_1138.248_3.801.wav_ASR	other than that i guess i just don't worry about it all that much
71-1_1142.228_13.0.wav_ASR	and i'm just doing what i can to try to heal and realize on normal place to be able to take four take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take take
71-1_1155.48_9.755.wav_ASR	but i do understand that at my age in my sixties it's less like it's much as helpful as hearing is
71-1_1165.72_1.66.wav_ASR	so i don't know
71-1_1167.66_0.67.wav_ASR	help see what
71-1_1168.91_6.48.wav_ASR	just watch it every day this experience in work or this work in progress
71-1_1175.93_2.077.wav_ASR	how it comes out and how it doesn't come out
71-1_1178.67_1.08.wav_ASR	well see yeah
71-1_1179.91_1.98.wav_ASR	all the people don't know i have aphasia
71-1_1182.17_12.68.wav_ASR	and i like keeping it that way because the there's a stigma attached to having a disability even if it's in physical
71-1_1196.42_8.392.wav_ASR	just think i might spoke then then think that they hafta speak very carefully around me
71-1_1205.08_4.784.wav_ASR	oh i i rather just see if i can just wing it
71-1_1210.7_3.66.wav_ASR	so yeah very few people know that i have aphasia
71-1_1214.592_1.416.wav_ASR	please family members know
71-1_1216.008_3.437.wav_ASR	but i don't tell anyone else about
71-1_1219.768_1.825.wav_ASR	just trying to figure it out
71-1_1242.33_1.36.wav_ASR	and it should be something important
71-1_1246.83_4.6.wav_ASR	well you know i i guess i would
71-1_1251.764_12.94.wav_ASR	something that i would say as being very important for me was working with a manager elder who
71-1_1266.024_2.112.wav_ASR	very close to work
71-1_1268.136_3.957.wav_ASR	and i met firstnamea there about ten years ago
71-1_1273.036_2.404.wav_ASR	but probably more fifteen years at this point
71-1_1276.336_2.78.wav_ASR	and i was teaching at a university
71-1_1279.476_1.38.wav_ASR	and invited her too
71-1_1280.996_6.4.wav_ASR	and i was the assistant of the nation's organization because my research is on state travel
71-1_1287.93_7.06.wav_ASR	and i invited her to come and speak in one of my classes
71-1_1295.79_0.926.wav_ASR	and she came down
71-1_1297.17_2.48.wav_ASR	and we hit it off with each other
71-1_1300.24_3.96.wav_ASR	and she was one of the most magical people that i've ever met
71-1_1304.73_5.19.wav_ASR	he was the oldest in a family of eleven
71-1_1310.55_3.42.wav_ASR	he grew up on the monotonous road with about running water
71-1_1315.01_5.11.wav_ASR	the first person to get a college degree from her try
71-1_1321.04_3.68.wav_ASR	and she became the first female trial chief
71-1_1325.92_7.08.wav_ASR	and in the last ten years i would say we've gone on trips together
71-1_1333.92_3.12.wav_ASR	and generally because as she's getting older she's under eighty
71-1_1337.32_0.87.wav_ASR	so she lets me drive
71-1_1339.05_7.74.wav_ASR	and you go to different events or different years in which she's going to offer
71-1_1347.67_7.05.wav_ASR	what i've learned from hanging out with this woman who's impressive is the word i would use
71-1_1355.21_1.06.wav_ASR	yeah
71-1_1356.984_2.503.wav_ASR	but she doesn't see that well anymore
71-1_1359.704_1.4.wav_ASR	and she's trouble reading any more
71-1_1361.57_3.02.wav_ASR	but she has me write speech for her
71-1_1365.124_1.586.wav_ASR	and she gets up and presents
71-1_1366.71_12.02.wav_ASR	and she refuses to to listen to the the the response no
71-1_1379.45_3.74.wav_ASR	but she will find away to pour on through
71-1_1384.07_3.535.wav_ASR	and she gets things done that other people have not done
71-1_1387.89_9.96.wav_ASR	and why i see this is important is my own mother is very pleased and very kind and believes that you deserve to men
71-1_1398.43_12.315.wav_ASR	and hanging out with firstnamea i have learned a great deal about what it means to be a powerful woman not to worry about it
71-1_1411.09_1.635.wav_ASR	and just get up
71-1_1412.95_0.663.wav_ASR	they say
71-1_1414.29_1.84.wav_ASR	and present your test results
71-1_1416.263_8.47.wav_ASR	and push every letter that you can leave leaving to be able to get things through that you wanna get through
71-1_1424.733_14.14.wav_ASR	so working with firstnamea over the last couple of years we've been able to stop a mine from playing which would have been really difficult
71-1_1440.7_6.776.wav_ASR	so she has been my inspiration in terms of what i learned from her
71-1_1447.78_1.68.wav_ASR	yeah it's they're really fun
71-1_1449.92_2.26.wav_ASR	so that's the other thing
71-1_1452.86_0.96.wav_ASR	yeah
71-1_1454.02_6.652.wav_ASR	he's been an on going sort of important for me i think to Molly myself after
71-1_1514.123_7.78.wav_ASR	well i mean it looks like birds with a bird who's playing with a soccer ball
71-1_1522.3_7.984.wav_ASR	and he's just on his own probably in his yard because this is something he's really interested in doing
71-1_1530.81_8.77.wav_ASR	and he picked the ball maybe a little bit too powerfully then he wanted
71-1_1540.7_3.8.wav_ASR	and it broke into the window next door
71-1_1545.58_2.64.wav_ASR	and unfortunately he broke the window
71-1_1549.0_11.31.wav_ASR	and the ball came through the window right next to the chair where his next door neighbor is sitting on his chair
71-1_1561.7_4.32.wav_ASR	so he's obviously really upset about this because he could have been heard
71-1_1566.34_1.16.wav_ASR	and the glass is broken
71-1_1568.22_1.04.wav_ASR	and it's in his yard
71-1_1569.74_1.088.wav_ASR	and it should have happened
71-1_1571.64_7.02.wav_ASR	and so he grabs the chair looks out the window to find the coach who did this to him
71-1_1578.75_3.64.wav_ASR	well they're going to be some kind of
71-1_1582.51_3.18.wav_ASR	he's gonna need some kind of restoration that they're made and a pumpkin
71-1_1585.938_20.64.wav_ASR	he looks like he's about ready to head over grab the boy and hit over the window
71-1_1623.92_0.5.wav_ASR	okay
71-1_1624.855_4.46.wav_ASR	well it looks as if this little
71-1_1630.595_1.88.wav_ASR	let's see
71-1_1632.686_1.727.wav_ASR	alright actually it could be kind of
71-1_1635.675_3.5.wav_ASR	can't decide if it's male or female
71-1_1639.515_3.031.wav_ASR	it's a little bit weird
71-1_1643.288_9.44.wav_ASR	they's getting ready to head out to the library somewhere somewhere
71-1_1653.76_5.85.wav_ASR	and their mother looked outside and said
71-1_1660.248_1.642.wav_ASR	you know i think we're gonna see some rain
71-1_1662.48_1.17.wav_ASR	you might need the umbrella
71-1_1664.82_1.11.wav_ASR	but this child says
71-1_1666.34_1.55.wav_ASR	you don't need an umbrella
71-1_1668.44_1.2.wav_ASR	mean this is ridiculous
71-1_1669.94_0.6.wav_ASR	it's not gonna rain
71-1_1670.78_1.68.wav_ASR	and i don't really care about getting wet
71-1_1672.82_0.87.wav_ASR	you know i don't
71-1_1674.76_0.73.wav_ASR	well i'm not sure
71-1_1675.74_1.68.wav_ASR	and i don't mail when the water hits
71-1_1678.28_1.97.wav_ASR	so this this child
71-1_1680.78_0.88.wav_ASR	one i'm leaving anyway
71-1_1681.66_1.72.wav_ASR	hey it's firstnamec
71-1_1683.529_1.775.wav_ASR	it immediately began to rain
71-1_1686.38_1.31.wav_ASR	all of a sudden
71-1_1688.02_4.78.wav_ASR	hey i'm getting rain drops in my eye
71-1_1693.33_1.4.wav_ASR	and i'm getting really wet
71-1_1695.36_1.22.wav_ASR	but this is not
71-1_1697.22_2.14.wav_ASR	and i didn't understand that it was getting in my eye
71-1_1700.24_4.96.wav_ASR	so i immediately hit it back because it was raining much harder than i thought it was
71-1_1706.08_0.654.wav_ASR	walk in
71-1_1706.84_0.896.wav_ASR	slip the umbrella
71-1_1708.14_1.485.wav_ASR	just looked at her
71-1_1710.54_2.22.wav_ASR	and she of course knew that i was right
71-1_1713.18_11.1.wav_ASR	the mother immediately understood that while it was very difficult for this child to ask for it or to acknowledge that they were wrong
71-1_1725.08_5.08.wav_ASR	they did make clear that they didn't need need an umbrella if they were gonna be walking to the lake
71-1_1730.64_3.56.wav_ASR	so the mother then gave them the umbrella
71-1_1734.68_10.14.wav_ASR	and they went back on their way with an umbrella remembering at this point that maybe mother's actually know what they're talking about with their sister
71-1_1761.65_0.5.wav_ASR	yeah
71-1_1762.547_29.94.wav_ASR	well what happened is that the cat that belongs to the little girl runs up in a tree and become to me how make make clear that it did want to get off the tree but no longer knew how to get back from the branch that
71-1_1800.778_0.579.wav_ASR	help me
71-1_1802.158_0.382.wav_ASR	me
71-1_1802.54_6.1.wav_ASR	and the little girl is obviously just really embarrassing about the situation of her cat
71-1_1808.838_1.772.wav_ASR	he's very worried about getting her cat out
71-1_1811.358_5.082.wav_ASR	so she began by going to her father and saying
71-1_1816.78_4.1.wav_ASR	can you please help me get the cat out of the tree
71-1_1820.94_4.437.wav_ASR	and the ball
71-1_1825.6_0.417.wav_ASR	poor
71-1_1826.1_18.22.wav_ASR	and he grabbed his ladder and put it against the tree and climbed up to the the the the limb where the cat was because those branches are too far
71-1_1845.67_8.6.wav_ASR	he also incidentally kicked off the ladder which then puts him back in the situation that he needsta be rescued
71-1_1855.03_5.868.wav_ASR	so at this point the dog is now barking because the dog wants the father to get out of the tree
71-1_1861.6_10.368.wav_ASR	the barking of the dog is making it more difficult for the cat to be able to inch it way back down to the trunk
71-1_1872.9_8.052.wav_ASR	so the little girl is still really stressed because her child her cat is
71-1_1880.952_2.68.wav_ASR	that's a magnificent pair of glass slippers
71-1_1883.772_0.899.wav_ASR	make that all the time
71-1_1885.192_3.057.wav_ASR	is really wants her cat to be able to get out
71-1_1888.249_17.88.wav_ASR	so they call the fire department to come down and not just rescue the cat but also rescue the cat as he now needs also be rescued since his attempt at putting the ladder against the tree wasn't helpful
71-1_1906.179_13.419.wav_ASR	but it it does actually shows that the father was really trying to do whatever his daughter wanted him to do in terms of helping the cat
71-1_1939.75_0.39.wav_ASR	shiver
71-1_2104.158_2.744.wav_ASR	oh keep the family intact
71-1_2107.478_3.16.wav_ASR	but i'll be next time around
71-1_2113.118_0.492.wav_ASR	it
71-1_2113.85_8.89.wav_ASR	and cinderella is she's the daughter of a
71-1_2123.66_2.76.wav_ASR	her mother has been killed
71-1_2127.23_2.66.wav_ASR	and so the two of them are
71-1_2131.04_13.9.wav_ASR	and the her father decides that it would be really helpful for his daughter if he could provide a mother for her daughter cinderella
71-1_2146.02_1.74.wav_ASR	so he met this
71-1_2149.12_2.03.wav_ASR	and i don't know that we've ever heard her name
71-1_2151.74_3.0.wav_ASR	but anyway other way's knee
71-1_2155.58_6.48.wav_ASR	maid very clear that she would be a wonderful mother to cinderella
71-1_2162.44_1.851.wav_ASR	and she also had two daughters of her own
71-1_2165.48_1.34.wav_ASR	oh they
71-1_2167.42_10.34.wav_ASR	and unfortunately the way that cinderella was treated was not appropriate
71-1_2178.36_5.417.wav_ASR	three she was not treated the same way that the stepmother's daughters were treated
71-1_2183.777_4.48.wav_ASR	and and in step she was used as as a maid
71-1_2188.336_5.469.wav_ASR	and i have no idea whether her father is in this whole picture and why he's not doing anything about this
71-1_2194.037_3.593.wav_ASR	but maybe he's traveling or whatever
71-1_2197.83_17.72.wav_ASR	but he's left the mansion of his daughter to the stepmother who treats her very badly doesn't treat her the same and has given the mess to her daughters that it is fine to treat cinderella
71-1_2216.67_10.5.wav_ASR	so she effectively becomes the maid to these two stepsisters and to a stepmother
71-1_2228.39_5.92.wav_ASR	but she's very very sweet young woman
71-1_2235.23_16.92.wav_ASR	and she's found a way to also have happy and stable relationships with the animals because that's one of her jobs as a maid is to make sure the animals are fed
71-1_2252.39_1.84.wav_ASR	so she sings
71-1_2255.14_0.93.wav_ASR	they love her
71-1_2256.32_5.39.wav_ASR	and she's close to the the the horses the other animals
71-1_2262.1_9.26.wav_ASR	and she dreams about being in a better situation where she's loved and is treated with more respect than she is
71-1_2271.67_11.59.wav_ASR	well she's so quick busy which is certainly one of the reasons why the stepsisters are so mean to her because they
71-1_2284.39_18.53.wav_ASR	but while this is going on in this house the king of the kingdom has made it clear to his son that it's time for him to marry because the king would like to retire
71-1_2303.08_7.52.wav_ASR	and he liked to hand down the king to his son
71-1_2311.32_1.88.wav_ASR	but first his son has to marry
71-1_2313.84_2.509.wav_ASR	and he doesn't really want it
71-1_2316.62_1.587.wav_ASR	he's not interested in anything
71-1_2318.34_1.38.wav_ASR	he's not dating anymore
71-1_2320.22_3.01.wav_ASR	but the plan is that this is his shoe
71-1_2324.16_3.094.wav_ASR	it was kind of like the prince harry of that time
71-1_2327.3_3.0.wav_ASR	the scare and not well
71-1_2331.06_5.74.wav_ASR	but in any case the plan is that there's gonna be a dance
71-1_2336.832_13.545.wav_ASR	and all of the evil which i guess means that child being sposta show up at this dance so that he can pick the one that he wants
71-1_2350.732_4.303.wav_ASR	and again we will not get into the finance quote of how this all worked
71-1_2356.58_2.034.wav_ASR	unfortunately the word gets out
71-1_2359.36_6.948.wav_ASR	the two stepsisters are just really excited about this idea because they're the right age
71-1_2366.94_9.235.wav_ASR	because their mother had married cinderella's father who makes a fair money they can dress really well
71-1_2376.175_11.163.wav_ASR	well they can really get dressed up to go to this dance and see if they could be the one that would attract the the attention of the prince
71-1_2388.615_1.676.wav_ASR	the cinderella wants to go
71-1_2390.815_3.322.wav_ASR	she also reads about this that that is coming
71-1_2394.137_3.18.wav_ASR	and then she knows she's eligible because she's the right age
71-1_2397.537_6.18.wav_ASR	and i guess she's of that nationality or whatever type they're used
71-1_2404.5_6.33.wav_ASR	but her stepmother kinda makes clear that no she's she's not invited to go
71-1_2411.78_5.16.wav_ASR	he's not gonna be able to go to stores and buy clothes the way that her
71-1_2417.82_2.25.wav_ASR	so she tries to make something on her own
71-1_2420.4_3.38.wav_ASR	and she tries to take the merchandise and the ragets that are related to it
71-1_2424.24_4.62.wav_ASR	he looks looks up how to make them in a
71-1_2429.36_1.08.wav_ASR	it was on page eleven
71-1_2430.56_1.38.wav_ASR	that's what was happening on
71-1_2432.61_1.33.wav_ASR	and she comes up with the dress
71-1_2434.24_1.5.wav_ASR	and of course she looks amazing
71-1_2436.71_9.244.wav_ASR	guess we were pretty and pink the film with a million ringo ringo ringo ringo ringo ringo ringo ringo ringo ringo ringo ringo ringo ringo ringo ringo ringo ringo ringo ringo ringo ringo ringo ringo ringo ringo ringo ringo ringo ringo ringo ringo ringo ringo ringo ringo ringo ringo ringo ringo ringo ringo ringo ringo ringo ringo ringo
71-1_2446.2_1.78.wav_ASR	but this is not
71-1_2449.65_1.12.wav_ASR	and this is cinderella
71-1_2450.992_2.458.wav_ASR	so her mother laughs at her and says
71-1_2453.57_1.49.wav_ASR	we're not going out with those clothes
71-1_2455.45_2.61.wav_ASR	and her stepsisters knock her
71-1_2458.95_2.32.wav_ASR	and she's out in the barn by herself
71-1_2462.19_9.66.wav_ASR	and all the sudden this fairy godmother shows up based on one of her wishes
71-1_2472.03_2.42.wav_ASR	but i wish i could go to the ball
71-1_2475.65_12.128.wav_ASR	and she the reason that the fairy fairy godmother is showing up is because she knows that cinderella is a really sweet young girl
71-1_2488.53_2.041.wav_ASR	and she cares about everybody
71-1_2490.87_1.674.wav_ASR	and she does things for everybody else
71-1_2492.544_4.96.wav_ASR	and because of the period of her hard she desires this chance
71-1_2498.584_2.36.wav_ASR	so she uses her magical powers
71-1_2502.18_6.324.wav_ASR	and she not only creates a dress for her that is incredibly ornate
71-1_2509.124_2.72.wav_ASR	you can go to the
71-1_2511.9_14.753.wav_ASR	but she also trains the mice into horses and the pumpkin into carriage to be able to take her so that she can get there
71-1_2526.84_2.1.wav_ASR	and she could ride in style
71-1_2529.78_4.64.wav_ASR	so cinderella is very very happy hugs her
71-1_2534.78_0.88.wav_ASR	and her grandmother's saying
71-1_2535.86_5.98.wav_ASR	remember this only will last until midnight
71-1_2542.26_4.463.wav_ASR	at midnight your dress will go back to your rag
71-1_2546.723_5.94.wav_ASR	your horses will be trained back into
71-1_2554.163_6.318.wav_ASR	and the coach will be or the carriage will be transported back into a pumpkin
71-1_2561.13_0.573.wav_ASR	and she said
71-1_2561.943_0.442.wav_ASR	so i know
71-1_2562.423_0.792.wav_ASR	thank you very much
71-1_2563.463_3.157.wav_ASR	so she meets the the
71-1_2567.38_17.24.wav_ASR	and of course because she is so elegant attire and shows up with this really really pretty of carriage she's treated as royal her
71-1_2584.975_2.916.wav_ASR	the the put man opens the door
71-1_2588.095_0.812.wav_ASR	help her
71-1_2589.635_0.812.wav_ASR	he walks in there
71-1_2590.635_2.32.wav_ASR	immediately the prince just like
71-1_2593.435_0.658.wav_ASR	slip that
71-1_2594.515_2.3.wav_ASR	it's like he's been stuck by life
71-1_2597.575_1.165.wav_ASR	he's the one i wanna be
71-1_2598.975_1.165.wav_ASR	he he hits the window
71-1_2600.475_2.06.wav_ASR	there's an interesting
71-1_2604.46_2.0.wav_ASR	he dances with her the entire night
71-1_2606.82_5.16.wav_ASR	he's pretty clear that maybe at this point in the whole thing in the whole if i get to be with this one
71-1_2613.19_4.0.wav_ASR	and and all the sudden at this point she's pulling away
71-1_2617.56_0.34.wav_ASR	and she said
71-1_2618.12_0.46.wav_ASR	and i got a
71-1_2618.76_0.34.wav_ASR	and he's like
71-1_2619.22_1.32.wav_ASR	you know stick around
71-1_2620.94_0.6.wav_ASR	you've got food
71-1_2622.58_0.6.wav_ASR	and they say
71-1_2624.18_1.12.wav_ASR	and she said
71-1_2625.6_0.71.wav_ASR	oh i gotta get back
71-1_2626.5_0.52.wav_ASR	we gotta go
71-1_2627.3_5.8.wav_ASR	and she runs away at about two or three or four minutes to midnight because her she's
71-1_2633.26_1.166.wav_ASR	oh i i've got this curse
71-1_2634.56_0.786.wav_ASR	and i got to go away
71-1_2635.38_1.167.wav_ASR	and she races away
71-1_2637.7_2.81.wav_ASR	all of a sudden she's she's a really fast
71-1_2640.94_0.44.wav_ASR	so she's all
71-1_2641.38_4.57.wav_ASR	way but all the time he sees that one of her shoes has been left there
71-1_2646.16_0.98.wav_ASR	glass slipper
71-1_2647.86_2.174.wav_ASR	and so he picks that up
71-1_2650.2_3.24.wav_ASR	it's all he's got of her is this glass slipper
71-1_2654.1_2.56.wav_ASR	so he goes back to his father and says
71-1_2657.28_1.28.wav_ASR	hey i'll marry somebody
71-1_2658.86_1.868.wav_ASR	there's only one woman i wanna marry
71-1_2660.728_1.516.wav_ASR	and she's the one i wanna marry
71-1_2662.968_4.68.wav_ASR	and all i have is this clue that her foot will fit into this shoe
71-1_2668.928_2.54.wav_ASR	they're starting arriving around the kingdom
71-1_2672.608_7.36.wav_ASR	one that can who's feet will fit into these slippers the prince will see you as a queen
71-1_2680.85_7.16.wav_ASR	so oh oh the stepsisters who you know they were annoyed at the ball
71-1_2688.27_2.82.wav_ASR	but they pretty sure they get their feet into this slipper
71-1_2692.05_1.6.wav_ASR	he one of the kitten
71-1_2694.54_19.21.wav_ASR	so he's and and of course at this point cinderella's back doing her work taking care of the animals cleaning in the kitchen once again just distressed and annoyed and motioned to create specifically by her family
71-1_2714.59_1.81.wav_ASR	so the prince starts driving around
71-1_2716.91_4.25.wav_ASR	it's it's really difficult sort of thing that he's driving
71-1_2721.43_10.724.wav_ASR	people are running out taking off their shoes and seeing if their feet will fit into this slipper which is apparently designed to fit this one single one
71-1_2733.67_1.9.wav_ASR	and he hops up and he stops at their house
71-1_2735.77_6.34.wav_ASR	he's really depressed at this point because he hasn't found a woman who's fit will fit in to that slipper
71-1_2743.01_1.095.wav_ASR	he stops at this house
71-1_2744.37_2.793.wav_ASR	all of the stepsisters do everything they can
71-1_2747.29_3.08.wav_ASR	but they're feet are just too big or too long or
71-1_2750.71_0.798.wav_ASR	it's not work
71-1_2751.632_3.22.wav_ASR	and then all the sudden
71-1_2755.261_2.278.wav_ASR	he's just about ready to leave
71-1_2757.592_1.74.wav_ASR	all the time he sees a movie
71-1_2760.172_5.59.wav_ASR	and he sees this other woman like the maid who's just in the corner
71-1_2766.572_0.428.wav_ASR	and he said
71-1_2767.252_0.588.wav_ASR	don't hurry
71-1_2768.83_1.36.wav_ASR	and the stepmother said
71-1_2770.312_0.798.wav_ASR	oh she's not
71-1_2771.5_0.97.wav_ASR	two she's our maid
71-1_2773.43_1.84.wav_ASR	and she looks up
71-1_2775.92_5.43.wav_ASR	the prince just has this strange feeling about her
71-1_2781.92_1.44.wav_ASR	hadta have her come out
71-1_2783.78_7.311.wav_ASR	and i'd like to see if her feet will if the slippers will fit her feet
71-1_2791.091_2.035.wav_ASR	and so she comes in
71-1_2793.371_0.92.wav_ASR	he's a master
71-1_2794.711_3.639.wav_ASR	you know she's been working in the kitchen and in the
71-1_2798.931_6.2.wav_ASR	and she's you know not not looking anywhere like the princess person that had been at the
71-1_2805.87_0.8.wav_ASR	but she came out
71-1_2806.831_0.759.wav_ASR	and she sat down
71-1_2808.51_3.56.wav_ASR	the prince put the slipper on her foot
71-1_2812.99_1.08.wav_ASR	and it fit
71-1_2814.73_0.98.wav_ASR	and then he looked at her
71-1_2815.71_22.48.wav_ASR	what is remarkable is that he was able to look beyond all of the palace of the the will that she had shown the first time he met her to see that it was exactly the same person even if she was clear not of the same state that he had assumed
71-1_2839.43_15.337.wav_ASR	so they happily they lived happily after until just the cinderella did not like the cinderella because she was not fine enough stuff
71-1_2854.767_18.19.wav_ASR	he hadta return his crown and go to another conference and and then start right putting feet feet feet feet fits fits fits fits
71-1_2872.957_0.84.wav_ASR	alright
71-1_2874.864_1.272.wav_ASR	oh yeah yeah
71-1_2900.37_0.5.wav_ASR	okay
71-1_2905.61_1.0.wav_ASR	oh
71-1_2910.67_11.58.wav_ASR	an interesting interesting thing about clocks to me recently is that i went to a physical check
71-1_2923.03_2.831.wav_ASR	and i'd just turn fifty five
71-1_2926.39_2.52.wav_ASR	so i had never experienced this before
71-1_2929.05_5.28.wav_ASR	but i thought it was my annual physical
71-1_2935.52_1.03.wav_ASR	well i walk a lot
71-1_2936.75_0.57.wav_ASR	and i sat down
71-1_2937.65_2.34.wav_ASR	the nurse is checking my blood pressure
71-1_2940.41_4.62.wav_ASR	and she's checking you know the my heart rate my pulse and all the other other stuff
71-1_2945.73_3.06.wav_ASR	and then she handed me a piece of paper and a pen and said
71-1_2948.98_1.34.wav_ASR	and i like you to draw a clock
71-1_2951.06_1.01.wav_ASR	you're you're
71-1_2953.58_0.57.wav_ASR	and she said
71-1_2954.34_3.38.wav_ASR	because i i wanna see what kind of picture you you can draw
71-1_2958.32_2.76.wav_ASR	so it seems ridiculous
71-1_2961.62_1.027.wav_ASR	but i did it anyway
71-1_2963.0_0.93.wav_ASR	oh i just
71-1_2964.52_9.32.wav_ASR	and i knew how to handle what to draw picture probably with a clock which is you first you put down the twelve
71-1_2974.0_0.89.wav_ASR	and then you put down the sandwich
71-1_2975.14_0.66.wav_ASR	and you put the two
71-1_2975.98_0.71.wav_ASR	they put the knife
71-1_2976.74_8.82.wav_ASR	and then you fill the number so that everything is okay where it should be instead of you know having them too crowded
71-1_2986.12_3.09.wav_ASR	and then i hadta draw the pictures of two forty five
71-1_2990.32_1.08.wav_ASR	and i finished
71-1_2991.6_0.4.wav_ASR	and i said
71-1_2992.42_1.46.wav_ASR	oh it's this what you want
71-1_2994.75_4.17.wav_ASR	or did you wanna just look at what you have on the wall that's right there which is a
71-1_2999.82_0.95.wav_ASR	and she said
71-1_3001.11_2.02.wav_ASR	well you have passed this type
71-1_3003.49_0.32.wav_ASR	and she says
71-1_3004.28_1.87.wav_ASR	it was recently a dementia test
71-1_3006.254_13.939.wav_ASR	oh that when you're sixty five and you go in for a funeral for a annual check you will hafta draw a clock
71-1_3020.834_0.477.wav_ASR	and i said
71-1_3021.514_2.193.wav_ASR	one point will they stop doing this
71-1_3023.76_9.43.wav_ASR	because while i did indeed grow up with the you know the round sock right use it
71-1_3033.8_1.68.wav_ASR	everything i do is disgusting
71-1_3035.807_16.95.wav_ASR	so what happens at what january will they decide that this is not the way to show that you do not have dementia or whatever and that you simply have a different understanding of of what time it is
71-1_3053.5_2.36.wav_ASR	so anyway if i do it i'm not gonna do it again
71-1_3056.16_6.11.wav_ASR	maybe just mess with them and just put down some different stuff and see what they do
71-1_3062.88_3.78.wav_ASR	you have my p t a or something like bruise
71-1_3066.9_2.818.wav_ASR	but anyway it's it's a test that they do
71-1_3069.718_3.888.wav_ASR	and i found it really irritating though i pass
71-1_3074.018_3.915.wav_ASR	the it's it's gonna be awful very very quick
71-1_3078.438_1.048.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
71-1_3084.638_1.963.wav_ASR	oh let me see
71-1_3091.487_18.88.wav_ASR	one of the things i useta do when my daughter was younger is every january usually the first week and january we would head together to watch the evil wife
71-1_3110.83_14.71.wav_ASR	and what the evil wife was is worse of here on the way somewhere the evil's are on the way somewhere else
71-1_3125.67_0.72.wav_ASR	they're coming back
71-1_3126.63_1.247.wav_ASR	they're going south or something
71-1_3127.877_5.666.wav_ASR	but they all show up in this lake for about three or four days
71-1_3134.157_8.44.wav_ASR	and so what people do is they have groups the odyssey surprise and other groups that show up with
71-1_3144.23_4.65.wav_ASR	and we watch the the the eggs because you can see it
71-1_3149.19_1.113.wav_ASR	they're really really close
71-1_3150.45_1.46.wav_ASR	you can see the
71-1_3152.49_1.454.wav_ASR	and you can see them with their mother
71-1_3154.33_2.28.wav_ASR	and there's just so many of them at one time
71-1_3157.17_2.038.wav_ASR	in washington we have a lot of hot
71-1_3159.43_4.8.wav_ASR	but we don't necessarily see ball the eggs as much
71-1_3164.36_1.23.wav_ASR	it's much more rare
71-1_3166.48_4.788.wav_ASR	that's something that we did for a number of years
71-1_3171.36_2.94.wav_ASR	even when she was thirteen and wasn't really talking to him anymore
71-1_3174.98_2.763.wav_ASR	we always had fun on that day
71-1_3177.96_0.725.wav_ASR	they were sure
71-1_3179.02_3.122.wav_ASR	the first she dresses really really warm because it's gonna be twenty below
71-1_3182.59_3.58.wav_ASR	we would go to the bank with firstnameb
71-1_3186.63_2.08.wav_ASR	we would wait for the evil to show
71-1_3188.91_1.44.wav_ASR	we would watch them for a while
71-1_3190.65_2.38.wav_ASR	and we would go have hot coffee
71-1_3193.31_2.86.wav_ASR	and she will talk and doing that time
71-1_3196.61_2.19.wav_ASR	when we were home then it was
71-1_3199.11_0.88.wav_ASR	oh she's my
71-1_3200.21_0.568.wav_ASR	oh not tape
71-1_3200.778_1.896.wav_ASR	don't talk to my friends
71-1_3202.738_13.726.wav_ASR	but it was always that one period even in those very very difficult early years that my always talk to me after we watched the eggs
71-1_3216.464_5.16.wav_ASR	so that's one of the things that i would think of when i think of the word bird
71-1_3227.38_1.01.wav_ASR	what was the word again
71-1_3230.244_2.56.wav_ASR	oh i don't know if you wanna hear that story
71-1_3233.039_0.485.wav_ASR	oh
71-1_3233.991_2.78.wav_ASR	well i okay
71-1_3236.777_13.094.wav_ASR	and i can tell you a a recent one that will clearly not be ready or or because really when you start getting it that way it could be way more interesting
71-1_3250.021_10.775.wav_ASR	well talk about something i did last summer just since my stroke i've been trying to push myself a little bit
71-1_3260.881_2.569.wav_ASR	again i'm i'm much more tired than i used to be
71-1_3263.61_5.251.wav_ASR	but i'm still trying to push my boundaries to find out exactly what's possible
71-1_3268.93_1.28.wav_ASR	oh and how much can i do
71-1_3270.29_1.827.wav_ASR	and how long can i drive
71-1_3272.13_3.6.wav_ASR	and how many hours a day can i you know be active
71-1_3275.741_2.789.wav_ASR	and so i work with this nonprofit
71-1_3279.53_5.7.wav_ASR	and we were having a event in northern wisconsin off the miami river
71-1_3285.397_2.48.wav_ASR	it's a our group is called wake
71-1_3289.337_1.68.wav_ASR	we do with firstnamea firstnames
71-1_3291.677_3.779.wav_ASR	so i i head up for this week's event
71-1_3295.737_1.06.wav_ASR	and i hadta get up
71-1_3296.957_5.26.wav_ASR	think i left town at five to get up there by eight
71-1_3302.331_5.519.wav_ASR	we had a event all day long and talking and you know different things going on
71-1_3307.891_1.32.wav_ASR	it was really really hot
71-1_3310.051_3.538.wav_ASR	and i was ready to drive home by five o'clock
71-1_3314.151_2.269.wav_ASR	about an hour on the
71-1_3317.011_2.559.wav_ASR	but it's about three and a half hours of travel
71-1_3319.71_2.98.wav_ASR	but i decided i can't drive anymore
71-1_3323.47_1.68.wav_ASR	my head was just
71-1_3326.15_3.68.wav_ASR	and i needed to sleep really really
71-1_3329.87_2.42.wav_ASR	and i learned to listen to myself
71-1_3332.61_4.86.wav_ASR	my body says you're tired you pull over and you rest
71-1_3337.649_5.112.wav_ASR	you don't just look around drink some coffee and you keep on going
71-1_3343.27_1.34.wav_ASR	so i pulled into this hotel
71-1_3345.85_1.66.wav_ASR	it if lucky i found them
71-1_3347.849_3.041.wav_ASR	you know i didn't have a reservation or anything
71-1_3351.11_9.614.wav_ASR	and i was just looking for a place that had an opening so i could go in and get out of the sun and you know cover my eyes and not hafta drive anymore
71-1_3360.85_10.96.wav_ASR	but because i was as tired as i was and because i was pushed to my boundaries my aphasia had clearly flared
71-1_3372.95_2.18.wav_ASR	so i walked in this house
71-1_3375.69_3.36.wav_ASR	and i mean clearly they were a lot of bankruptcy
71-1_3379.64_2.57.wav_ASR	well actually i didn't know that already
71-1_3382.66_1.98.wav_ASR	but i thought it said baltimore
71-1_3385.14_0.809.wav_ASR	but i wasn't sure
71-1_3386.18_0.937.wav_ASR	and i walk in the door
71-1_3388.0_2.42.wav_ASR	and there's this woman behind the the desk
71-1_3390.82_0.48.wav_ASR	and i said
71-1_3391.54_2.24.wav_ASR	you know i'm here for a room
71-1_3394.62_0.32.wav_ASR	and i said
71-1_3395.02_1.08.wav_ASR	do you have any vacation
71-1_3397.62_5.68.wav_ASR	and and of course that's what happens with aphasia is you say word
71-1_3403.92_3.86.wav_ASR	and no vacation was could have been a problem
71-1_3408.16_3.161.wav_ASR	people are wearing masks
71-1_3411.64_1.783.wav_ASR	and they're being very careful about that
71-1_3413.72_2.58.wav_ASR	but so of course i was trying to say
71-1_3416.34_1.56.wav_ASR	did you have a
71-1_3418.62_1.778.wav_ASR	umbrella umbrella
71-1_3420.7_1.02.wav_ASR	you have a vacation
71-1_3422.16_3.26.wav_ASR	and she went into her coach
71-1_3426.26_1.62.wav_ASR	everybody here's been back home
71-1_3428.38_0.711.wav_ASR	you all are mad
71-1_3429.38_0.988.wav_ASR	wife everything down
71-1_3430.72_0.54.wav_ASR	and i'm just saying
71-1_3431.88_0.98.wav_ASR	so you have a room
71-1_3433.14_0.664.wav_ASR	and she said
71-1_3433.92_1.033.wav_ASR	yes yes yes yeah
71-1_3435.16_0.545.wav_ASR	don't worry
71-1_3435.705_1.0.wav_ASR	we we followed cops
71-1_3436.845_0.623.wav_ASR	don't worry
71-1_3437.565_1.797.wav_ASR	you're not gonna get it here
71-1_3439.805_1.863.wav_ASR	and she gave me a umbrella
71-1_3441.825_6.66.wav_ASR	really that was one way to cover things up is you just go with it you know
71-1_3448.76_1.911.wav_ASR	if she had a vacation
71-1_3451.44_0.31.wav_ASR	and i said
71-1_3452.165_0.98.wav_ASR	you have a bag
71-1_3453.98_1.77.wav_ASR	and so we just went with back and forth
71-1_3456.24_2.03.wav_ASR	and then finally i worked my way back to
71-1_3459.14_2.56.wav_ASR	you have an empty room that i can sleep in
71-1_3462.68_5.02.wav_ASR	so i got in the room went in and drank a lot of water and literally slept for twelve hours
71-1_3468.94_0.48.wav_ASR	yeah
71-1_3471.54_2.08.wav_ASR	so that's that's another story
71-1_3478.5_0.5.wav_ASR	okay
71-1_3480.14_0.8.wav_ASR	the
71-1_3481.62_20.94.wav_ASR	oh i guess if i were going to choose something to talk about restaurant i would talk about how i paid my way through my undergraduate which is through
71-1_3504.63_14.68.wav_ASR	and i waste behind at at kind of a little coffee shop that was near where i lived because i had no car
71-1_3520.12_1.31.wav_ASR	and i could just bike there
71-1_3522.42_1.45.wav_ASR	and they were very very kind
71-1_3524.03_2.94.wav_ASR	and i did the breakfast
71-1_3528.1_14.32.wav_ASR	but i learned very quickly after about six months that you would get paid ten to fifteen percent as a tip based upon the the prices of the restaurants
71-1_3543.14_8.24.wav_ASR	well what made sense was to find the restaurant that was the most expensive and turns out in price
71-1_3552.167_3.873.wav_ASR	doing the exactly same part of service
71-1_3556.39_19.218.wav_ASR	if they're only playing five days for their meal and their having you fifty cents that's not gonna be near as good as if they spent twenty dollars for their meal
71-1_3575.98_5.36.wav_ASR	so what i learned to do is keep going to more and more and more and more and more and more
71-1_3582.46_20.82.wav_ASR	and i mean the the the maybe untold story is the the the the the the really you know high
71-1_3604.84_2.74.wav_ASR	so that's what i ended up doing
71-1_3608.2_4.664.wav_ASR	but but again it what was so interesting to me as that i worked just as hard
71-1_3613.32_4.157.wav_ASR	and i use the same sort of you know
71-1_3618.84_5.61.wav_ASR	you hafta sort of keep a revolving list of tasks that you do in the middle of doing
71-1_3624.45_1.994.wav_ASR	well you're going to the bar to get drunk
71-1_3626.65_1.508.wav_ASR	are you going here to get your food
71-1_3628.39_1.405.wav_ASR	you're gonna go pee more water
71-1_3630.11_0.946.wav_ASR	you're gonna give me your check
71-1_3631.51_5.578.wav_ASR	you hafta keep them all kind of violating all at one time
71-1_3637.31_4.757.wav_ASR	trying to decide exactly how you're going to prioritize each of those tasks
71-1_3642.067_10.0.wav_ASR	it's it's really i mean being wasting being a waste of energy is a really mentally challenging
71-1_3653.687_3.66.wav_ASR	it's just bizarre that they don't pay people any money to do that
71-1_3657.49_4.33.wav_ASR	but i was lucky because i made enough money that i was still able to graduate
71-1_3662.01_8.22.wav_ASR	and i wasn't paying the degree of the amount of money that grants and universities are paying now which is out
71-1_3672.05_0.61.wav_ASR	what's the word
71-1_3673.93_2.38.wav_ASR	yeah it's for my umbrella
71-1_3676.61_1.701.wav_ASR	the graduate school that was very different
71-1_3678.311_5.3.wav_ASR	but yeah i had no student loans because i worked as a waitress in restaurant
71-1_3698.06_0.59.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
71-1_3699.03_2.999.wav_ASR	and it's it's really mentally kind of like
71-1_3703.14_1.235.wav_ASR	you know three minutes
71-1_3704.68_0.709.wav_ASR	and i can go get that
71-1_3705.62_0.591.wav_ASR	alright go ahead
71-1_3706.54_0.366.wav_ASR	oh
71-1_3707.62_2.536.wav_ASR	it's it's kind of a challenge
71-1_3710.2_0.816.wav_ASR	it's kinda fun
71-1_3713.34_0.455.wav_ASR	yeah
71-1_3718.76_0.845.wav_ASR	you can kind of see it
71-1_3719.76_0.59.wav_ASR	and they eat
71-1_3720.7_1.28.wav_ASR	you need more coffee over there
71-1_3722.26_0.96.wav_ASR	you got this going on
71-1_3723.52_4.32.wav_ASR	and i will say that the second place i worked i carry it
71-1_3728.62_8.414.wav_ASR	and when i went to get a physical they were trying to figure out why this muscle on this arm was stronger than this one
71-1_3738.16_0.74.wav_ASR	they're something going on
71-1_3739.09_0.75.wav_ASR	they're growing grow
71-1_3739.97_0.49.wav_ASR	and i said
71-1_3740.68_1.82.wav_ASR	and i'm just really really strong
71-1_3743.1_1.92.wav_ASR	yeah
71-1_3753.971_14.825.wav_ASR	well if i were going to make peanut butter and jelly sandwich i would be begin by pulling out the bread
71-1_3769.311_2.802.wav_ASR	and taking out two slices of bread
71-1_3772.113_2.019.wav_ASR	and and laying them on the table
71-1_3774.633_8.24.wav_ASR	when i would go and get the jar of jelly and the jar of peanut butter
71-1_3783.713_4.173.wav_ASR	and i would bring probably a spoon and a knife with me
71-1_3788.57_2.863.wav_ASR	and i would begin with the peanut butter peanut
71-1_3792.068_2.272.wav_ASR	it's really difficult where to say it
71-1_3794.488_0.84.wav_ASR	peanut butter
71-1_3796.268_4.045.wav_ASR	and i would spread that on the one side of the bread
71-1_3800.828_3.96.wav_ASR	the other piece of bread i would put on
71-1_3805.108_1.06.wav_ASR	we'd use a spoon
71-1_3806.568_1.011.wav_ASR	and i would pull off the jacket
71-1_3807.92_4.373.wav_ASR	and i would spread that evenly on that piece of bread
71-1_3812.7_2.72.wav_ASR	then i would close the two of them together
71-1_3816.12_6.32.wav_ASR	and i would close screw the tops back on the jelly and the peanut butter
71-1_3822.66_0.63.wav_ASR	put them away
71-1_3823.88_1.4.wav_ASR	and then i would eat my sandwich
71-1_3832.11_5.6.wav_ASR	well i don't do it often
71-1_3838.45_1.708.wav_ASR	you're not sposta
71-1_3840.85_15.069.wav_ASR	when i do my laundry decide the fact that i do have washing machine down there i tend to go to the laundry mat because i can do all of it at one time
71-1_3856.37_2.654.wav_ASR	and i only wanna do it once in a week or every other week
71-1_3859.024_4.476.wav_ASR	because it's just something i find kind of boring to do
71-1_3863.904_3.04.wav_ASR	what i do is
71-1_3868.044_1.74.wav_ASR	if i hafta do this tomorrow
71-1_3870.184_1.23.wav_ASR	so let me think about this
71-1_3871.644_3.54.wav_ASR	oh all of my dirty clothes
71-1_3875.33_5.584.wav_ASR	and i usually use the smartphone to find out whether they go into the hospital or not
71-1_3880.914_18.7.wav_ASR	when i decide that everything needs to be washed which also will clean the walls the washcloths and the other towels hang clothes the washcloths and the other towels hang off in the kitchen i would all of them in
71-1_3900.01_5.52.wav_ASR	useta use a computer of log log
71-1_3907.24_0.66.wav_ASR	and i would put that
71-1_3908.31_4.39.wav_ASR	we'd carry it to the back side of my the back seat of my car
71-1_3913.6_8.52.wav_ASR	would make sure i had quarters or had cash that i could use for the quarter machine in the laundry room
71-1_3923.11_1.57.wav_ASR	we would go to the laundromat
71-1_3924.88_6.327.wav_ASR	the largest machine that was able that i could do all of my laundry at one time in one machine
71-1_3931.207_5.18.wav_ASR	but i would put the laundry in
71-1_3937.23_12.357.wav_ASR	if they didn't all fit i would make sure that the clothing that could be washed at a higher lower temperature would go into a separate smaller washing machine
71-1_3950.36_1.814.wav_ASR	make sure the soap was in
71-1_3952.46_2.068.wav_ASR	make sure i had enough course
71-1_3955.36_6.792.wav_ASR	and then i would probably go by food or something they're being washed
71-1_3962.36_0.924.wav_ASR	come back
71-1_3963.54_1.44.wav_ASR	they're in the tree
71-1_3965.86_2.403.wav_ASR	and i don't really fold them the way i'm sposta
71-1_3968.54_0.71.wav_ASR	just kidding
71-1_3969.66_4.29.wav_ASR	and then put them away kind of as i use them when i
71-1_3985.92_4.75.wav_ASR	you mean what would i choose to wear or
71-1_3995.3_0.57.wav_ASR	oh i see
71-1_3996.39_11.38.wav_ASR	well the first thing i would do every morning is start my coffee because that really is gonna hafta happen before i make decisions about what matches what
71-1_4008.33_2.38.wav_ASR	oh i well start the
71-1_4011.9_2.75.wav_ASR	four i usually do the four over
71-1_4015.51_1.41.wav_ASR	and i really
71-1_4017.61_2.19.wav_ASR	so i usually would drink the coffee
71-1_4020.33_1.78.wav_ASR	started the the water
71-1_4023.83_2.36.wav_ASR	and i would go into my bed
71-1_4026.63_3.12.wav_ASR	generously i have some idea of what i'm gonna
71-1_4030.63_3.28.wav_ASR	if only because i hafta dig stuff out sometimes
71-1_4033.91_1.26.wav_ASR	five and i don't wanna have any
71-1_4035.602_4.45.wav_ASR	and i don't really have time to look a lot in the morning
71-1_4040.49_2.54.wav_ASR	so i'm getting a idea of what i'm gonna wear all ready
71-1_4043.51_5.14.wav_ASR	so i usually start well clear
71-1_4049.59_3.481.wav_ASR	then whatever pants or shirt i'm wearing
71-1_4053.071_3.66.wav_ASR	at that point it the water's usually ready
71-1_4057.231_2.079.wav_ASR	so yeah i got my life's club
71-1_4059.631_10.319.wav_ASR	well i'm you know running around here half dressed and then figuring out what kind of shirt i'm gonna wear whether and then trying to make decisions about how cold it is
71-1_4070.191_1.359.wav_ASR	so i needta wear it
71-1_4071.75_1.32.wav_ASR	do i needta wait a little
71-1_4073.07_2.819.wav_ASR	well the coffee's been made
71-1_4076.37_2.828.wav_ASR	but the time the cops are may i've got all my basic clothes on
71-1_4079.87_6.666.wav_ASR	and then i take the coffee with me in the bathroom when i make decisions about eating and all that other stuff
71-1_4086.94_4.822.wav_ASR	but yeah the basic is all the same as the night before so i don't hafta worry about it
71-1_4091.79_5.715.wav_ASR	and if i actually am tired and don't know what i'm doing i just worry back because it matches everything
71-1_4098.11_1.432.wav_ASR	so i've a lot of black clothes
71-1_4100.07_0.77.wav_ASR	oh there's that
71-2_14.77_15.16.wav_ASR	my favorite part about where i live and i live on the near east side of a mile away from the capital is that's close to the lake
71-2_30.89_1.34.wav_ASR	married and it's a city
71-2_32.41_2.38.wav_ASR	we we have four different lakes that are here
71-2_35.21_8.54.wav_ASR	and and the magic actually comes from a word from hocus pocus that actually specifically means forward
71-2_44.69_5.4.wav_ASR	so a block away from where i live is lake
71-2_50.725_3.302.wav_ASR	and it's the biggest of the lakes
71-2_54.665_6.7.wav_ASR	and what i like the most about it is there's a bike path to my
71-2_62.83_6.42.wav_ASR	the leg is too my left with a running path that goes along it
71-2_70.27_7.38.wav_ASR	and i literally can get pretty much every way that i needta go in the city of mackinaw without having to
71-2_79.43_1.82.wav_ASR	and i'm very close to the lake
71-2_82.17_4.02.wav_ASR	so one of the things i do when i run
71-2_86.95_2.98.wav_ASR	so now i would pretty much call it fast walk
71-2_90.071_3.86.wav_ASR	oh i'm not not not from my
71-2_94.531_6.34.wav_ASR	in my prime i would run about seven or eight miles a morning
71-2_100.931_2.26.wav_ASR	and i would get it down to about seven minutes
71-2_103.351_3.4.wav_ASR	well i'm pretty much just walking and
71-2_107.621_3.7.wav_ASR	and we're more like eleven minutes miles
71-2_111.741_2.56.wav_ASR	but i usually get about five in every morning
71-2_114.621_7.309.wav_ASR	it's it's kind of mediocre in the sense that you can look at the water
71-2_122.181_1.029.wav_ASR	you can see the bird
71-2_123.87_10.3.wav_ASR	it's just much more satisfied than it would be to be in a tree
71-2_134.77_3.32.wav_ASR	so it's one of the things i really like about where i live
71-2_139.91_1.36.wav_ASR	tree
71-2_142.244_0.5.wav_ASR	oh
71-2_144.217_0.467.wav_ASR	oh
71-2_144.93_1.073.wav_ASR	and i don't think that i'm
71-2_146.764_2.154.wav_ASR	that's the right word that i mean
71-2_149.284_0.5.wav_ASR	and i mean
71-2_153.748_0.593.wav_ASR	oh what is it
71-2_155.384_1.306.wav_ASR	oh i just see the word
71-2_156.884_0.526.wav_ASR	but i kept saying
71-2_157.764_1.566.wav_ASR	oh i'm screwing that word up
71-2_159.584_0.92.wav_ASR	but no i wasn't
71-2_160.706_2.562.wav_ASR	five times i hear a word that i already know
71-2_163.426_0.544.wav_ASR	and i keep saying
71-2_164.206_1.044.wav_ASR	that i'm saying that wrong
71-2_165.746_4.624.wav_ASR	but i i just hafta be realistic with words that i actually already know
71-2_171.106_0.564.wav_ASR	yeah
71-2_173.086_3.54.wav_ASR	the leg is much better than being on a treadmill
71-2_177.146_2.769.wav_ASR	and i the block away which is why i like living here
71-2_179.915_0.5.wav_ASR	yeah
71-2_200.31_2.58.wav_ASR	again my speech is not real
71-2_204.23_8.987.wav_ASR	but the most part when i speak i know what i'm going to say
71-2_213.77_16.481.wav_ASR	but if i try to say something that's more complicated some part of the way that i like to say them
71-2_230.251_8.589.wav_ASR	or the words are in my brain but i'm not quite able to articulate them the way that i wanna
71-2_238.97_3.38.wav_ASR	generally i know right away when i made a mistake
71-2_243.091_1.339.wav_ASR	but sometimes i don't
71-2_244.631_2.0.wav_ASR	yes dear i i said to someone
71-2_246.696_3.48.wav_ASR	well we've got this election coming up in january four
71-2_250.676_1.27.wav_ASR	and she said
71-2_253.536_0.404.wav_ASR	one four
71-2_253.94_0.621.wav_ASR	it's apple
71-2_254.576_0.84.wav_ASR	and i said
71-2_255.492_0.747.wav_ASR	what did i say
71-2_256.376_0.528.wav_ASR	and she said
71-2_256.996_0.815.wav_ASR	you said firstnamej
71-2_258.98_1.021.wav_ASR	well it feels like firstnamej
71-2_260.696_3.525.wav_ASR	again i try to just wing those and figure out how to get past that
71-2_264.41_8.22.wav_ASR	but i simply cannot trust that what will come out of my mouth is what i'm actually trying to
71-2_273.01_14.82.wav_ASR	and i don't know how to fix that except just to keep trying to relax those language parts that have been disrupted and try to catch some fast
71-2_295.73_2.62.wav_ASR	yes i remember exactly when i had a stroke
71-2_298.52_5.42.wav_ASR	had a stroke on january first twenty twenty one
71-2_320.33_14.302.wav_ASR	so i essentially had funeral chapel to my right temple love and did not know what it was for two days
71-2_335.13_1.573.wav_ASR	and then of course they invited me
71-2_336.703_9.4.wav_ASR	but it was passed the window of opportunity to be able to give me some type of drugs that might have broken up the clot
71-2_347.563_2.227.wav_ASR	so i entered the hospital
71-2_350.403_1.92.wav_ASR	as soon as i would have another stroke
71-2_353.183_0.607.wav_ASR	have not
71-2_354.09_4.36.wav_ASR	and they have not been able to find the costs of the initial
71-2_359.72_1.67.wav_ASR	as soon as it was the perfect storm
71-2_362.04_12.44.wav_ASR	as soon as it might have been a combination of working out really hard being stressed to be because of the pandemic and not being able to have christmas
71-2_374.76_2.765.wav_ASR	those were pretty magnificent day
71-2_378.52_3.0.wav_ASR	we were in a position then where it was pretty easy
71-2_381.743_3.632.wav_ASR	and and i don't know what else it could've been
71-2_385.583_5.67.wav_ASR	literally there's there's physically nothing wrong with my body
71-2_391.703_3.994.wav_ASR	and all of my numbers indicate that i should not have a stroke
71-2_395.843_2.223.wav_ASR	and yet yeah i had a stroke
71-2_398.363_1.62.wav_ASR	so yeah and yeah
71-2_400.181_2.92.wav_ASR	firstnamep firstnamec firstnamec
71-2_403.981_4.263.wav_ASR	which at some point i you just move on with that i guess
71-2_408.721_0.379.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
71-2_418.32_17.68.wav_ASR	well as i said a week ago most of the recovery has been successful and has not been too too difficult
71-2_437.57_8.66.wav_ASR	and i think that that's kind of travel in the sense that people have that
71-2_446.73_3.68.wav_ASR	yeah i was careful as having a military service
71-2_451.57_12.92.wav_ASR	we are we are in the position or the perfect to come to complete recover if we're given the right conditions in the right time
71-2_464.99_16.04.wav_ASR	so i think the first six months after stroke is really crucial in terms of recovery recovery because you're building on the positive recovery that that your brain is able to bring back language
71-2_482.13_11.14.wav_ASR	well i'm really disappointed in the answer that i was not given what i should have got
71-2_493.53_18.08.wav_ASR	so what i've done on my own is really increase my the quality of my diet which was already mediocre
71-2_511.89_1.417.wav_ASR	have already observed that
71-2_513.307_1.654.wav_ASR	and i've been doing that for about ten years
71-2_515.327_10.103.wav_ASR	and i gave up drinking completely though i don't really think that was an issue since i was drinking maybe one glass a month
71-2_525.43_10.02.wav_ASR	but it might increase flexibility no impairment
71-2_536.21_4.1.wav_ASR	it might increase inflammation in my body
71-2_540.325_10.3.wav_ASR	and that's something that i'm trying to work very strongly to make sure that i have an auntie family
71-2_551.465_1.7.wav_ASR	have extended my exercise
71-2_553.585_1.6.wav_ASR	again i'm already
71-2_559.81_19.778.wav_ASR	oh i've experienced the very complex complex test that i do every single day to make sure that i make make sure that my focus and consciousness levels are really healthy
71-2_579.588_2.895.wav_ASR	again i was in a coma
71-2_582.748_15.385.wav_ASR	so i have all always done a lot of reading every day doing a lot of close work every day trying to develop and we're able to do a lot of close work every single day
71-2_598.133_2.617.wav_ASR	and i've done it much more complex than in the past
71-2_601.85_7.16.wav_ASR	writing is always relieved in the sense that i have the option of either
71-2_609.473_2.297.wav_ASR	and i do sometimes use the wrong word
71-2_612.753_2.617.wav_ASR	but i you just generally catch it when i at it
71-2_615.79_3.34.wav_ASR	and i always hadta eat it before the stroke too
71-2_619.37_9.39.wav_ASR	so i don't know too what extent those mistakes are correct or whether that's just the way that i write
71-2_628.91_4.36.wav_ASR	sometimes you do a rough draft to get the ideas out
71-2_633.443_2.915.wav_ASR	and then you find it the second time around
71-2_637.303_9.727.wav_ASR	so i i i think the only real difference from the way in which i live after the stroke but before is making sure that i always get enough
71-2_647.963_4.187.wav_ASR	before the stroke i tried to get sleep
71-2_652.45_7.12.wav_ASR	but if i didn't i just poured on because i have a schedule that i hafta
71-2_660.87_8.901.wav_ASR	now it's it's a priority for me to the extent that i sleep as much as i can
71-2_670.05_5.06.wav_ASR	but i just have a restaurant every single day that i always always done
71-2_676.49_0.563.wav_ASR	they're really well
71-2_677.41_1.165.wav_ASR	exercising every day
71-2_679.05_2.72.wav_ASR	push my brain as much as i can
71-2_682.23_7.28.wav_ASR	and i made attempt to take back up a language skill
71-2_689.79_3.4.wav_ASR	was taking spanish class before the stroke
71-2_693.397_2.653.wav_ASR	three i took branch when i was in high school
71-2_696.33_3.6.wav_ASR	and i picked up a little bit of dance when i lived in kootenay
71-2_701.01_4.263.wav_ASR	but i thought spanish would be much more useful than french
71-2_706.37_2.1.wav_ASR	so i started taking a spanish class
71-2_708.69_4.73.wav_ASR	and i hadta disconnect because it was late at night
71-2_713.57_1.99.wav_ASR	it just really wasn't working out for me
71-2_716.7_10.19.wav_ASR	but from what i read recently i think one of the things that might be really helpful to realize my english is to pick up spanish
71-2_727.56_1.88.wav_ASR	it's i you know i don't
71-2_729.6_1.14.wav_ASR	they thought it might be confusing
71-2_731.12_2.971.wav_ASR	but why not try it you know
71-2_734.091_1.949.wav_ASR	why not yes but what happens
71-2_736.54_3.066.wav_ASR	so yeah that may be what i do next
71-2_739.76_1.333.wav_ASR	what i'm already doing
71-2_767.08_3.158.wav_ASR	let me see
71-2_771.54_4.68.wav_ASR	happy sad
71-2_779.25_0.7.wav_ASR	oh
71-2_782.83_5.9.wav_ASR	and i'm gonna talk about my recovery to what happened on nine eleven in two thousand and one
71-2_790.19_2.46.wav_ASR	three i was ten
71-2_793.11_3.98.wav_ASR	it was the beginning of the the spring semester in two thousand and one
71-2_797.09_4.16.wav_ASR	and and my daughter had gone to school
71-2_803.03_9.82.wav_ASR	so as soon as she left at at about eight fifteen i got on the computer because i hadta finish my school
71-2_813.15_3.66.wav_ASR	yes i i should have already finished my sandwich
71-2_817.67_1.9.wav_ASR	and it was generally done
71-2_819.73_2.089.wav_ASR	but i was kinda playing with some of the end of it
71-2_822.23_5.923.wav_ASR	my extended policy class because i just wanted to just stayed a little bit
71-2_828.41_1.08.wav_ASR	so i wasn't on line
71-2_830.33_2.92.wav_ASR	obviously the ray was not because i hadta concentrate
71-2_833.352_4.423.wav_ASR	or i certainly wasn't watching television when i was trying to do my work
71-2_837.872_12.614.wav_ASR	so i was in this phone of size with no connection to the outside what so ever just going through these different articles and deciding which one would fit best in terms of what i was trying to do
71-2_851.51_5.54.wav_ASR	and at two o'clock in the afternoon i was gonna take a break
71-2_857.21_3.32.wav_ASR	and i was gonna go to my gym and work out
71-2_861.07_1.14.wav_ASR	and it was a beautiful day
71-2_862.61_1.64.wav_ASR	was you know stepmother oh
71-2_868.85_0.8.wav_ASR	and i turned on the radio
71-2_870.87_3.98.wav_ASR	and the announcement said
71-2_875.69_2.16.wav_ASR	and i don't really know if the schools are gonna close
71-2_878.53_0.64.wav_ASR	and i kept saying
71-2_879.77_1.12.wav_ASR	the school's getting along
71-2_881.09_0.48.wav_ASR	it's funny
71-2_888.143_3.145.wav_ASR	and and i got to the the gym
71-2_892.33_2.473.wav_ASR	and they were terrible ever
71-2_895.423_2.206.wav_ASR	they were in the desk when you come in
71-2_897.723_1.36.wav_ASR	and that never except
71-2_899.443_1.827.wav_ASR	everybody looked really really upset
71-2_901.963_1.96.wav_ASR	so i i'm walking in there saying
71-2_904.483_2.874.wav_ASR	think happened here that i don't know about
71-2_907.37_1.5.wav_ASR	but everybody else knows it
71-2_909.35_2.12.wav_ASR	they're all staring at the screen
71-2_911.55_3.34.wav_ASR	so i went to the second were my treat
71-2_915.83_3.818.wav_ASR	and again the treadmills were running along the way
71-2_919.77_3.262.wav_ASR	but that's what i was gonna do that day because i hadta do some lifting
71-2_923.27_1.915.wav_ASR	and that's what i saw
71-2_925.185_12.8.wav_ASR	but at that point by two o'clock in the afternoon they were just reeling it over and over and over again about the two times that were hitting the the window windows in december
71-2_938.265_2.813.wav_ASR	and they were intimidating people who were trying to get away
71-2_941.365_1.64.wav_ASR	everything is covered with ashes
71-2_944.49_6.22.wav_ASR	and i remember getting on the the the treadmill and you know putting on my head phone and listening to music
71-2_951.07_7.56.wav_ASR	and i just kept going faster and faster and faster because the adrenaline of what it happened was just so shock
71-2_959.41_3.86.wav_ASR	so i kinda use that you know to increase my work
71-2_963.53_2.82.wav_ASR	and i got out of there
71-2_966.61_1.02.wav_ASR	and i went home and said
71-2_967.91_0.384.wav_ASR	oh man
71-2_968.294_4.966.wav_ASR	and i got a really close friend that lives in dc that works near the pentagon
71-2_973.35_2.086.wav_ASR	so it's he
71-2_975.69_0.829.wav_ASR	what's going on
71-2_977.21_0.94.wav_ASR	so i tried to call
71-2_978.45_3.78.wav_ASR	of course i couldn't get through because all the the sisters were were
71-2_982.23_3.06.wav_ASR	one noone could get home and desk
71-2_985.57_1.836.wav_ASR	everything was shot down
71-2_988.71_2.16.wav_ASR	and i got on
71-2_991.09_0.94.wav_ASR	and i start email
71-2_992.31_1.48.wav_ASR	then i eat my dinner
71-2_993.97_1.78.wav_ASR	and i was in the political science department
71-2_995.93_0.34.wav_ASR	and say
71-2_996.81_2.067.wav_ASR	we're gonna have a ball on campus
71-2_999.41_1.76.wav_ASR	we're gonna invite the committee
71-2_1001.32_2.481.wav_ASR	we and we're going to explain what it's going on
71-2_1004.36_5.934.wav_ASR	and we're gonna explain all of it
71-2_1010.3_3.871.wav_ASR	we're gonna explain the the rehabilitation of it
71-2_1014.18_3.5.wav_ASR	we're gonna talk about the history of
71-2_1018.48_2.588.wav_ASR	we're explaining exactly what's going on here
71-2_1021.068_3.442.wav_ASR	and everybody got back to me and me being
71-2_1024.788_2.32.wav_ASR	mean they everyone found it and said
71-2_1027.288_1.502.wav_ASR	and i'd be happy to talk about this
71-2_1029.048_5.302.wav_ASR	and i'd be happy to talk about the science in a way that are going on current
71-2_1034.35_7.22.wav_ASR	and maybe that's related to what's going on with the the the the barns that are
71-2_1041.762_18.784.wav_ASR	we all knew at that point that they were coming from the middle east and the pennsylvania state and the world trade center as cities of importance and the western coast
71-2_1060.546_2.0.wav_ASR	and and how it is that we're
71-2_1063.386_1.58.wav_ASR	they were employees with us
71-2_1066.026_2.694.wav_ASR	oh yeah it all came together really
71-2_1069.006_1.514.wav_ASR	we went to bed at one in the morning
71-2_1071.126_4.007.wav_ASR	finally got email back from my friend and firstnamee who was fine
71-2_1075.986_3.141.wav_ASR	and got up went to campus the next day
71-2_1079.127_3.12.wav_ASR	and all the the letters were just scrambled
71-2_1082.467_8.34.wav_ASR	and all we did is talk about what happened in every single class hour after hour after hour
71-2_1091.927_2.073.wav_ASR	alright alright that's that's a lot there
71-2_1094.327_0.6.wav_ASR	yeah
71-2_1095.507_3.195.wav_ASR	it was a great plan by the way
71-2_1098.702_2.177.wav_ASR	we'd think we had five hundred people
71-2_1101.002_4.48.wav_ASR	it standing standing standing
71-2_1106.562_0.607.wav_ASR	my turn to say
71-2_1107.262_1.0.wav_ASR	he's standing
71-2_1108.642_3.021.wav_ASR	people hadta stand in the back
71-2_1111.942_1.56.wav_ASR	but what i'm trying to say is strange
71-2_1115.89_2.82.wav_ASR	well these fears that i useta be able to say
71-2_1118.87_0.92.wav_ASR	and i start to say it
71-2_1119.99_1.393.wav_ASR	and i forget what they're in the middle
71-2_1122.11_1.8.wav_ASR	standing room only
71-2_1124.33_0.389.wav_ASR	yeah we
71-2_1124.719_2.671.wav_ASR	fill up the place basically and wash it
71-2_1127.69_1.1.wav_ASR	and everybody's crazy
71-2_1129.59_0.76.wav_ASR	how did they hate us
71-2_1130.57_2.4.wav_ASR	and that's what we begin with
71-2_1133.59_0.94.wav_ASR	oh okay
71-2_1136.424_12.445.wav_ASR	other than i missed the whole thing because of course i was on line writing a letter that i never gave because you know certain standards took over where we were
71-2_1189.34_19.84.wav_ASR	well it seems to be taking place in neighborhood a neighborhood which is relatively close to each other
71-2_1209.06_5.336.wav_ASR	and it looks like what's going on is a boy is in the back yard
71-2_1214.88_2.2.wav_ASR	and he's playing with his soccer
71-2_1217.52_1.92.wav_ASR	he's practicing his car
71-2_1220.38_11.126.wav_ASR	unfortunately this time the ball doesn't not go where he hoped it would go and crash in to the window
71-2_1232.06_5.1.wav_ASR	and it looks like it might have been the window of his next door neighbor
71-2_1237.38_1.26.wav_ASR	but it could've been his father
71-2_1238.86_0.86.wav_ASR	it's difficult to know
71-2_1239.78_7.2.wav_ASR	but it was a window that was next to the yard in which he was playing with his soccer ball
71-2_1247.88_3.96.wav_ASR	well it hit the the glass of the window and broke it
71-2_1252.48_4.08.wav_ASR	unfortunately there was a man that was sitting in the chair right next to the window
71-2_1257.78_7.66.wav_ASR	and the soccer ball not only broke the window but went through completely into the the house
71-2_1266.32_2.88.wav_ASR	oh apparently they have no strings from what i'm guessing
71-2_1269.48_2.687.wav_ASR	so it can't be surprised because we have mcs in here
71-2_1272.167_11.407.wav_ASR	and the ball ended up in the house in the house directly where the man was sitting
71-2_1284.62_3.27.wav_ASR	and he was not pleased about this
71-2_1288.15_5.76.wav_ASR	he stood up and looked out the window to try to figure out who had broken the window
71-2_1294.2_1.43.wav_ASR	where did the ball come from
71-2_1295.93_9.0.wav_ASR	and who is the person who had protected that ball toward his window
71-2_1305.71_7.06.wav_ASR	he's it's clearly that there's going to be some kind of management as a result of this
71-2_1313.51_3.88.wav_ASR	because if it's his son his son is going to be school
71-2_1317.638_12.22.wav_ASR	and and if it's his neighbor he's gonna expect an appointment and probably some sort of pain to repair the the glass that's been broken
71-2_1331.61_2.368.wav_ASR	so umbrella in the summer
71-2_1351.36_23.18.wav_ASR	well we're gonna tell we're gonna tell this story mother knows best which is a play on the fact that they're apparently was a much older twelve
71-2_1374.637_1.24.wav_ASR	using it was very pesky
71-2_1376.717_2.203.wav_ASR	you know the father leaves
71-2_1379.217_1.12.wav_ASR	mother is the housewife
71-2_1380.877_2.16.wav_ASR	the father knows best
71-2_1383.339_19.92.wav_ASR	oh in any case this particular story is gonna be mother no besides their children
71-2_1403.327_4.073.wav_ASR	but not always but in this particular case that's exactly what's happening
71-2_1407.4_17.237.wav_ASR	and and what's going on is this child and the child's mother is debating whether this boy needs to take an umbrella with him when he leaves
71-2_1424.637_5.175.wav_ASR	the mother is saying because they're getting ready for the boy to go off on his own
71-2_1430.477_1.44.wav_ASR	and the mother is saying
71-2_1432.357_10.134.wav_ASR	it depends on what we see with the clothes that are outside the the sky and what we see on the weather report it looks like it's gonna rain
71-2_1442.577_1.295.wav_ASR	so i think he should take an umbrella
71-2_1443.872_2.02.wav_ASR	well and the little boy is going like
71-2_1446.272_1.58.wav_ASR	he's not taking an umbrella
71-2_1448.132_1.546.wav_ASR	and i don't need one
71-2_1450.032_1.204.wav_ASR	and i don't care if it rain
71-2_1451.572_0.969.wav_ASR	oh i'm not gonna make it
71-2_1453.572_2.904.wav_ASR	my i'm fine on my own
71-2_1457.132_0.708.wav_ASR	so she said
71-2_1458.152_1.904.wav_ASR	well alright you know best
71-2_1460.812_1.116.wav_ASR	and she says goodbye to him
71-2_1462.212_0.403.wav_ASR	and he
71-2_1462.615_2.1.wav_ASR	if she's still holding the umbrella
71-2_1465.335_0.768.wav_ASR	he heads out
71-2_1466.655_2.06.wav_ASR	and it's not just a problem
71-2_1468.935_3.82.wav_ASR	but it really really starts to rain really hard
71-2_1472.915_1.22.wav_ASR	it's a downpour
71-2_1475.7_2.625.wav_ASR	and he doesn't happen
71-2_1478.655_2.945.wav_ASR	so the rain is getting inside
71-2_1481.94_2.26.wav_ASR	and he's getting really really wet
71-2_1484.32_4.93.wav_ASR	his clothes are getting drenched and scattered scattered with the water
71-2_1489.82_1.78.wav_ASR	so he gets about half a mile
71-2_1492.22_1.78.wav_ASR	and he can't even say what was going on
71-2_1494.3_3.58.wav_ASR	so he heads back to his mother very
71-2_1499.24_0.76.wav_ASR	he looks at her
71-2_1501.22_2.46.wav_ASR	and she has the glass not to say
71-2_1503.88_0.744.wav_ASR	and i told you so
71-2_1505.06_1.279.wav_ASR	because mother's no better
71-2_1506.48_1.32.wav_ASR	they knew but that never worked
71-2_1508.74_1.78.wav_ASR	and he stands there and looks at her
71-2_1510.86_1.98.wav_ASR	and she hands him the umbrella
71-2_1513.76_0.96.wav_ASR	he heads off again
71-2_1515.14_3.02.wav_ASR	three this time remembering in his brain
71-2_1519.26_3.04.wav_ASR	my mother's not always wrong about everything
71-2_1524.14_4.02.wav_ASR	but of course he forgets it by the next week when something else comes up
71-2_1528.48_7.687.wav_ASR	where we are in this week he is now assured that his mother actually has a wish which he does not get
71-2_1536.5_2.081.wav_ASR	three mother's not happy
71-2_1555.22_3.121.wav_ASR	well speaking of drama in the newspaper
71-2_1559.54_8.9.wav_ASR	what had happened here between because the cat was sitting on the porch
71-2_1569.36_3.67.wav_ASR	and the cat has the right to sit on the the
71-2_1573.78_3.17.wav_ASR	but the next door neighbor has a dog
71-2_1576.95_6.958.wav_ASR	and the dog came out and immediately saw the cat and ran over and started barking at the cat
71-2_1584.11_1.22.wav_ASR	and the cat was
71-2_1586.07_5.36.wav_ASR	so the cat ran from the the dog and ran up the tree because that was close
71-2_1591.15_6.0.wav_ASR	close and that was a way to get away from the dog from the dog because the dog couldn't climb
71-2_1597.65_2.042.wav_ASR	so the cat climbed up the tree
71-2_1600.41_0.894.wav_ASR	to see young kid
71-2_1601.49_6.55.wav_ASR	it's a cat that's just barely a kitten and isn't really a problem to be back
71-2_1608.43_1.61.wav_ASR	so the cat crawled up
71-2_1610.78_6.66.wav_ASR	the little girl ran out saw her cat was up in the tree and called her father and said
71-2_1619.16_1.18.wav_ASR	the cat is up in the tree
71-2_1621.04_3.96.wav_ASR	and she's out on the bar
71-2_1625.76_9.82.wav_ASR	and it doesn't look like she's finding her way to get back out because she's mourning you know very lovely and clearly wants to be rescued
71-2_1636.4_1.22.wav_ASR	so please help me
71-2_1638.16_2.86.wav_ASR	please help me get my cat out of the tree
71-2_1641.3_3.6.wav_ASR	the father's trying to be silly and the hair
71-2_1645.16_4.36.wav_ASR	so he immediately goes into the garage and finds his ladder
71-2_1650.2_21.487.wav_ASR	and the plan for him was he would simply be able to climb up the the ladder get to the tree inch his way up to the limb
71-2_1671.68_2.39.wav_ASR	and then he could be you know the heir
71-2_1674.76_5.62.wav_ASR	he could feel his daughters' reach
71-2_1681.42_2.26.wav_ASR	unfortunately he got up in the tree
71-2_1684.54_10.49.wav_ASR	and the he had clearly read the letter against the tree and the way he really needed it
71-2_1695.33_1.1.wav_ASR	and it fell
71-2_1697.33_4.1.wav_ASR	so now we have two people that hafta be rescued from the tree
71-2_1701.65_7.1.wav_ASR	we have the cat that is still meowing loudly out in the fire
71-2_1709.29_12.14.wav_ASR	and of course the father can't reach it because he's his way is too heavy to be able to move into those limbs without bringing them down
71-2_1721.65_1.78.wav_ASR	and then he would fall down and get her
71-2_1724.19_6.76.wav_ASR	so at this point the mother who knows best has called the fire department and says
71-2_1731.81_2.587.wav_ASR	they got a slipper fitting going on here
71-2_1734.59_1.211.wav_ASR	well that isn't what she said
71-2_1735.801_6.58.wav_ASR	but that's what she thought in her brain because she doesn't say words or any children because she doesn't want them to know about her father
71-2_1742.881_2.24.wav_ASR	can you please bring
71-2_1745.553_16.023.wav_ASR	unfortunately we now need help help from firefighters to not only get the cat out of the tree but my husband who try climb up to help rescue the cat
71-2_1761.576_6.523.wav_ASR	and my daughter is still saying because she's worried about the cat
71-2_1768.376_1.494.wav_ASR	and now she's worried about her dad
71-2_1770.876_2.274.wav_ASR	and the dog is still barking
71-2_1773.756_3.1.wav_ASR	what does she be doing as she's about ready
71-2_1777.576_1.228.wav_ASR	because the fire firefighters are here
71-2_1779.076_1.061.wav_ASR	and they're coming over
71-2_1780.05_2.35.wav_ASR	and they're going to help the man get down first
71-2_1782.71_3.09.wav_ASR	and then they're going to reach out and get the cat
71-2_1786.3_8.752.wav_ASR	and what the mother's gonna do is she's gonna go and grab the dog and put him in the other room so that everybody will relax a bit
71-2_1796.11_3.213.wav_ASR	everybody can make it out of the tree without getting hurt
71-2_1799.323_1.586.wav_ASR	the man
71-2_2004.09_16.38.wav_ASR	and what we're especially looking for here is exceptional ability and special mobility and what the priority is that woman hafta please in order to improve their situation in size
71-2_2021.77_1.86.wav_ASR	so we're gonna start with that
71-2_2023.99_13.24.wav_ASR	and this is an example of the very recent rolls that were available to women in certain colors and certain sizes
71-2_2038.46_5.74.wav_ASR	now what we're seeing here is a family which is really little quick
71-2_2045.26_10.16.wav_ASR	and the in both cases what we had were two family with children
71-2_2056.56_3.02.wav_ASR	and each of them had a spouse that died
71-2_2061.01_13.758.wav_ASR	the husband had one daughter who was living with him
71-2_2075.16_1.256.wav_ASR	but but his wife had died
71-2_2076.416_3.656.wav_ASR	so he had a young daughter who was about six years old
71-2_2080.296_11.24.wav_ASR	again in university science of we'll go back to well we'll say nineteen seventy five men could not raise their own children
71-2_2091.936_1.731.wav_ASR	they hadta have a woman
71-2_2093.856_0.741.wav_ASR	it was her world
71-2_2094.68_3.78.wav_ASR	well people were ridiculously ridiculous in terms of what they were allowed to
71-2_2099.12_3.78.wav_ASR	so he hadta find a wife in order to carry for his daughter
71-2_2103.96_13.22.wav_ASR	in another part of town relatively same state we have a man and woman and wife who had two children
71-2_2118.02_0.76.wav_ASR	and he
71-2_2119.64_8.66.wav_ASR	so the only way that she would be able to survive as a female is to find a wife or find another man that would marry her
71-2_2129.4_2.86.wav_ASR	so they're both out looking for her
71-2_2133.36_1.3.wav_ASR	and they meet each other
71-2_2135.0_28.16.wav_ASR	and of course what the husband is looking for the wife as a mother and you know will do all the the other things that woman is sposta do and that man doesn't do because we have very restricted very different different degrees of social status society
71-2_2164.74_1.14.wav_ASR	so they meet each other
71-2_2166.5_3.74.wav_ASR	and he's gotten the impression that she's gonna be a wonderful wife
71-2_2170.64_3.8.wav_ASR	he certainly jumps all over his daughter
71-2_2175.66_1.62.wav_ASR	and so they they marry
71-2_2177.28_12.12.wav_ASR	they're now three children two daughters from her original family her daughter named cinderella from her family
71-2_2189.86_2.76.wav_ASR	and they've now blended into this new side
71-2_2193.69_11.26.wav_ASR	the father then feels his rule which is go out and makes money for the family and leaves the house under the management of the stepmother
71-2_2205.31_21.673.wav_ASR	the stepmother on the other hand has not failed her her daughters and is going to treat the other stepdaughter as if she's a maid
71-2_2227.87_6.94.wav_ASR	and for whatever reason the father just not interested in what he sees when he is home
71-2_2235.41_10.02.wav_ASR	and so what we have is this this really terrible situation that's really terrible situation that it gives for cinderella
71-2_2245.527_4.893.wav_ASR	and cinderella again had a beautiful mother who loved her
71-2_2250.667_1.201.wav_ASR	he was close to her father
71-2_2252.027_0.76.wav_ASR	he loved her
71-2_2253.147_9.1.wav_ASR	now she's also in this situation where she's clearly treated differently than her stepdaughters stepdaughters
71-2_2262.887_2.555.wav_ASR	smack small piece of bread
71-2_2265.442_1.074.wav_ASR	her happens all the time
71-2_2267.022_0.954.wav_ASR	every day moving on
71-2_2269.122_1.278.wav_ASR	again they live in september
71-2_2270.462_8.32.wav_ASR	it's no way that woman can improve their their position in this situation except through marriage
71-2_2279.762_2.46.wav_ASR	is the only possible option to them
71-2_2282.222_18.073.wav_ASR	and and so they're primary rule growing up is to learn how to manage a house and also be active to the healthcare professionals that are available to them
71-2_2300.295_2.36.wav_ASR	and i don't know what happens if they're not healthy
71-2_2303.295_2.211.wav_ASR	yes they just fake it
71-2_2305.815_2.972.wav_ASR	in any case that's not part of this particular story
71-2_2309.455_1.22.wav_ASR	and she's scared
71-2_2310.915_3.032.wav_ASR	and so that's one concept she doesn't hafta deal with
71-2_2313.947_8.6.wav_ASR	and in the afternoon on the other side of the city at a higher place is
71-2_2323.465_20.82.wav_ASR	and again while the prince has apparently a lot of money power and he's at the top of his college and social status he's also obligated to marry
71-2_2344.363_9.7.wav_ASR	because the plan is that he will marry a wife and that wife will then be her child
71-2_2354.443_6.44.wav_ASR	and those children then means that they will be a lieutenant that will continue on to the next generation
71-2_2361.383_1.861.wav_ASR	so he may not wanna get married
71-2_2363.24_6.92.wav_ASR	and we don't really know what his gentleman's name is or or origin
71-2_2370.56_2.72.wav_ASR	but he's he understands what his job is
71-2_2373.42_1.38.wav_ASR	he hasta find a woman
71-2_2375.14_1.42.wav_ASR	he hasta find a part
71-2_2377.46_11.7.wav_ASR	and his plan is to find someone who's relatively attractive while he feels the opportunities of his office in the structure social structure in which they exercise
71-2_2389.76_4.76.wav_ASR	so the plan is he's gonna get this over with quick
71-2_2394.609_4.6.wav_ASR	they're gonna have this huge dance the huge ball
71-2_2400.449_1.88.wav_ASR	every one in the kingdom
71-2_2403.749_2.623.wav_ASR	my i'm assuming we're pretty much middle class in a nutshell
71-2_2406.669_3.7.wav_ASR	he's not really going to the picture crash crash
71-2_2410.569_1.731.wav_ASR	it's not part of this at all
71-2_2413.36_14.64.wav_ASR	is inviting all the eligible females who are not married who would like to come and visit for him so that he can walk through and make his
71-2_2429.0_1.96.wav_ASR	again this is clearly
71-2_2432.56_5.54.wav_ASR	it seems like that baseball show which i've never seen and neither would see
71-2_2438.84_2.588.wav_ASR	but i certainly know aware of it
71-2_2441.428_16.26.wav_ASR	that that woman are gonna be tested and graded and choose out of a line of other available women to be able to be the one that he is deciding to mate with
71-2_2458.96_11.18.wav_ASR	so anyway all three of these women the two stepsisters and cinderella all no that they are evil
71-2_2470.64_6.62.wav_ASR	and they all start thinking about how wonderful their the situation would be if they get
71-2_2477.759_2.965.wav_ASR	and again what's interesting is we're not talking about love
71-2_2480.919_2.54.wav_ASR	we're not talking about you know
71-2_2485.819_3.132.wav_ASR	we're not talking about people that are complicated with each other
71-2_2489.099_5.541.wav_ASR	we're talking about they will somehow be affected enough for this mail to choose them
71-2_2495.14_6.668.wav_ASR	and then their life situation will improve because those are the only options that are available to them
71-2_2502.2_11.34.wav_ASR	again it's a very restricted situation and a certain time and in color which is very very limited for family and in color which is very very limited
71-2_2514.72_1.813.wav_ASR	so they're they're all getting ready
71-2_2516.76_1.25.wav_ASR	and they know what they hafta do
71-2_2518.04_0.98.wav_ASR	they hafta look at it
71-2_2519.46_1.52.wav_ASR	so they hafta have a really nice dress
71-2_2521.32_1.34.wav_ASR	her hair's to be fixed up
71-2_2522.8_14.67.wav_ASR	but they hafta somehow make them stand out from the others and order to be chosen in this degree level class that they're gonna be interested in
71-2_2538.05_7.3.wav_ASR	so because the stepmother favors her own daughters she pulls out whatever money they have a ball
71-2_2545.61_13.82.wav_ASR	and she gets them the the the fancy dress that you could possibly choose and you know with hair dresses and to get their hair done and everything else to get them as gorgeous
71-2_2560.48_2.99.wav_ASR	firstnamec pretty much knows she's on her own
71-2_2563.97_8.22.wav_ASR	so she pulls out a book that she got from her mother which has patterns of dresses
71-2_2572.57_8.51.wav_ASR	because she's very smart and very quick and because she's hadta do a lot of the mental work in the house she knows how to show
71-2_2581.9_5.18.wav_ASR	so she pulls together some scraps of material that are available to her
71-2_2587.26_3.6.wav_ASR	and she puts together this pretty cool dress really
71-2_2591.12_1.64.wav_ASR	and it's kinda off the shore
71-2_2593.16_3.109.wav_ASR	you know it's kinda pink which kinda plays off her hair
71-2_2597.18_1.602.wav_ASR	and she's ready to go
71-2_2599.24_1.68.wav_ASR	he's doing the best that she
71-2_2600.92_1.16.wav_ASR	hand that's what she has
71-2_2602.7_0.86.wav_ASR	and she's ready
71-2_2603.98_2.02.wav_ASR	and of course her mother says
71-2_2606.3_1.06.wav_ASR	they're no similar thing
71-2_2609.46_2.94.wav_ASR	you are not of our star
71-2_2612.88_1.4.wav_ASR	you are a patient
71-2_2615.14_2.22.wav_ASR	you don't have the right clothes for it
71-2_2617.64_1.2.wav_ASR	you are dressed correctly
71-2_2619.54_0.74.wav_ASR	you are not gonna
71-2_2620.5_1.42.wav_ASR	my daughters are going
71-2_2622.98_4.02.wav_ASR	they the stepsisters of course have got their shoe from their mother
71-2_2627.22_1.94.wav_ASR	they knew to be really really cool to her
71-2_2629.38_1.02.wav_ASR	so they laugh at her
71-2_2631.4_4.92.wav_ASR	and she goes out in the barn to take care of the animals because that's kind of her favorite
71-2_2636.32_4.32.wav_ASR	that's the place where she can go and get some kind of effect from the other end
71-2_2641.04_0.764.wav_ASR	and she's out there
71-2_2642.1_1.3.wav_ASR	you know she's
71-2_2644.4_2.137.wav_ASR	and she's wearing her dress and her
71-2_2647.06_1.593.wav_ASR	you know she doesn't know what she's gonna do
71-2_2648.78_0.6.wav_ASR	what is she
71-2_2649.62_7.806.wav_ASR	what can she possibly do to somehow get out of the military situation that she's in
71-2_2657.46_8.42.wav_ASR	and this fairy godmother appears to her because she's you know a wonderful person
71-2_2666.1_1.27.wav_ASR	he's giving to other people
71-2_2667.6_1.24.wav_ASR	but she discovers it
71-2_2669.7_4.22.wav_ASR	so this fairy godmother shows up and says
71-2_2674.82_0.58.wav_ASR	here you go
71-2_2675.52_0.52.wav_ASR	what's wrong
71-2_2676.1_0.7.wav_ASR	what do you mean
71-2_2677.62_0.66.wav_ASR	and she said
71-2_2678.52_2.04.wav_ASR	and i would like to go to the the ball
71-2_2680.9_1.26.wav_ASR	but i want to wear

71-2_2689.8_7.06.wav_ASR	and i wanna be able to have the same opinions that my stepsisters have
71-2_2697.8_0.58.wav_ASR	so she

71-2_2700.72_5.86.wav_ASR	and she you know uses her her magical abilities and
71-2_2707.42_0.56.wav_ASR	and she looks
71-2_2708.52_7.98.wav_ASR	and she trains the rats into horses that will be pulling a carriage
71-2_2716.86_3.12.wav_ASR	and the court carriage is transported from a pumpkin
71-2_2721.2_4.98.wav_ASR	and she uses her wand and and goes over cinderella's
71-2_2726.24_11.79.wav_ASR	and all of a sudden she's wearing these oh neat elegant beautiful
71-2_2738.29_8.18.wav_ASR	her hair is is made up and the the the the

71-2_2789.37_2.005.wav_ASR	so please go

71-2_2792.712_5.46.wav_ASR	but recognize this is just a moment out of your existence
71-2_2798.512_7.04.wav_ASR	it's a special bill that that is hitting your your interest
71-2_2805.892_1.758.wav_ASR	but it's not really gonna change everything
71-2_2808.012_1.558.wav_ASR	please enjoy your moment
71-2_2810.63_3.14.wav_ASR	so she hushes the fairy godmother
71-2_2814.41_1.88.wav_ASR	and she gets in the coach
71-2_2817.21_2.2.wav_ASR	he's taken to the
71-2_2820.33_0.36.wav_ASR	yes
71-2_2821.17_8.52.wav_ASR	even her stepsisters don't know who this woman is because she's dressed so amazingly that she stands out
71-2_2830.55_10.16.wav_ASR	all the other people that are watching all they can think of as a really really rich
71-2_2842.35_1.34.wav_ASR	and we don't know of her
71-2_2843.97_3.16.wav_ASR	but she must be from a very high school
71-2_2847.65_1.71.wav_ASR	and she's clearly very beautiful
71-2_2849.56_5.5.wav_ASR	meanwhile the fact that they don't even recognize their own stepdaughter is pretty terrible
71-2_2855.87_1.702.wav_ASR	in the afternoon she walks in
71-2_2858.34_8.7.wav_ASR	the prince immediately in his own form sees her and says
71-2_2867.361_0.856.wav_ASR	he's the stand up
71-2_2868.82_1.51.wav_ASR	he's she's the one
71-2_2870.72_1.77.wav_ASR	and he heads over to work
71-2_2872.76_1.61.wav_ASR	he immediately looks at her
71-2_2874.58_5.47.wav_ASR	see she sees that she's also beautiful on top of being well dressed
71-2_2880.91_1.45.wav_ASR	he's all so great
71-2_2882.78_0.91.wav_ASR	and she's a wonderful dance
71-2_2884.34_0.31.wav_ASR	there's a cat
71-2_2885.36_1.74.wav_ASR	there's a lot of magic
71-2_2887.88_2.89.wav_ASR	there's there's kindergarten between
71-2_2891.62_0.875.wav_ASR	and he said
71-2_2893.18_1.008.wav_ASR	he's thinking it's mine
71-2_2894.42_1.321.wav_ASR	but i thought this was gonna be awful
71-2_2896.04_2.52.wav_ASR	and i thought this was gonna be a dirty a dirty
71-2_2898.78_2.795.wav_ASR	but i really like her
71-2_2902.0_1.34.wav_ASR	oh this is
71-2_2903.86_2.26.wav_ASR	he was hoping for something this match
71-2_2906.281_1.956.wav_ASR	and i was prepared for something else
71-2_2908.461_1.931.wav_ASR	just just can work
71-2_2910.761_2.955.wav_ASR	so he wants to spend time with her as much as he can
71-2_2913.941_0.479.wav_ASR	opens it
71-2_2914.681_0.98.wav_ASR	and she's in to it too
71-2_2915.801_1.52.wav_ASR	me and they're they're really connected
71-2_2917.761_1.52.wav_ASR	it's just this wonderful bike
71-2_2920.001_4.289.wav_ASR	and then she looks up at the clock and sees that it's five minutes to midnight
71-2_2926.49_28.8.wav_ASR	and she knows because of this paper school class that she lives in as soon as she sees what she really looks like how she's wearing
71-2_2956.938_4.418.wav_ASR	he she knows that that alone will also be gone
71-2_2961.538_9.22.wav_ASR	he she's pretty sure that what he really wanted is the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the
71-2_2971.438_5.015.wav_ASR	so she knows that as soon as he sees who she really is it's gonna be over
71-2_2976.453_4.78.wav_ASR	so she races away as quickly as she can because she wants to get away
71-2_2981.093_8.34.wav_ASR	he doesn't wanna see the look in his eye when he sees who she really is and what her real state is and how she's really dressed
71-2_2990.23_2.14.wav_ASR	so he's he doesn't understand what happened
71-2_2992.653_0.437.wav_ASR	here she goes
71-2_2993.173_0.717.wav_ASR	what did he say
71-2_2994.053_1.277.wav_ASR	did he say something to me
71-2_2995.46_1.51.wav_ASR	they're here she helping
71-2_2997.36_6.02.wav_ASR	and she races away as quickly as she can so quickly that she trips on her shoe
71-2_3003.6_0.62.wav_ASR	and she
71-2_3004.74_1.712.wav_ASR	her shoe falls off
71-2_3006.6_1.342.wav_ASR	he doesn't have time to grab it
71-2_3008.32_0.93.wav_ASR	he's gotta get gone
71-2_3009.56_0.89.wav_ASR	and she's gonna get away
71-2_3010.96_1.49.wav_ASR	so she makes it around the corner
71-2_3012.45_3.64.wav_ASR	and immediately it happens
71-2_3016.65_9.027.wav_ASR	the the ball dress is transformed back into her rag
71-2_3025.677_7.746.wav_ASR	the pumpkin luckily she didn't get in it because i don't know what would happen if she were actually inside the pumpkin
71-2_3033.917_1.461.wav_ASR	it's gone
71-2_3035.637_0.493.wav_ASR	slipper
71-2_3036.697_2.343.wav_ASR	and the horses are gone
71-2_3039.7_1.22.wav_ASR	they're rats again
71-2_3041.9_5.82.wav_ASR	so she walks home sweeps in the back because you know they don't really care what she's doing
71-2_3047.96_2.44.wav_ASR	but she could be out in the the barn or whatever
71-2_3051.18_1.98.wav_ASR	and she remembers her mom
71-2_3053.64_0.44.wav_ASR	and she said
71-2_3054.52_2.96.wav_ASR	hey i got to see what it was like to be on the other side of it
71-2_3058.28_1.562.wav_ASR	oh maybe i can be confident
71-2_3059.842_2.694.wav_ASR	or maybe they're some other way that i can get out of here
71-2_3062.542_1.178.wav_ASR	at least i had
71-2_3064.362_9.62.wav_ASR	least i know that if i had the operation close i could walk into a situation at that level and i could
71-2_3075.322_2.431.wav_ASR	one time he's back in the palace
71-2_3078.142_1.402.wav_ASR	he's chasing after her
71-2_3079.8_11.914.wav_ASR	it's you know kind of the the cycle of of what's going on in his brain is getting all these women are throwing them some stuff at him that all this one is playing hard to get because she left
71-2_3092.42_1.26.wav_ASR	so there's kind of a mystery there
71-2_3093.8_0.92.wav_ASR	he's stuck the shoe
71-2_3095.48_0.44.wav_ASR	and he said
71-2_3096.62_2.419.wav_ASR	oh i want that woman
71-2_3099.039_1.554.wav_ASR	and he sees that to his father
71-2_3101.459_0.874.wav_ASR	well i will get married
71-2_3102.659_1.457.wav_ASR	oh i'll do everything you want me to do
71-2_3104.319_1.26.wav_ASR	feel feel my body
71-2_3106.019_2.317.wav_ASR	but i'm only gonna marry a woman i wanna be with
71-2_3108.479_1.188.wav_ASR	and i'd decided who it is
71-2_3109.899_0.481.wav_ASR	it's her
71-2_3110.579_0.492.wav_ASR	the prince
71-2_3111.559_1.82.wav_ASR	the mystery woman
71-2_3113.739_1.359.wav_ASR	and i've got her shoe
71-2_3115.098_9.104.wav_ASR	so all i hafta do now is go around and see if i can figure out who's fit to fit into that shoe
71-2_3124.478_2.226.wav_ASR	and then that will be the person
71-2_3126.704_14.559.wav_ASR	because he's beginning to understand in his mind that there are some limitations of this situation which is that they're human beings that pronounce their social status and how much money they make
71-2_3141.263_17.44.wav_ASR	and he's beginning to think if their their souls could just they could just be soulmates that that would be something that it could wish for of what their initial position in surprise was
71-2_3158.75_4.86.wav_ASR	so he's thinking at this point he's thinking much more badly than his father is
71-2_3163.91_2.82.wav_ASR	and so they've got this this this bar
71-2_3167.87_7.62.wav_ASR	if he can find a woman who's fit fit into those clothes he will know who that person is
71-2_3175.61_0.918.wav_ASR	and then help it her
71-2_3176.528_4.36.wav_ASR	and he'll be able to know that that's the person that's true
71-2_3181.928_1.599.wav_ASR	and that's the person that he will be
71-2_3184.23_8.169.wav_ASR	because the way decide works is if if you're rich you can marry down but but it hasta be their choice
71-2_3192.59_7.512.wav_ASR	if you're poor and you wanna marry up you're gonna be too good as some kind of social climbers
71-2_3200.21_5.812.wav_ASR	so you pretty much need someone to reach down in some way
71-2_3207.09_0.38.wav_ASR	so
71-2_3208.27_0.924.wav_ASR	he's male
71-2_3209.37_0.56.wav_ASR	and she's scared
71-2_3210.23_5.02.wav_ASR	and giving the paper limit limits of them she doesn't get to ask him
71-2_3215.67_1.58.wav_ASR	he hasta ask her
71-2_3217.53_2.64.wav_ASR	and this is the goes back two hundred years
71-2_3220.23_10.62.wav_ASR	and this is the way in which year ago they decide too their department until of what people could actually do
71-2_3232.95_1.66.wav_ASR	so he's going around
71-2_3234.63_9.058.wav_ASR	and of course this is clearly a really interesting way to find the part that he's actually looking for the mystery woman who got away
71-2_3244.37_1.53.wav_ASR	but he's no else what to do
71-2_3246.27_1.395.wav_ASR	and he's aggravated
71-2_3248.05_0.952.wav_ASR	just the one i want
71-2_3249.19_4.215.wav_ASR	who saw the woman you know with the the great carriage
71-2_3253.405_1.7.wav_ASR	and he's called this to check it
71-2_3255.445_1.264.wav_ASR	everybody's looking for
71-2_3256.825_0.684.wav_ASR	they can't find her
71-2_3258.025_3.705.wav_ASR	so we're gonna start with the the shoe because he's got something in front of him
71-2_3262.625_10.345.wav_ASR	and they apologize that he will be going city to city seeing if a woman would come forward to see if he can find the woman that will fit the shoe
71-2_3273.59_2.54.wav_ASR	so of course the stepdaughters
71-2_3276.77_4.492.wav_ASR	he he passes this by the night of the ball
71-2_3281.67_5.34.wav_ASR	but all we gotta do at this point is get our feet to fit into that shoe
71-2_3287.15_7.66.wav_ASR	and of course they're looking at this in a really superficial kind of way because he knows that as soon as he finds the right woman
71-2_3298.01_6.16.wav_ASR	and clearly even if those shoes didn't fit the stepdaughters it wouldn't match
71-2_3304.47_1.08.wav_ASR	they've been no
71-2_3305.92_1.24.wav_ASR	they've been no campus
71-2_3307.5_1.43.wav_ASR	but you know they don't understand that
71-2_3309.14_4.5.wav_ASR	they're really behind in terms of understanding human relationships
71-2_3314.91_9.46.wav_ASR	firstnamec is she knows if she has the opportunity to connect with him again he can take her out of the situation that she's in
71-2_3324.63_1.94.wav_ASR	and they did connect
71-2_3326.99_0.66.wav_ASR	they should know
71-2_3327.87_0.666.wav_ASR	but they did
71-2_3328.77_1.6.wav_ASR	it was very important
71-2_3331.15_16.88.wav_ASR	but for whatever reason because of the fairy godmother she's she's been given that opportunity to step out of her role and move into the the princess
71-2_3349.85_4.94.wav_ASR	so when they come up to the house both of the stepdaughters go
71-2_3355.33_3.9.wav_ASR	may try very hard to see if their feet will fit into the shoe
71-2_3359.65_1.118.wav_ASR	and they they don't
71-2_3361.07_2.251.wav_ASR	they're doing everything that he can
71-2_3363.39_2.46.wav_ASR	and at this point the prince is just very distressed
71-2_3366.67_1.663.wav_ASR	just doesn't think he's ever gonna find her again
71-2_3368.45_4.78.wav_ASR	and he'll be stuck with somebody else that her father will probably arrange for him
71-2_3374.21_1.02.wav_ASR	and he finally said
71-2_3375.45_9.07.wav_ASR	they're any other woman in this house who could possibly be eligible for this
71-2_3385.34_2.26.wav_ASR	and cinderella steps before
71-2_3388.1_5.46.wav_ASR	and this is the braveest thing she's ever done because her stepmother is just gonna punish her for this after
71-2_3394.22_0.66.wav_ASR	and she said
71-2_3395.354_0.61.wav_ASR	five i'm here
71-2_3396.64_1.68.wav_ASR	and the stepmother turns and looks at it
71-2_3398.32_11.3.wav_ASR	and she's ready to you know clearily to punish her and and balance her out to the barn prevent her not to eat for awhile and really really make her life miserable
71-2_3410.66_4.26.wav_ASR	but the person that's working with the prince says
71-2_3415.8_1.04.wav_ASR	he said everybody
71-2_3417.006_1.52.wav_ASR	umbrella umbrella
71-2_3419.206_5.75.wav_ASR	and she steps forward to figure the fact that she's being glare at by the family member
71-2_3426.49_1.26.wav_ASR	and she sits down
71-2_3428.266_4.56.wav_ASR	and her foot fits the shoe
71-2_3433.786_1.224.wav_ASR	the prince looks at her
71-2_3435.486_0.884.wav_ASR	their eyes meet
71-2_3437.19_5.92.wav_ASR	and once again he's he's wet his
71-2_3444.51_11.84.wav_ASR	and at that point all of the power that the prince has to be able to protect her from her stepmother is kind of unfair
71-2_3457.31_6.494.wav_ASR	all of her beautiful clothes come back though we're beginning to think this might've been an illusion in the first place
71-2_3465.03_1.22.wav_ASR	the stepmother says
71-2_3467.17_0.966.wav_ASR	he's out of my hand
71-2_3468.27_3.048.wav_ASR	but i had no ability to understand her anymore
71-2_3471.91_15.74.wav_ASR	and the prince pulls her out of there and brings her back to the palace where she will be grown to be a much higher status than she has been
71-2_3488.11_2.18.wav_ASR	and she's gonna hafta learn how to man
71-2_3490.38_2.51.wav_ASR	her she's gonna learn how to talk
71-2_3493.22_6.463.wav_ASR	but she's gonna hafta learn how to contribute as a lady
71-2_3500.06_5.22.wav_ASR	all the things that are associated associated with a higher social class
71-2_3505.28_7.11.wav_ASR	but but because they connect at a human level this is gonna work
71-2_3569.68_4.16.wav_ASR	was just thinking about telling you about the one i told you last
71-2_3574.16_1.744.wav_ASR	so i hafta come up with the new one and that
71-2_3575.904_16.746.wav_ASR	when i was in the third grade which means i was about eight i was very good with being able to read a class
71-2_3594.17_4.66.wav_ASR	but there were some deals that i was not completely clear about
71-2_3599.49_5.1.wav_ASR	and one of those is what's a quarter after on a clock
71-2_3606.01_7.8.wav_ASR	mean i certainly knew that the short hand or hand was the hour
71-2_3614.27_3.18.wav_ASR	and the long hand was the minister
71-2_3618.41_10.9.wav_ASR	but for my protection from my in my eight year old brain when someone said twenty five after or a quarter after it went twenty
71-2_3629.95_0.94.wav_ASR	didn't mean fifteen
71-2_3632.237_7.116.wav_ASR	and what had happened as my older sister was had stayed home sick that day
71-2_3640.43_4.54.wav_ASR	and i was sposta go to her elementary school teacher
71-2_3645.277_2.053.wav_ASR	and she was in the fifth grade
71-2_3647.95_6.86.wav_ASR	and i was sposta get her home home work and bring it home to her so that she could return to the next day
71-2_3655.69_1.8.wav_ASR	and so i went to my teacher and said
71-2_3657.81_4.4.wav_ASR	and i'm sposta go to milo's feeder
71-2_3662.55_3.64.wav_ASR	and i'm sposta pick up my sisters' home
71-2_3667.09_0.66.wav_ASR	and she said
71-2_3668.13_1.372.wav_ASR	why didn't you go at court after
71-2_3669.502_1.648.wav_ASR	so i said
71-2_3671.37_0.632.wav_ASR	okay i will
71-2_3672.79_7.687.wav_ASR	and i thought quarter after was twenty five minutes after because in my mind that's what made sense
71-2_3680.63_1.36.wav_ASR	the quarter is twenty five minutes
71-2_3682.55_2.16.wav_ASR	it's a quarter it's worth twenty five cents
71-2_3685.29_6.464.wav_ASR	so careful after would be three twenty five not three fifteen which is what she's saying
71-2_3691.83_1.241.wav_ASR	four cover after the hour
71-2_3693.83_6.8.wav_ASR	so i waited til three twenty five which is five minutes before the school is close
71-2_3701.57_3.218.wav_ASR	it's way too late for me to be doing what i'm sposta be doing
71-2_3704.71_1.76.wav_ASR	and i was sposta do it ten minutes earlier
71-2_3706.77_5.92.wav_ASR	and i'm watching the clock until exactly three twenty five and getting up and going to do what i'm sposta do
71-2_3713.17_1.54.wav_ASR	and i ran home
71-2_3715.13_4.3.wav_ASR	and of course it's a mess because i'm missing the end of my class
71-2_3720.41_4.7.wav_ASR	her glass slipper's glass is crumbling down
71-2_3726.15_4.02.wav_ASR	so i get back to my class probably at three thirty five
71-2_3730.99_3.236.wav_ASR	my teacher is still waiting there because my stuff is still in the desk
71-2_3734.91_1.24.wav_ASR	did you wait so long
71-2_3736.33_0.6.wav_ASR	and she said
71-2_3737.07_2.17.wav_ASR	except when you told me to go
71-2_3739.78_1.66.wav_ASR	you told me to go to kootenay
71-2_3742.38_0.58.wav_ASR	and she said
71-2_3743.24_2.52.wav_ASR	oh no you didn't go til three twenty five
71-2_3746.02_0.42.wav_ASR	and i said
71-2_3746.78_1.46.wav_ASR	but isn't that court off
71-2_3749.18_19.93.wav_ASR	and so at the age of eight i understand finally that when adult say quarter hour and they're journaling or before to a clock that they mean fifteen minutes after an hour and not twenty five minutes after an hour
71-2_3769.95_0.381.wav_ASR	house
71-2_3770.47_0.576.wav_ASR	it's i don't know
71-2_3783.83_0.927.wav_ASR	well tell me
71-2_3784.77_0.667.wav_ASR	and i was eight
71-2_3785.65_0.876.wav_ASR	they still make sense
71-2_3786.87_2.118.wav_ASR	you said you know a quarter after the hour
71-2_3788.988_1.9.wav_ASR	or okay okay
71-2_3791.248_1.687.wav_ASR	they just won't clear about
71-2_3793.668_2.282.wav_ASR	now that i actually talk back
71-2_3796.328_1.262.wav_ASR	mean you know i was in a coma
71-2_3797.748_1.362.wav_ASR	you never talk back to anybody
71-2_3799.368_1.8.wav_ASR	but i was just really confused
71-2_3809.35_6.62.wav_ASR	you think of a good
71-2_3816.149_18.351.wav_ASR	to talk about this story i think i'm going to talk about when i learned how to roast a turkey because at the time when i did it i was asked if i could bake the bird
71-2_3836.08_11.38.wav_ASR	and of course growing up in an eventful family and which we had very very huge things i never made my own thinking dinner by myself
71-2_3847.78_2.32.wav_ASR	my generally we would go to my grandmother's house
71-2_3850.98_1.12.wav_ASR	and she had a little child
71-2_3852.94_2.427.wav_ASR	so hour
71-2_3855.367_3.059.wav_ASR	my my father was the second oldest of that family
71-2_3859.04_2.22.wav_ASR	her job was to bring some pie
71-2_3861.92_7.327.wav_ASR	and usually we would bring something else whether it be spanish or something else bread some
71-2_3869.707_2.393.wav_ASR	we never made the term
71-2_3872.607_2.173.wav_ASR	you were never present for doing any of it
71-2_3874.78_1.654.wav_ASR	and we were talking
71-2_3876.434_0.914.wav_ASR	they've been playing
71-2_3877.82_5.48.wav_ASR	you know i'd hang up with my in the kitchen with the window because they were kind of restricted that
71-2_3883.46_1.96.wav_ASR	the man would be the living room watching football
71-2_3886.28_4.902.wav_ASR	yeah you would just try to do with those jelly
71-2_3891.42_2.44.wav_ASR	but in any case i was by myself
71-2_3893.937_6.46.wav_ASR	oh i think i was a senior in
71-2_3903.017_2.6.wav_ASR	and i was working as a waiter
71-2_3906.217_1.753.wav_ASR	and i didn't have a car
71-2_3909.03_2.46.wav_ASR	and i couldn't get enough time off from work
71-2_3911.917_1.736.wav_ASR	they didn't have enough cinderella there
71-2_3913.653_4.9.wav_ASR	so for whatever reason i hadta work on wednesday before things
71-2_3919.253_1.48.wav_ASR	and i was gonna be dry
71-2_3920.873_2.933.wav_ASR	but i was gonna miss this big family event
71-2_3924.413_4.96.wav_ASR	but i decided that i was still going to make sure that i had the truck
71-2_3929.773_1.74.wav_ASR	but i still had trouble
71-2_3931.715_1.84.wav_ASR	but i still had
71-2_3934.135_1.48.wav_ASR	but i still had trouble
71-2_3935.995_1.437.wav_ASR	and those are the things i liked today
71-2_3937.995_2.438.wav_ASR	so i was gonna go through this because now i'm an adult right
71-2_3940.455_1.144.wav_ASR	and i know how to do all this
71-2_3941.995_1.475.wav_ASR	why should i be able to do it
71-2_3943.535_0.973.wav_ASR	it can't be hard
71-2_3945.135_1.145.wav_ASR	it comes out all the
71-2_3946.495_1.92.wav_ASR	it looks like you turn it over
71-2_3948.615_1.065.wav_ASR	you put the turkey
71-2_3949.895_1.065.wav_ASR	they leave it in for a long
71-2_3951.06_1.38.wav_ASR	five and obviously you pull it
71-2_3952.98_1.427.wav_ASR	and then you eat it right
71-2_3954.407_0.765.wav_ASR	and i can do that
71-2_3956.5_5.3.wav_ASR	so the tuesday before thanksgiving evening after i'm calm
71-2_3962.12_0.88.wav_ASR	and everybody's saying
71-2_3963.12_1.013.wav_ASR	you're not gonna be here
71-2_3964.3_1.612.wav_ASR	can't believe you're not gonna be her
71-2_3965.912_1.841.wav_ASR	and i'm feeling all the pride in all this
71-2_3967.94_2.64.wav_ASR	but i get how i pick up this tree
71-2_3970.948_2.557.wav_ASR	and i don't get a particular big one
71-2_3973.708_0.995.wav_ASR	it's pretty big
71-2_3974.748_3.832.wav_ASR	it's probably twenty pounds which is certainly more than i need
71-2_3979.388_1.599.wav_ASR	but you know i don't know
71-2_3981.128_5.18.wav_ASR	smaller than the one that my family has ever used for thanksgiving
71-2_3986.648_1.44.wav_ASR	so i pick up this
71-2_3989.32_4.94.wav_ASR	after i get home from work on wednesday i pull it out of the fridge
71-2_3994.86_1.6.wav_ASR	you kind of see where i'm going with this
71-2_3997.14_1.16.wav_ASR	and i'm pulling out of the tree
71-2_3998.92_0.655.wav_ASR	and say
71-2_3999.94_8.707.wav_ASR	if i put it in the morning on thursday morning i should be able to eat probably like four o'clock in the afternoon
71-2_4008.6_3.427.wav_ASR	you know and i heard you know how to make pies and all the other stuff
71-2_4012.36_2.28.wav_ASR	and stick it in the
71-2_4015.16_2.54.wav_ASR	and i put tin foil over it
71-2_4018.12_1.74.wav_ASR	and i got the temperature correct
71-2_4020.98_0.76.wav_ASR	and i put it in
71-2_4022.48_2.3.wav_ASR	and you know in the meantime i'm getting really hungry
71-2_4025.22_1.08.wav_ASR	see if the day is going
71-2_4026.96_2.58.wav_ASR	the other seems really good
71-2_4030.16_1.799.wav_ASR	and i've already got the pics that are
71-2_4032.82_2.322.wav_ASR	because i'd have time to bake them
71-2_4035.7_1.44.wav_ASR	and i got home to a lot of food
71-2_4037.36_0.82.wav_ASR	and i'm watching tv
71-2_4038.6_1.326.wav_ASR	and so it's about four o'clock
71-2_4040.14_5.623.wav_ASR	and i invited my next door neighbor to come over and help thank you with me
71-2_4045.6_2.7.wav_ASR	me and i pull out the other
71-2_4048.88_8.18.wav_ASR	one i open the other door pull out the the turkey and take off the tin foil
71-2_4058.22_5.156.wav_ASR	and all of a sudden i notice it's still kinda hard on the top
71-2_4063.76_1.56.wav_ASR	it's
71-2_4065.473_3.02.wav_ASR	and what apparently i didn't understand you hadta tell them
71-2_4068.773_3.506.wav_ASR	and i i didn't know that there's actually a process that yeah
71-2_4072.673_10.555.wav_ASR	so what i have is a turkey which is overcooked on the bottom completely uncooked on the top part of it
71-2_4083.413_1.1.wav_ASR	it's blood everywhere
71-2_4084.791_4.6.wav_ASR	oh you know all these you know when you wake up you're sposta have clear
71-2_4089.731_1.877.wav_ASR	and i'm having blood coming out of it
71-2_4092.3_1.672.wav_ASR	so i've gotten my next door neighbor's name
71-2_4094.631_1.127.wav_ASR	so what are we gonna eat
71-2_4095.771_0.429.wav_ASR	and i said
71-2_4096.271_1.769.wav_ASR	well it looks like it's not done yet
71-2_4098.231_1.569.wav_ASR	and i don't know why he's taking this long
71-2_4101.011_1.629.wav_ASR	and i said
71-2_4103.091_0.989.wav_ASR	well let's just see the pie
71-2_4104.66_1.34.wav_ASR	so i put it back in the umbrella
71-2_4106.3_0.82.wav_ASR	we eat the pie
71-2_4107.6_2.94.wav_ASR	we start eating you know whatever i've got in the house
71-2_4110.92_3.32.wav_ASR	keep opening the other door and checking it
71-2_4114.46_1.1.wav_ASR	oh not done
71-2_4115.9_3.62.wav_ASR	and then finally at this point my my neighbor said
71-2_4119.66_2.687.wav_ASR	you know i'm not really hungry anymore because we've been eating
71-2_4122.347_5.32.wav_ASR	and i pick i had some mackinaw and cheese and the refrigerator
71-2_4127.947_0.653.wav_ASR	we eating that
71-2_4128.987_0.853.wav_ASR	they already had the pop
71-2_4130.887_1.513.wav_ASR	you know we eating other stuff
71-2_4132.587_2.053.wav_ASR	they're drinking and being pretty much at that point
71-2_4135.127_1.673.wav_ASR	and it still wasn't
71-2_4136.987_0.32.wav_ASR	what is it
71-2_4137.427_1.789.wav_ASR	think they're something wrong with my elbow
71-2_4139.216_4.64.wav_ASR	for whatever reason this bird did not quit
71-2_4144.716_6.64.wav_ASR	so basically i finally took it out of the elevator
71-2_4152.1_1.576.wav_ASR	it was half o'clock
71-2_4154.1_6.54.wav_ASR	and then i found out the next day from my aunt that it was probably three or four days in advance
71-2_4161.66_3.14.wav_ASR	that's that's the only way that it's cooked even
71-2_4164.8_10.968.wav_ASR	me and i never told anybody other than my aunt that the reason that my turkey did not work out is not because i forgot the thought
71-2_4175.98_2.66.wav_ASR	but because i told you the evil just didn't work
71-2_4178.98_0.94.wav_ASR	that's the
71-2_4180.26_1.499.wav_ASR	that's the one i went with right
71-2_4181.86_0.46.wav_ASR	and i did not
71-2_4182.62_1.64.wav_ASR	they would've laughed at me for ever
71-2_4184.269_5.704.wav_ASR	or they've retired me for decades for not knowing something as basic as that
71-2_4190.749_3.091.wav_ASR	but it's the first bird i ever tried to
71-2_4194.709_2.56.wav_ASR	there's there's you needta tell you the details
71-2_4197.749_2.931.wav_ASR	maybe there's more involved than just sticking in the
71-2_4201.309_1.4.wav_ASR	so anyway yeah
71-2_4202.869_1.276.wav_ASR	well i didn't even tell you
71-2_4204.145_0.66.wav_ASR	but i didn't take it
71-2_4205.385_11.22.wav_ASR	the neck was actually inside paper and was stuck inside the tree which i didn't even know because it was too frozen
71-2_4217.465_4.355.wav_ASR	so when i finally was able to get it out i had paper in there too on top
71-2_4222.245_1.467.wav_ASR	kind of mad
71-2_4223.712_2.033.wav_ASR	especially i ate it
71-2_4225.772_5.36.wav_ASR	and i i just hacked it up then kinda took it
71-2_4231.613_1.392.wav_ASR	but i use it all
71-2_4244.36_0.39.wav_ASR	let's see
71-2_4246.12_3.22.wav_ASR	oh okay
71-2_4250.31_12.91.wav_ASR	and going to talk about hotel that i stayed in when i was living in kootenay and was traveling with five other people
71-2_4263.273_6.26.wav_ASR	now in this particular case what had happened as we were on christmas break
71-2_4270.133_3.68.wav_ASR	so we had a month off in which they were no class
71-2_4274.793_1.429.wav_ASR	and so all of us
71-2_4276.413_2.08.wav_ASR	we're about twenty five of us there
71-2_4278.663_5.439.wav_ASR	we were between the ages of nineteen and twenty one and were in your
71-2_4284.483_8.28.wav_ASR	and we have the ability to be able to buy you rail pass which which means unlimited travel
71-2_4293.323_0.72.wav_ASR	you're basically
71-2_4294.543_3.437.wav_ASR	can i can't remember what it's called at this point
71-2_4297.98_2.54.wav_ASR	but i think it was about a hundred dollars you pay
71-2_4300.82_16.44.wav_ASR	you could especially go anywhere anywhere as far as free as free norm as long as it was on this this rail
71-2_4317.626_3.34.wav_ASR	so you know we had all these ways of trying to do it chief
71-2_4321.286_2.024.wav_ASR	you know we'd sleep on on train
71-2_4323.546_4.404.wav_ASR	we would take things at night so that we wouldn't hafta worry about a
71-2_4328.866_1.9.wav_ASR	but we were now
71-2_4331.086_2.44.wav_ASR	we were several of us that were traveling
71-2_4333.686_1.58.wav_ASR	it was with a friend called firstnamek
71-2_4335.298_4.36.wav_ASR	and we were connecting in with firstnamej and firstnamec
71-2_4339.721_2.975.wav_ASR	and and we were they were coming
71-2_4342.838_1.313.wav_ASR	they traveled from somewhere
71-2_4344.198_2.045.wav_ASR	we're all gonna meet together in room
71-2_4346.718_4.949.wav_ASR	and we figure we would all stay in a hotel together to stay money you know
71-2_4351.738_2.52.wav_ASR	we would have two
71-2_4354.57_1.472.wav_ASR	so there was a cat
71-2_4356.47_1.518.wav_ASR	and one of us would sleep with firstnamek
71-2_4357.988_3.735.wav_ASR	and and then two women would be in the other the other
71-2_4362.65_1.8.wav_ASR	so it's new york city right
71-2_4364.61_1.672.wav_ASR	because this is christmas break
71-2_4366.73_2.06.wav_ASR	we arrive in
71-2_4369.51_2.46.wav_ASR	and the first thing we we would do when

71-2_4376.45_1.74.wav_ASR	we all met at the train station
71-2_4378.485_2.025.wav_ASR	we all got in with a half an hour of each other
71-2_4380.725_0.585.wav_ASR	we connect
71-2_4381.31_17.334.wav_ASR	the first thing we would always do is go to the the information center in the train station and get the maps and find out what's going on in the the city and where the chief hotel's are you know basically what we're gonna be able to
71-2_4399.31_1.66.wav_ASR	oh there's a guy there working

71-2_4408.77_2.324.wav_ASR	well he was just starting flooding with us too
71-2_4410.93_1.58.wav_ASR	so they're three average women
71-2_4412.97_0.805.wav_ASR	there's one guy
71-2_4414.09_1.187.wav_ASR	he's traveling with us

71-2_4426.362_1.68.wav_ASR	we're open to any experience
71-2_4428.462_0.4.wav_ASR	he said

71-2_4440.046_0.685.wav_ASR	it's nice
71-2_4440.731_1.855.wav_ASR	we loved to go to an italian party
71-2_4442.966_1.106.wav_ASR	and yeah
71-2_4444.486_4.06.wav_ASR	have seen the movie the tape and which means it could go very different
71-2_4448.786_0.842.wav_ASR	but that's not what happened
71-2_4450.606_1.32.wav_ASR	so we get to our hotel
71-2_4453.086_0.895.wav_ASR	and we check in
71-2_4454.966_4.62.wav_ASR	the guy behind the desk looked at all of us and said
71-2_4459.59_1.88.wav_ASR	you all wanna be in one room together
71-2_4462.21_0.62.wav_ASR	we said
71-2_4463.448_1.886.wav_ASR	one one two
71-2_4466.53_1.558.wav_ASR	and he looked at firstnamec
71-2_4468.088_2.082.wav_ASR	and and he pulled it aside and said
71-2_4470.79_1.3.wav_ASR	you must not be alert
71-2_4472.41_4.094.wav_ASR	if i were in that room i would not be able to sleep the entire night
71-2_4476.504_3.19.wav_ASR	they're tired night with all of these beautiful women around
71-2_4480.57_2.338.wav_ASR	and he hadn't come out yet
71-2_4482.944_3.806.wav_ASR	but about a year later after that when we all had a reunion
71-2_4487.104_0.926.wav_ASR	you know i'm i'm gay
71-2_4488.81_0.614.wav_ASR	and i said
71-2_4489.544_1.514.wav_ASR	oh we we didn't know that
71-2_4491.584_4.638.wav_ASR	yeah then i was thinking at the time you know he he actually didn't know he was gay
71-2_4496.25_7.099.wav_ASR	but he said one of the things that made clear to him that he was gay as when that animal man had said
71-2_4504.19_3.358.wav_ASR	we wouldn't be able to sleep if i were in the room with these beautiful women
71-2_4508.07_0.96.wav_ASR	and he was thinking
71-2_4509.29_1.838.wav_ASR	you know i'm not interested in anything
71-2_4511.51_1.94.wav_ASR	and eventually bought it
71-2_4513.97_1.867.wav_ASR	well maybe there's a reason for that
71-2_4515.85_1.695.wav_ASR	yeah but i don't know
71-2_4518.19_2.637.wav_ASR	so we we actually stopped with firstnamek
71-2_4520.91_0.704.wav_ASR	that was
71-2_4523.37_1.48.wav_ASR	and i mean there was no
71-2_4525.51_3.045.wav_ASR	it didn't matter who we're gonna sleep with
71-2_4528.59_1.436.wav_ASR	he was like my brother at that point
71-2_4530.79_1.74.wav_ASR	so firstnamek and i sleep in one bed
71-2_4532.73_0.64.wav_ASR	it was a dog
71-2_4533.83_2.42.wav_ASR	and sandi and firstnamek sleep in the other one
71-2_4536.43_6.242.wav_ASR	and we put all our stuff up you know our back packs and our sleeping bags
71-2_4542.95_1.454.wav_ASR	and we all went to this party
71-2_4544.65_2.441.wav_ASR	everybody's really well dressed at this party
71-2_4547.69_2.18.wav_ASR	they were jeans
71-2_4558.543_1.81.wav_ASR	everybody's all mad
71-2_4560.543_2.446.wav_ASR	they're we're looking like we look
71-2_4563.963_5.82.wav_ASR	and the whole thing at the party became the focus of
71-2_4569.795_5.22.wav_ASR	so this guy is sleeping with all three of you in the hotel
71-2_4575.455_8.129.wav_ASR	well that's all we talked about all night long was just that firstnamek had three different women that he was having sex with
71-2_4583.835_2.445.wav_ASR	and so you know but
71-2_4586.535_3.105.wav_ASR	well i could be an emergency man and travel with three weeks
71-2_4589.64_1.073.wav_ASR	and you know
71-2_4591.62_1.186.wav_ASR	her knee was so miserable
71-2_4593.08_2.472.wav_ASR	oh oh better by the whole thing
71-2_4595.68_0.879.wav_ASR	we
71-2_4597.78_4.75.wav_ASR	what's interesting is on the way back we stopped again in the the bathroom
71-2_4602.76_3.63.wav_ASR	firstnamec came out of the barn the men's bathroom and said
71-2_4607.06_1.72.wav_ASR	just had the train's account
71-2_4609.0_0.74.wav_ASR	and we go
71-2_4609.96_0.5.wav_ASR	happy
71-2_4610.475_1.125.wav_ASR	he said
71-2_4611.66_1.84.wav_ASR	oh i was at the you know
71-2_4614.02_1.751.wav_ASR	and i was starting
71-2_4615.94_0.733.wav_ASR	and i was pain
71-2_4617.72_1.59.wav_ASR	and all of a sudden this man came
71-2_4619.54_4.24.wav_ASR	he he could have gone to the other side of the road
71-2_4624.08_1.411.wav_ASR	came and stood right next to me
71-2_4626.74_0.6.wav_ASR	and he said
71-2_4627.405_1.298.wav_ASR	and i don't know what that means
71-2_4628.703_0.68.wav_ASR	and it's like
71-2_4630.703_0.392.wav_ASR	oh maybe
71-2_4631.095_1.208.wav_ASR	yeah it's a terrible you know
71-2_4632.523_0.44.wav_ASR	he says
71-2_4633.223_4.051.wav_ASR	well he had the biggest pain i'd ever seen
71-2_4637.563_0.429.wav_ASR	oh
71-2_4638.163_1.275.wav_ASR	so somehow
71-2_4640.283_2.322.wav_ASR	thinking about that a year later at kind of made sense
71-2_4642.723_0.997.wav_ASR	that's the time i had it
71-2_4643.84_0.556.wav_ASR	five i don't know
71-2_4644.543_1.18.wav_ASR	he's this is what it tell me
71-2_4645.732_10.149.wav_ASR	we just thought atlanta men were so strange that somebody they would not be able to sleep in a a full load of women and not be able to sleep when he's exhausted because
71-2_4656.872_1.771.wav_ASR	but i could not sleep if i were in that room
71-2_4658.952_2.411.wav_ASR	just couldn't imagine all those women around him
71-2_4661.432_1.043.wav_ASR	we were sharing a boat
71-2_4663.072_0.5.wav_ASR	oh my
71-2_4663.885_1.9.wav_ASR	oh anyway yeah
71-2_4665.989_3.342.wav_ASR	that's better than the one where i hadta say
71-2_4669.685_0.92.wav_ASR	you have anvacation
71-2_4670.828_2.306.wav_ASR	which is what i tell you last week
71-2_4673.345_2.38.wav_ASR	but i don't have a lot of trouble
71-2_4676.085_0.796.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
71-2_4677.505_0.76.wav_ASR	that was nice
71-2_4683.67_0.73.wav_ASR	thank you
71-2_4684.79_1.88.wav_ASR	we've already talked about my okay
71-2_4687.29_1.19.wav_ASR	so i come up with the different one
71-2_4688.98_22.04.wav_ASR	and i useta have this thing that i would do to family members and friends which involved involving them in restaurants on their holiday
71-2_4711.28_5.98.wav_ASR	and what i would do is i would usually go quiet
71-2_4718.12_0.593.wav_ASR	and i've get up
71-2_4718.88_1.542.wav_ASR	and i would excuse myself in the table
71-2_4720.7_0.485.wav_ASR	and i would go
71-2_4721.32_1.92.wav_ASR	and i would talk to a waitress
71-2_4723.38_1.18.wav_ASR	and i would say something like
71-2_4724.78_0.758.wav_ASR	it's my cousin
71-2_4725.64_1.14.wav_ASR	it's his birthday today
71-2_4727.48_2.1.wav_ASR	he doesn't like anything at all
71-2_4729.698_4.925.wav_ASR	and so is they're only important in time in which you could bring us a cat
71-2_4734.623_3.695.wav_ASR	and then we could really appreciate him by singing really lovely oh
71-2_4738.31_3.62.wav_ASR	and usually the weather's all like
71-2_4742.318_0.971.wav_ASR	we didn't love it
71-2_4743.298_0.762.wav_ASR	that would be fine
71-2_4744.738_1.792.wav_ASR	so i had this thing about doing that
71-2_4746.63_5.9.wav_ASR	and very often i would bring my own clothes the kind that don't bluntn
71-2_4752.99_5.848.wav_ASR	the oh they they repeat because then you can really really believe people
71-2_4758.97_1.497.wav_ASR	yeah that was my place

71-2_4764.86_4.14.wav_ASR	and his relaxation with his golf friend had just ended
71-2_4769.48_3.76.wav_ASR	he's always kind of quiet and and shy
71-2_4774.06_7.648.wav_ASR	so i decided that what we should really do is we should call a lot of attention to him because this would be good for him
71-2_4782.483_4.66.wav_ASR	so they were about fifteen of us there in the family
71-2_4787.403_2.28.wav_ASR	we were all sitting in the same
71-2_4790.743_1.267.wav_ASR	we were in the same boat
71-2_4792.783_6.78.wav_ASR	but i decided that that would actually aid to the end if we had people singing from a distance around him
71-2_4800.425_7.26.wav_ASR	oh i i took my niece and nephew with me to talk to the waitress staff
71-2_4808.085_1.875.wav_ASR	and firstnamem was then six

71-2_4965.96_1.081.wav_ASR	and i get to remember that
71-2_4967.18_0.36.wav_ASR	and i said
71-2_4967.76_1.097.wav_ASR	was it a surprise
71-2_4968.88_0.538.wav_ASR	he says
71-2_4969.54_2.689.wav_ASR	it was not the surprise when i heard firstnamem say
71-2_4972.7_2.78.wav_ASR	remember to sing very very loud
71-2_4976.56_11.193.wav_ASR	so you know i i think i handled the workplace i think i gave her twenty dollars or something what she had done because she carried it off so well
71-2_4988.7_0.52.wav_ASR	yeah
71-2_4989.46_1.132.wav_ASR	it was so much fun
71-2_4990.7_0.32.wav_ASR	and she said
71-2_4991.1_1.881.wav_ASR	it's oh much fun
71-2_4992.981_3.44.wav_ASR	and and she just looked at me and just
71-2_4998.102_3.085.wav_ASR	well alright yeah anyway that was fine
71-2_5001.681_0.427.wav_ASR	that is
71-2_5016.87_9.94.wav_ASR	back in the days when i would make peanut butter and jelly sandwich because of course i can't anymore for all sorts of reasons
71-2_5026.95_5.193.wav_ASR	slap it's saturday night too much shoe and all the rest of it
71-2_5032.23_5.632.wav_ASR	but back in the days when i would have done this oh what would i've started out with the bread
71-2_5038.61_13.295.wav_ASR	and i would've toasted it because the text text of toast works better for me than it comes to peanut butter when it comes to peanut butter and jelly
71-2_5052.65_3.64.wav_ASR	so i would begin by putting it in the toaster
71-2_5056.23_6.16.wav_ASR	and while it's tossing up i would pull out the peanut butter and the jelly
71-2_5063.89_6.546.wav_ASR	when the bread comes out of the toaster i would begin with the peanut butter
71-2_5070.71_0.899.wav_ASR	goes on the bike
71-2_5071.89_4.232.wav_ASR	but i would do with knife as i would pull out some peanut butter
71-2_5076.47_2.8.wav_ASR	and i would spread it evenly on the bread
71-2_5079.93_2.64.wav_ASR	then i would take the other piece of toast
71-2_5083.17_7.54.wav_ASR	and i would take a spoon and spoon out some jelly
71-2_5091.25_1.174.wav_ASR	write it around even
71-2_5093.29_1.54.wav_ASR	and then put the two of them together
71-2_5095.33_3.74.wav_ASR	and probably slice it before eating
71-2_5100.37_1.46.wav_ASR	and i don't eat anything like that anymore
71-2_5102.25_1.58.wav_ASR	that's how i would do it
71-2_5111.35_0.5.wav_ASR	oh
71-2_5112.173_4.003.wav_ASR	well i think we talk about this last week
71-2_5116.353_4.662.wav_ASR	and i've not done my laundry since last week which means i really needta do it at this point
71-2_5122.17_24.64.wav_ASR	when i do laundry what i'm able to do is not separate them separate them from color and white because i've gone to the point that i only buy clothes that can all be washed in cold water which is also much better for the environment
71-2_5147.64_14.38.wav_ASR	so all of my childhood is already put aside because as close as they end up in my
71-2_5163.84_1.68.wav_ASR	so when it's time to do laundry
71-2_5205.68_2.96.wav_ASR	my plan is probably too hard
71-2_5208.96_5.54.wav_ASR	have a break between two different appointments that will allow me to do that
71-2_5214.8_4.46.wav_ASR	what i'm going to do is i'll pull into the laundry which is on the east west
71-2_5221.0_3.28.wav_ASR	oh i think it's about twenty one hundred
71-2_5224.612_5.38.wav_ASR	and i will walk into a medical side wash washing machines
71-2_5230.452_2.529.wav_ASR	and i would put all of my laundry in
71-2_5233.212_2.606.wav_ASR	well i will not separate it by color or white
71-2_5236.572_4.435.wav_ASR	and i will then add the soup at the top of it
71-2_5241.89_6.96.wav_ASR	then i will put in enough quarters to be able to begin the cycle
71-2_5249.67_3.44.wav_ASR	and i will wash on my clothes on car
71-2_5253.83_7.3.wav_ASR	after the courts are in i put the cold water water
71-2_5261.412_5.86.wav_ASR	and then i take note of the fact that it will take twenty five minutes for it to walk
71-2_5300.51_7.94.wav_ASR	because it's tubes and wires and things that will take longer to to drive
71-2_5309.73_7.36.wav_ASR	and then i threw it all back in the hamper and take it home and then sometime's unknown fold it or put it away
71-2_5317.17_8.72.wav_ASR	and sometimes i just take right out of the clean hamper and put it on my my my my body or my bed or whatever i need it
71-2_5335.726_1.6.wav_ASR	thank you
71-2_5338.086_0.904.wav_ASR	well i've never done that
71-2_5339.206_1.26.wav_ASR	and i have tried
71-2_5341.05_1.916.wav_ASR	we'll make very clear that i have tried
71-2_5343.826_8.14.wav_ASR	and have not ever suggested in doing so for different reasons
71-2_5352.99_2.016.wav_ASR	if i wanted to do it correct
71-2_5355.43_3.92.wav_ASR	and and this is what it says on the
71-2_5360.33_1.64.wav_ASR	which has never worked for me
71-2_5362.41_2.88.wav_ASR	but this is especially the way that we would do it
71-2_5365.51_1.04.wav_ASR	and i would get
71-2_5368.81_1.36.wav_ASR	or i would get
71-2_5370.83_2.38.wav_ASR	and i would go to a plant
71-2_5374.88_3.677.wav_ASR	and there's one that's about a mile and half of where i live
71-2_5378.64_3.28.wav_ASR	and you buy a special type of
71-2_5384.1_1.523.wav_ASR	it it comes in a bag
71-2_5385.8_1.105.wav_ASR	and i think it's it's
71-2_5387.32_6.933.wav_ASR	well i know it's it's it's awful enough that you should be able to grow things on it
71-2_5394.253_3.88.wav_ASR	and i would put this into a pot
71-2_5398.493_12.547.wav_ASR	and i would make sure that there was a hole in it for leave so that if you put the water in the water it should be able to drain out into a tray
71-2_5412.06_6.94.wav_ASR	put the pot near a window so that there's enough
71-2_5420.54_3.72.wav_ASR	and what i would do is make sure that the
71-2_5424.56_4.012.wav_ASR	the first i would read the documents on the seat package which i've done before
71-2_5429.36_2.358.wav_ASR	you hafta go down about two inches
71-2_5431.718_2.05.wav_ASR	you take a seed
71-2_5434.438_1.243.wav_ASR	you place it
71-2_5436.118_0.689.wav_ASR	you cook
71-2_5437.218_1.782.wav_ASR	you water it
71-2_5439.278_1.558.wav_ASR	and then you leave it alone
71-2_5441.258_2.82.wav_ASR	especially nurse takes it's course
71-2_5444.438_5.88.wav_ASR	in my particular situation one time i didn't have enough sun
71-2_5451.69_10.26.wav_ASR	another time i simply overwatered it to the point that the soil was so saturated that the seed
71-2_5463.05_8.069.wav_ASR	and i think the other time it was too cold in my apartment to be able to struggle in the way that it was sposta
71-2_5471.119_2.542.wav_ASR	but i've seen other people do it
71-2_5473.819_1.78.wav_ASR	and i know the process exactly
71-2_5475.839_4.031.wav_ASR	and i've just been able to actually do it in a way that makes it actually work
71-2_5480.75_10.703.wav_ASR	so yeah i'm still in the temporary state of staying up of stage of understanding of what you're sposta be able to do
71-2_5491.453_11.589.wav_ASR	but i haven't yet figured out how to keep the soil dry enough so that it it can spread without me overheating it to the point that i rot it
71-2_5503.85_5.443.wav_ASR	so i think there's a balance i haven't yet achieved to be able to do it
84-1_17.07_2.48.wav_ASR	and i would hafta say one of my favorite treats
84-1_19.816_4.091.wav_ASR	my wife and i have two sons that are older now
84-1_24.096_5.94.wav_ASR	and for a number of years we went skiing in utah in park city
84-1_31.276_2.24.wav_ASR	and i really enjoyed the operation
84-1_33.838_6.2.wav_ASR	so my younger was probably about three years old and my oldest was probably
84-1_40.738_1.181.wav_ASR	oh it's probably a little bit
84-1_42.198_2.46.wav_ASR	five and
84-1_45.878_4.42.wav_ASR	and it was just so much fun to get out there and and
84-1_50.529_3.88.wav_ASR	but i i could ski already but my two kids
84-1_55.149_1.45.wav_ASR	my wife sleep a little bit
84-1_56.809_3.24.wav_ASR	my two kids became pretty good scared
84-1_60.329_3.354.wav_ASR	pretty sure that a lot of them was
84-1_63.693_8.407.wav_ASR	we we had a guy when we were in in in
84-1_72.333_1.915.wav_ASR	just lost the name of the place
84-1_74.633_3.58.wav_ASR	and when we were in the united states
84-1_78.653_2.88.wav_ASR	and we were glad with him for a number of years
84-1_81.538_1.66.wav_ASR	he did a really good job
84-1_83.198_9.633.wav_ASR	well i hope that will give you a little bit of sense of how much i enjoy skiing with them while when i could
84-1_100.218_1.397.wav_ASR	it it was very nice
84-1_127.149_12.52.wav_ASR	well i just got accepted to be part of the bar again in philadelphia
84-1_141.089_3.08.wav_ASR	my my skills
84-1_144.711_5.549.wav_ASR	my i i i think my skills are pretty good
84-1_150.311_2.822.wav_ASR	they're never gonna be great as they once were
84-1_153.811_8.199.wav_ASR	so i would say on a scale one to ten right now i would say i'm probably as
84-1_162.21_3.04.wav_ASR	so i feel like i've made a lot of progress
84-1_165.81_5.761.wav_ASR	but i know that there's more progress i needta make especially with with big words
84-1_172.07_1.91.wav_ASR	big words can be difficult for me
84-1_174.17_3.53.wav_ASR	so i do see a speech therapist once a week
84-1_177.77_3.733.wav_ASR	but she's been extremely extremely helpful for me
84-1_181.503_0.887.wav_ASR	and i like her
84-1_182.39_6.734.wav_ASR	and i also have some some work out with me
84-1_189.203_1.429.wav_ASR	the two of them are just great
84-1_196.9_1.27.wav_ASR	oh i remember that pretty well
84-1_207.12_2.95.wav_ASR	well my wife was away for the weekend
84-1_210.39_2.78.wav_ASR	we had a house in oklahoma
84-1_214.15_3.64.wav_ASR	and i remember that week end because i hadta work
84-1_217.968_4.82.wav_ASR	and i thought the biggest thing we i could do for the weekend was to stay home
84-1_223.738_8.03.wav_ASR	so i think she probably went down there on maybe wednesday or thursday
84-1_232.508_2.66.wav_ASR	and i came home from work on friday
84-1_236.128_0.848.wav_ASR	and i had dinner
84-1_236.976_0.998.wav_ASR	and i did some work
84-1_238.176_2.0.wav_ASR	and i get up the next morning
84-1_240.536_5.24.wav_ASR	but that was the thirty thirty of
84-1_247.676_1.721.wav_ASR	and i felt pretty good
84-1_249.716_1.188.wav_ASR	and i went about my day
84-1_251.576_2.08.wav_ASR	and i went out for a bicycle ride
84-1_254.296_1.0.wav_ASR	and i came home
84-1_255.22_20.6.wav_ASR	and and that night was the night that oh a week maybe after flood was killed in in minneapolis
84-1_276.504_5.66.wav_ASR	and so on saturday night i went to bed a little bit earlier
84-1_282.524_4.46.wav_ASR	well i i thought they might be some bible
84-1_287.724_3.66.wav_ASR	and i also thought it would be helpful in the mornings
84-1_291.464_1.784.wav_ASR	so i could clean up a little bit
84-1_293.7_2.69.wav_ASR	so we live in a fairly nice area
84-1_297.14_2.43.wav_ASR	and i went to bed around ten thirty
84-1_300.6_5.7.wav_ASR	and that night saturday night there was a lot of violence in in center city
84-1_307.16_3.84.wav_ASR	and i remember that that a building was burned
84-1_315.929_2.242.wav_ASR	and so i got up
84-1_318.529_2.98.wav_ASR	and i i live in a fairly secure place
84-1_322.129_4.884.wav_ASR	and the next morning i got up really early and went outside
84-1_327.229_1.08.wav_ASR	it was a total mess
84-1_329.189_1.324.wav_ASR	so i started cleaning up
84-1_331.129_3.4.wav_ASR	and sometimes during the day i felt a little bit
84-1_334.969_1.819.wav_ASR	so i went back home
84-1_337.0_1.019.wav_ASR	for a little
84-1_338.309_1.26.wav_ASR	went out and got a paper
84-1_340.069_2.184.wav_ASR	and then i felt pretty good for the rest of the day
84-1_342.769_10.717.wav_ASR	and sometimes on that sunday night between may thirti and june first i had my stroke
84-1_354.11_3.04.wav_ASR	and in the morning my wife could not get a hold of me
84-1_357.75_1.397.wav_ASR	so we have a door man here
84-1_359.39_0.831.wav_ASR	he went up
84-1_360.85_1.3.wav_ASR	and i was on the floor
84-1_362.37_2.0.wav_ASR	and so he called an ambulance
84-1_364.67_4.58.wav_ASR	my wife was in oklahoma maryland
84-1_369.477_7.22.wav_ASR	so she was told that i had better that i should that
84-1_377.397_1.08.wav_ASR	yeah bad with pronunciation
84-1_378.897_3.68.wav_ASR	that my wife should come home
84-1_382.428_8.24.wav_ASR	and i have two sons one who's in new york and one who's in san francisco
84-1_391.348_6.86.wav_ASR	and they were told it was probably good idea for them to come home because i wasn't sure what was gonna happen
84-1_398.267_6.5.wav_ASR	and so i remember distinctly that i was brought into the emergency room
84-1_405.227_2.72.wav_ASR	and apparently i i could not say a lot
84-1_407.987_2.86.wav_ASR	my voice was very garbled
84-1_411.47_14.3.wav_ASR	but the end by the end of the session my my wife told me later that she she was not sure what kind of shape i'd be in
84-1_425.77_14.463.wav_ASR	but but the end of the surgery which was i had a blood vessel i was able she thought the surgeon thought that i was going to be able to live
84-1_440.31_3.579.wav_ASR	they didn't know how much exactly i'll be able to do
84-1_444.38_6.0.wav_ASR	so i i spent about six eight weeks in rehab
84-1_451.21_2.29.wav_ASR	and i came out not sure what i could
84-1_453.84_4.18.wav_ASR	so today i i feel pretty good about my voice
84-1_458.6_2.9.wav_ASR	because i said i still feel like there's more i can do
84-1_462.06_4.25.wav_ASR	so as i said i think i'm about seventy percent right now
84-1_478.63_9.28.wav_ASR	well i was in rehab for eight weeks about a place that's about maybe eight blocks from here
84-1_488.29_1.76.wav_ASR	and it was a time when it was cloudy
84-1_490.47_3.04.wav_ASR	so it wasn't really easy for me to see people
84-1_494.13_3.84.wav_ASR	but one of the people where we live
84-1_498.084_2.28.wav_ASR	because i live in high school
84-1_501.2_9.29.wav_ASR	one of the persons was maybe the second or third command at firstnameje which is where i went to for my read
84-1_511.17_8.41.wav_ASR	and this person who's name is firstnamek was allowed they were allowed to get two people in to see me at day
84-1_520.09_3.903.wav_ASR	well i i got to see well my two sisters came in
84-1_524.19_2.789.wav_ASR	and my my children came in
84-1_527.21_2.02.wav_ASR	and then my wife came in
84-1_529.33_4.5.wav_ASR	so i had a very good tree
84-1_534.47_8.45.wav_ASR	and so each day i would have o t p t and speech
84-1_543.73_2.66.wav_ASR	so that was every day except for sunday and sunday
84-1_554.07_3.15.wav_ASR	well what can i do about it
84-1_558.98_2.94.wav_ASR	so i i mean i understand i hadta deal with that
84-1_562.65_2.916.wav_ASR	and didn't always feel with it but i try too
84-1_590.17_3.99.wav_ASR	well i hafta tell you i've had a pretty good life until my stroke
84-1_595.73_3.421.wav_ASR	and i would say that one of the best things that ever happened to me was
84-1_599.151_7.46.wav_ASR	and i was in a program at a school called wesleyan which is in milwaukee kentucky
84-1_607.212_12.7.wav_ASR	and when i was there part of this this program i was in this conference informed it made it so that i hadta spend a semester of
84-1_620.93_9.96.wav_ASR	and during starting in seven grade through high school and then into college i spoke friend friend friend pretty well
84-1_631.61_7.66.wav_ASR	because i had a teacher in in wednesday who was at the time going out with one of the club baseball league
84-1_639.596_3.36.wav_ASR	and so she was friends
84-1_643.098_1.783.wav_ASR	and she useta talk about that a lot
84-1_645.456_2.323.wav_ASR	and so i took a class from her
84-1_648.376_1.811.wav_ASR	and somehow i did pretty well
84-1_650.376_6.36.wav_ASR	so when i when then i was in the program at at westminster
84-1_657.064_3.6.wav_ASR	and i would say one of the happiest ages for me was graduation
84-1_661.59_8.094.wav_ASR	well i i i wound up doing pretty well at the school and even though i had gotten in on a wait list
84-1_670.684_1.52.wav_ASR	it was really exciting
84-1_672.25_9.12.wav_ASR	but i i i knew a bunch of people in my class but i was really close with the class of eighty
84-1_681.67_2.875.wav_ASR	and it was just a fun time for me
84-1_684.545_1.765.wav_ASR	and i was presented to my funeral
84-1_687.01_6.06.wav_ASR	and i i met somebody who became one of my closest friends
84-1_693.27_2.1.wav_ASR	he was the proposed at westminster
84-1_695.55_2.306.wav_ASR	so i it was really nice
84-1_698.38_8.68.wav_ASR	after graduate from high school i spent some vacation with him and some of my roommates
84-1_707.68_2.16.wav_ASR	he he was somewhere who was remarkable
84-1_710.58_2.476.wav_ASR	he went to higher law school
84-1_713.273_5.48.wav_ASR	and at the end of his freshman year he went down one move
84-1_719.733_2.72.wav_ASR	and he went down to the bookstore
84-1_722.973_3.56.wav_ASR	and he bought all the books aboutitalian restaurants
84-1_726.863_7.22.wav_ASR	so he went back to went back to to campus and he changed
84-1_734.443_1.76.wav_ASR	he he was already in a lot of school
84-1_736.563_2.08.wav_ASR	he had been under guard at princess
84-1_739.263_4.24.wav_ASR	and he and he after his first year of being the movie star he said
84-1_743.663_0.992.wav_ASR	it wasn't for me
84-1_744.8_5.82.wav_ASR	and he went to at harbor he went to apraxia's apartment
84-1_756.57_3.48.wav_ASR	yeah i i was really it was a good place for me
84-1_764.754_4.32.wav_ASR	and i haven't been visiting since my stroke
84-1_769.655_5.279.wav_ASR	but you know i useta be fairly involved at the university
84-1_775.834_6.1.wav_ASR	and my younger son went there after spending a year and school
84-1_782.807_7.94.wav_ASR	and he did really well at the school
84-1_790.907_3.04.wav_ASR	so i was very excited for him
84-1_828.61_2.67.wav_ASR	well i happy to know these pictures quite a lot
84-1_832.07_3.18.wav_ASR	it's a story about a kid playing soccer
84-1_836.05_3.3.wav_ASR	and he he he strikes the ball
84-1_839.99_3.52.wav_ASR	went through the window of a neighbor's house
84-1_843.796_24.848.wav_ASR	and it was taken by one of the young or middle age husband or maybe husband or just a regular person who lived in the house
84-1_868.644_20.254.wav_ASR	and and then he looked out the window to see if he could figure out who may have hit hit the soccer ball so that landed on his his not on this lap but on his close to his leg i think
84-1_907.89_1.94.wav_ASR	but this one i'll open no
84-1_909.988_8.342.wav_ASR	it's it's about a young boy who when he went to school he was deciding whether or not to take an umbrella
84-1_918.59_2.6.wav_ASR	he decided not to take the umbrella
84-1_921.69_2.48.wav_ASR	and it turned out that it it started raining
84-1_924.87_1.88.wav_ASR	so he went back home
84-1_926.94_1.818.wav_ASR	and he was soaking wet
84-1_929.34_2.127.wav_ASR	but apparently he changed his clothes
84-1_932.02_5.76.wav_ASR	and he went back outside with a umbrella so that he could get to school
84-1_938.24_6.041.wav_ASR	but i assume he went to school on time but i really don't know whether that's part of the story or not
84-1_957.58_7.15.wav_ASR	so this is a little girl maybe under ten who had a cat who was stuck up in the tree
84-1_965.45_7.58.wav_ASR	so apparently the the dad got off his ladder
84-1_973.283_3.967.wav_ASR	the girl was on a tricycle
84-1_977.59_1.904.wav_ASR	he stopped and looked at the cat
84-1_979.94_19.956.wav_ASR	so the the the the the the the the the the the the the the father went up to get the cat
84-1_999.896_13.754.wav_ASR	and i guess the the ladder got kicked away so that the the the ladder was stuck
84-1_1014.556_2.6.wav_ASR	and the the dog's started barking
84-1_1017.78_2.68.wav_ASR	and eventually the fire department came
84-1_1021.24_0.94.wav_ASR	they were evil
84-1_1022.44_0.5.wav_ASR	preschool
84-1_1023.32_0.654.wav_ASR	don't know
84-1_1024.06_3.563.wav_ASR	but i think they were able to get the cat and get the man down
84-1_1188.54_7.06.wav_ASR	so this is the story about a young woman named cinderella
84-1_1196.189_19.982.wav_ASR	and she was working at a place where there was a a middle age lady and two people who had grown up with her and was interested in trying to get someone to marry them
84-1_1216.59_15.38.wav_ASR	so it turned out that the that there was a young prince who was interested with her with his family
84-1_1232.85_29.52.wav_ASR	and the young prince decided that they should get together and have a ball so that maybe the people the girls were possibly interested in in having a relationship with the prince
84-1_1263.48_2.52.wav_ASR	and i don't remember the name of the prince
84-1_1266.09_4.89.wav_ASR	but so they send her out an invitation to all the people in the community
84-1_1272.04_9.98.wav_ASR	and the two young ladies who lived with her
84-1_1284.38_8.84.wav_ASR	her older mother decided that they would go to the ball and start getting dressed to go to the ball
84-1_1293.98_17.52.wav_ASR	but cinderella who was like a carriage on the property and was stuck doing things like washing clothes and cleaning the floor and stuff like that she found out about their being this
84-1_1312.413_4.54.wav_ASR	and she wanted to know if there was some way she could attend
84-1_1317.593_1.78.wav_ASR	so she
84-1_1320.333_2.28.wav_ASR	they don't remember exactly how it happened
84-1_1323.133_6.02.wav_ASR	but she was able to get in touch with somebody i think they call the fairy
84-1_1330.065_3.52.wav_ASR	and she talked to the fairy godmother
84-1_1334.45_20.985.wav_ASR	and so while the two people from the house were going with her her her older lady to the dance she decided that she could go
84-1_1355.435_4.2.wav_ASR	so she got dressed up and in fancy clothes
84-1_1360.415_5.337.wav_ASR	and she was told by the fairy godmother that she could go to the ball
84-1_1365.795_1.72.wav_ASR	but she had only one real
84-1_1368.295_2.94.wav_ASR	and that is that she be be be back by midnight
84-1_1371.407_11.811.wav_ASR	so she went to the ball and fell in love with the prince and was having a good time with the prince
84-1_1383.218_12.28.wav_ASR	but when the clock strike struck twelve midnight cinderella knew that she hadta get out of there
84-1_1396.098_5.08.wav_ASR	so she raced for the door and down the steps and into the carriage
84-1_1401.35_2.26.wav_ASR	but soon the carriage
84-1_1404.69_9.9.wav_ASR	and she was by herself with i think some young people who may have been rabbits and other members of the community
84-1_1415.23_19.09.wav_ASR	so she she found out that the the young lady who had disappeared disappeared at midnight
84-1_1434.84_11.51.wav_ASR	and he i guess some sort of play or something that the person was around she should please contact him
84-1_1446.76_12.16.wav_ASR	and when that didn't happen then a young man went around the village to see if by chance anybody knew anything about this young
84-1_1459.92_3.1.wav_ASR	and when she went to the house that had the two
84-1_1463.595_2.1.wav_ASR	they guess you might by now call him
84-1_1468.04_9.89.wav_ASR	girl she i think somehow got a hold of cinderella who may be washing clothes in the basement or something
84-1_1478.88_7.897.wav_ASR	and when she was brought upstairs the one shoe that had been left behind she tried on that one shoe
84-1_1486.777_13.623.wav_ASR	and it fit her so that the the young prince was going to continue to like this young lady
84-1_1501.077_2.06.wav_ASR	and so i guess they got back together
84-1_1503.537_1.94.wav_ASR	even they got married
84-1_1550.75_3.76.wav_ASR	never really had a lot of experience with clothes
84-1_1555.47_3.2.wav_ASR	pretty much always on time
84-1_1559.37_10.68.wav_ASR	and when i was growing up particularly when i was in high school there for some reason was no real time limit on what time i hadta get home
84-1_1570.61_8.74.wav_ASR	so you know i went to a lot of parties on friday night and saturday night and could come home when i wanted
84-1_1579.38_20.6.wav_ASR	and i think it was in large part because my two social workers decided that you know she he that the two of them really hadta teach me how to be able to be comfortable with myself and then to be able to know when i was out too
84-1_1600.084_3.495.wav_ASR	so i mean they were a few times when i was out too late
84-1_1604.124_2.309.wav_ASR	but nothing really ever happened to me
84-1_1606.924_3.866.wav_ASR	and then when i went to college i would come home through the summer
84-1_1611.804_6.56.wav_ASR	and i remember that i was involved with the couple young ladies
84-1_1618.528_4.623.wav_ASR	but i would go out with them but i could get home whenever i wanted to
84-1_1623.52_6.58.wav_ASR	and i remember one summer i had a job that required me to be at work at six o'clock in the morning
84-1_1630.928_3.42.wav_ASR	so sometimes during the summer i would stay at all night and then go to work
84-1_1645.61_7.485.wav_ASR	well so i worked a lot pretty well i i turned out to be
84-1_1653.47_2.186.wav_ASR	think i may have told you this
84-1_1655.73_0.463.wav_ASR	alright
84-1_1656.193_3.42.wav_ASR	but i work for a friend company for
84-1_1660.878_8.049.wav_ASR	and i when i had my stroke i started thinking about things i could do
84-1_1668.927_8.2.wav_ASR	because really between vacation and between a lot of time i spent particularly with my children
84-1_1678.067_2.92.wav_ASR	they were in a town in new jersey called prince
84-1_1681.727_2.08.wav_ASR	and they both played a lot of hockey
84-1_1684.367_2.89.wav_ASR	so i never really had a lot of time
84-1_1687.246_2.783.wav_ASR	but one thing i've decided i'm going to do
84-1_1690.506_4.76.wav_ASR	with in the past year we're gonna be moving a little further south
84-1_1695.886_3.08.wav_ASR	and i really thought that one thing i could do was bird
84-1_1699.586_2.933.wav_ASR	because i've always had an interest in that
84-1_1702.606_1.984.wav_ASR	but i've never really focused on that
84-1_1705.086_1.62.wav_ASR	and i really thought particularly
84-1_1706.856_2.9.wav_ASR	now i ride a three wheel bike
84-1_1709.936_4.506.wav_ASR	two a two wheel bike like i useta do
84-1_1714.521_16.081.wav_ASR	so i'm really hoping that we move i can learn about birds and maybe become some one of an interesting in in birdwatching because i think that would be a good thing for me to do
84-1_1736.76_2.52.wav_ASR	oh so did she live in bloomington
84-1_1760.0_20.64.wav_ASR	well i i guess when i started traveling for this friend company when i started the project when i was mainly responsible for the united states canada and mexico
84-1_1780.938_3.5.wav_ASR	but they quickly figured out that i could speak
84-1_1785.098_1.94.wav_ASR	so the ladies were in front
84-1_1787.898_2.948.wav_ASR	and i was one of the few ladies outside of friends
84-1_1791.078_1.06.wav_ASR	it was in the united states
84-1_1793.658_4.48.wav_ASR	oh they useta send me to various place
84-1_1798.398_5.96.wav_ASR	and i remember that i stayed in a real nice hotel in
84-1_1805.978_2.42.wav_ASR	and i also stayed in a nice hotel
84-1_1809.158_3.84.wav_ASR	in a nice hotel when i went to china
84-1_1813.177_5.8.wav_ASR	and i also was in a nice hotel when i was in
84-1_1822.457_6.54.wav_ASR	so i i and during one of the times i was there and it was the fourth
84-1_1829.537_3.16.wav_ASR	so i remember that the staff brought me a little cake
84-1_1833.15_7.12.wav_ASR	so i i i i i i don't really need a big old hotel all the while my wife likes something
84-1_1841.05_10.3.wav_ASR	oh i i always thought i was in places that i could be comfortable even when even
84-1_1851.626_2.28.wav_ASR	even i i do remember saying it once in awhile
84-1_1854.01_5.896.wav_ASR	he was in berlin germany for to be part of a case that was pending
84-1_1860.446_2.235.wav_ASR	and we stayed in a god off the hotel
84-1_1862.726_3.066.wav_ASR	even even that turn out to be good for me
84-1_1865.941_11.7.wav_ASR	so it was a good way for me to learn about the way different hotels can treat me different
84-1_1878.421_3.38.wav_ASR	and i i was in a hotel in a bad part of town
84-1_1882.0_1.381.wav_ASR	remember that pretty well
84-1_1897.088_7.408.wav_ASR	well when i was in college there was the park
84-1_1904.816_0.654.wav_ASR	and i told you
84-1_1905.47_0.58.wav_ASR	the problem
84-1_1906.59_6.9.wav_ASR	and over the he was there for about about thirty thirty five years
84-1_1913.91_2.92.wav_ASR	and in nineteen ninety nine he died
84-1_1917.85_5.54.wav_ASR	but before that time she and a group of people
84-1_1923.607_16.1.wav_ASR	there was one person from the class of sixty five one person from the class of eighty
84-1_1939.914_5.6.wav_ASR	the six five of us became very good friends
84-1_1945.874_9.776.wav_ASR	and every year because willie did not really have any friend
84-1_1955.75_8.1.wav_ASR	he had a child who died when when he was i think maybe six or seven years old
84-1_1964.11_8.96.wav_ASR	and and so one thing he useta do once a quarter he useta go down to new york
84-1_1973.501_5.94.wav_ASR	and we we we we we we would i went from my graduate school
84-1_1979.861_3.68.wav_ASR	and i went for every year there after for about twenty five years
84-1_1983.921_5.12.wav_ASR	well i went to a place that's no longer in existence but it's called belton
84-1_1989.678_3.6.wav_ASR	and it was a very nice
84-1_1994.718_3.712.wav_ASR	and we just had a wonderful time every year i was there
84-1_1998.43_14.51.wav_ASR	so i really think back upon that a lot and remember just how much time i had with these people and how much how much i still keep in contact with them
84-1_2012.94_5.74.wav_ASR	and so these these people are some very well known people
84-1_2019.2_6.8.wav_ASR	and so i've always had one of the wives has already died
84-1_2026.88_4.22.wav_ASR	he was the head of the thing called the
84-1_2031.651_17.0.wav_ASR	it's a big it's a big it's they work for a family
84-1_2048.851_0.828.wav_ASR	and i forgot the name
84-1_2049.811_1.4.wav_ASR	they have a huge truck
84-1_2051.568_3.28.wav_ASR	and so he's gonna arrive and move back to new york
84-1_2055.648_10.086.wav_ASR	so i'm very excited that at the end of september i'm gonna be meeting with them and and these people who go back to the class at sixty two
84-1_2066.128_2.086.wav_ASR	so i'm i'm looking forward to it
84-1_2068.397_8.98.wav_ASR	every day i i some days i kinda wish i would be a little better strength than i am now
84-1_2077.677_3.26.wav_ASR	they all know i had a stroke
84-1_2081.677_3.36.wav_ASR	and i i'm really looking forward
84-1_2085.17_5.06.wav_ASR	most days i think that maybe i should go because i'm not far enough along
84-1_2090.73_1.56.wav_ASR	but it's it
84-1_2093.19_1.8.wav_ASR	can't even remember what we were talking about
84-1_2100.86_4.44.wav_ASR	so so so we went to this very nice restaurant
84-1_2105.464_2.296.wav_ASR	we did it for about twenty or twenty five years
84-1_2108.22_5.907.wav_ASR	and it was a good place for me and for the other people that were in the group
84-1_2114.08_11.39.wav_ASR	we useta do it every year in december because it was near the time when one of our favorite people from the class and fifty two had a birthday
84-1_2132.16_4.04.wav_ASR	it was a french restaurant called
84-1_2137.66_14.62.wav_ASR	it's if you go back to the nineteen seventies and eighties and look up the restaurant it's a two fifty nine west too east
84-1_2152.28_7.02.wav_ASR	you it's in a nice old building that has three or four floors
84-1_2159.56_1.7.wav_ASR	it was exciting
84-1_2161.495_22.32.wav_ASR	and because willie would go there for three or four times through the year they knew he knew the staff really really well so that when we came in for the birthday party it was just fantastic
84-1_2184.085_1.14.wav_ASR	it was really nice
84-1_2189.53_1.988.wav_ASR	it's not there anymore yeah
84-1_2191.525_0.84.wav_ASR	it was so
84-1_2192.725_1.984.wav_ASR	there was a an hour and his wife
84-1_2195.385_3.86.wav_ASR	and i think they eventually you know was
84-1_2199.985_8.94.wav_ASR	and they saw the restaurant to a guy who was i think from either or from germany
84-1_2210.365_2.624.wav_ASR	he did not do a very good job
84-1_2212.939_7.3.wav_ASR	so it i would say after three or four years it it it it it it it it didn't interest anymore
84-1_2224.89_2.489.wav_ASR	so we're going too
84-1_2228.519_2.26.wav_ASR	so the fellow who was
84-1_2231.118_5.52.wav_ASR	which wish i could remember the name of the place that he was involved in
84-1_2237.538_4.0.wav_ASR	but he he has one son who's got three wonderful children
84-1_2242.058_2.84.wav_ASR	and they live in in north jersey
84-1_2245.216_14.64.wav_ASR	so my my friend who's now widow is has has fixed up a place i think in the fifty or sixty
84-1_2260.677_6.594.wav_ASR	so i know that's where the party's gonna be because the apartment is apparently fitting now
84-1_2267.297_1.81.wav_ASR	he's been working on it for a couple years
84-1_2290.78_3.59.wav_ASR	oh interestingly enough i had one for lunch
84-1_2296.1_4.56.wav_ASR	and i like it once in awhile
84-1_2300.734_16.34.wav_ASR	one of the people who was part of the group from lausanne is a fellow from the class of sixty five or sixty six
84-1_2317.101_4.2.wav_ASR	and he has a peanut butter and jelly sandwich every day for lunch
84-1_2321.761_2.78.wav_ASR	well what you do is you take two pieces of bread
84-1_2325.321_9.159.wav_ASR	my bread i have my bread in the freezer because i only use a certain amount of it every day
84-1_2335.061_1.789.wav_ASR	so i take the pieces of the bread out
84-1_2336.89_7.96.wav_ASR	but i i i they come to room ten
84-1_2347.07_2.92.wav_ASR	then i have a special peanut butter that i use
84-1_2350.01_1.08.wav_ASR	they've been to kootenay
84-1_2353.6_1.85.wav_ASR	well the peanut butter there is natural
84-1_2356.05_2.9.wav_ASR	so that's the peanut butter i buy
84-1_2359.35_3.68.wav_ASR	and i would we have a few chairs of that around
84-1_2363.63_3.48.wav_ASR	so i would open the jar take some peanut butter
84-1_2367.83_2.504.wav_ASR	and then i would take different kinds of jelly
84-1_2370.434_9.058.wav_ASR	but right now i'm on a kick where i have it's brownie blueberry strawberry and raspberry together in a mix
84-1_2380.014_1.86.wav_ASR	and i put that on the sandwich
84-1_2382.514_2.34.wav_ASR	then i close the sandwich
84-1_2385.454_3.553.wav_ASR	and you can either cut it in half or leave it whole
84-1_2389.007_2.9.wav_ASR	and for some stupid reason i always leave it whole
84-1_2392.387_1.62.wav_ASR	and i had a nice sandwich
84-1_2394.347_5.34.wav_ASR	so i had that about one thirty as i was preparing for my two o'clock
84-1_2413.71_5.31.wav_ASR	well wonder if something i still try to do but i think my wife probably does more of it
84-1_2420.092_4.906.wav_ASR	oh i would choose what kind of temperature i would want it
84-1_2424.998_6.36.wav_ASR	but typically i would choose cold water because most of the stuff i needta watch is cold water
84-1_2431.958_3.042.wav_ASR	so i would in the special we have a machine
84-1_2435.278_2.14.wav_ASR	we live in the in the park
84-1_2437.656_7.8.wav_ASR	we live in an area that useta be that was where we hafta buy the common
84-1_2446.076_9.42.wav_ASR	but because we're getting ready to move next year we sold our condominium and we moved into a rental unit in the same building
84-1_2455.617_4.36.wav_ASR	so we would get the water's set
84-1_2461.32_13.017.wav_ASR	we one's the water set it's it comes out on the side
84-1_2474.39_1.33.wav_ASR	so there's nothing on the top
84-1_2476.55_1.89.wav_ASR	so we hafta lose the wash
84-1_2479.39_8.06.wav_ASR	and then we put the the laundry detergent in it and start it
84-1_2487.48_6.74.wav_ASR	you can see it from the
84-1_2495.135_8.325.wav_ASR	it's not something that it's something that is easy to see from the phone
84-1_2504.52_2.52.wav_ASR	and so we put it on white
84-1_2507.302_4.58.wav_ASR	and it usually last for some reason for a hour and five minutes
84-1_2512.062_3.808.wav_ASR	but after an hour and five minutes the watch is done
84-1_2515.962_6.0.wav_ASR	if we have particular clothes that needta be put on the line
84-1_2522.162_4.18.wav_ASR	the rest of it would go into the dryer where it would dry
84-1_2526.352_8.24.wav_ASR	and then it would be ready to be folded and put in the cupboard of drawers that we use for laundry
84-1_2535.332_2.932.wav_ASR	my wife has quite a few more than i do
84-1_2538.264_8.158.wav_ASR	but it's a place where we can put our stuff and use it as we as we needta
84-1_2557.42_3.87.wav_ASR	well you hafta understand that now i have it a while
84-1_2562.42_5.82.wav_ASR	so i usually get up in the morning
84-1_2568.47_8.6.wav_ASR	and i will put on my underwear
84-1_2578.86_3.09.wav_ASR	and then i would put on my
84-1_2583.37_2.06.wav_ASR	and i would put on my socks
84-1_2586.38_6.68.wav_ASR	and then i would lie in bed for a little bit and do some exercise because exercise is very important to me
84-1_2593.52_9.62.wav_ASR	especially even though i'm neither more than three years old it's still important for me to to get some exercise and every day
84-1_2603.74_0.96.wav_ASR	so i do that
84-1_2604.776_5.64.wav_ASR	and then i will typically once that is done i'll turn on the tv
84-1_2610.876_6.2.wav_ASR	and i'll get dressed the rest of my way which includes you know my side
84-1_2617.536_4.7.wav_ASR	you haven't seen this but i wear a brace on my right foot
84-1_2622.416_1.873.wav_ASR	so i put that on as well
84-1_2624.77_4.28.wav_ASR	and i i start my day
84-2_12.09_1.1.wav_ASR	my favorite holiday
84-2_13.79_9.28.wav_ASR	it's easy thank giving because i have a very small family but usually the family comes as well as my two sons
84-2_24.03_1.468.wav_ASR	and now one of them's married
84-2_25.77_2.32.wav_ASR	and the others are gonna be married pretty soon
84-2_28.25_4.26.wav_ASR	so i look forward to a table with a few more people
84-2_32.564_2.32.wav_ASR	oh i have two sisters
84-2_35.624_2.44.wav_ASR	one of them who lives i think i told you in new york
84-2_38.244_1.46.wav_ASR	one of them who lives in chicago
84-2_40.424_2.76.wav_ASR	so they quickly come
84-2_43.573_14.028.wav_ASR	and for many many years i have until i had my stroke i was in charge of the cooking of the turkey which i do on a regular
84-2_58.053_1.58.wav_ASR	so it's really really nice
84-2_60.413_2.52.wav_ASR	now i don't do it on the globe anymore
84-2_63.47_4.5.wav_ASR	and we useta have a place at the shore but we don't have that anymore
84-2_68.71_4.28.wav_ASR	so i somebody else cook it in the evening
84-2_78.94_7.65.wav_ASR	well i've been the host for thanksgiving since my mother died in nineteen ninety
84-2_86.96_1.04.wav_ASR	so it's been awhile
84-2_92.66_0.372.wav_ASR	it is
84-2_93.22_2.6.wav_ASR	it's nice but it doesn't last for very long
84-2_100.512_2.1.wav_ASR	we celebrate firstnameh
84-2_103.112_6.44.wav_ASR	and so we we typically we don't even give permission anymore
84-2_109.668_11.36.wav_ASR	unfortunately both of the young ladies that my two sons married are both not judicious
84-2_121.788_3.708.wav_ASR	one of them i think has no relation which is fine with me
84-2_125.777_3.18.wav_ASR	and one of them i think it's basically
84-2_130.297_4.6.wav_ASR	but i think she likes cinderella as well
84-2_154.92_3.84.wav_ASR	my speech is probably the thing that i'm working on the most
84-2_159.16_7.84.wav_ASR	as you know i useta be a lawyer and i've just gone back on active duty
84-2_167.46_3.07.wav_ASR	so i can still be a lawyer if i wanna be a lawyer
84-2_171.22_15.68.wav_ASR	but i i feel that a lot of times especially with small words and pronounce and with her and left and right i'm still a little vague
84-2_187.36_3.34.wav_ASR	so that that i hafta think for awhile
84-2_190.722_2.64.wav_ASR	especially now that laura does move
84-2_193.622_1.4.wav_ASR	or it does all the driving
84-2_195.302_2.954.wav_ASR	well i hafta remember which is left and which is right
84-2_198.782_1.54.wav_ASR	that includes me sometimes
84-2_200.742_3.33.wav_ASR	and i'm i'm pretty good but back and forth
84-2_204.582_2.796.wav_ASR	and i'm hoping that i'll be able to drive at some point
84-2_207.378_8.784.wav_ASR	and not that i really want to drive because i've never been particularly interested in driving
84-2_216.44_9.7.wav_ASR	just do it because my wife sits in the other seat and my two two kids when they were around sometime they would drive but sometimes they would also sit in the back
84-2_227.22_6.2.wav_ASR	but but now since my stroke my wife does all the driving
84-2_234.05_6.33.wav_ASR	and as i say i think maybe in a year or so i may be able to start driving again
84-2_240.74_0.76.wav_ASR	oh i'm i'm not sure
84-2_247.16_2.58.wav_ASR	don't tell my wife that but yes it's true
84-2_257.54_0.74.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
84-2_263.0_2.98.wav_ASR	oh yeah i i remember my stroke pretty well
84-2_273.18_11.211.wav_ASR	well i was in the hospital for about eight days before i went to the rehab program which is also connected to time and space
84-2_285.39_20.682.wav_ASR	and that's where in my area of town which is near right now we go down instead of going up to pennsylvania which is probably around about the same
84-2_306.65_15.44.wav_ASR	and i remember you know i think i told you that on sunday morning i went out because there was a riot the night before from the guy up in minneapolis
84-2_322.53_1.5.wav_ASR	if i forget his name right now
84-2_324.03_2.88.wav_ASR	so there's a huge ride
84-2_327.03_2.723.wav_ASR	we had a building actually burned here
84-2_330.29_4.617.wav_ASR	and i went out at about six o'clock in the morning to start cleaning up
84-2_335.07_2.209.wav_ASR	and i was one of the few people out there
84-2_337.63_2.1.wav_ASR	and i remember they're being a kind of clean up
84-2_339.843_5.105.wav_ASR	and so i was there for about six to nine o'clock in the morning
84-2_345.103_1.957.wav_ASR	and then i went to get a new pair
84-2_347.387_0.994.wav_ASR	it didn't feel great
84-2_348.683_2.769.wav_ASR	so i liked liked laid down for a little bit
84-2_351.763_2.48.wav_ASR	and then i went to work in the afternoon
84-2_354.303_6.287.wav_ASR	and by the evening i was starting to feel a little worse but not terrible worst
84-2_361.05_2.15.wav_ASR	and i went to bed around ten thirty
84-2_364.003_2.577.wav_ASR	and i had my stroke in the middle of the night
84-2_367.183_3.063.wav_ASR	and in the morning my wife could not get a hold of me
84-2_370.723_2.645.wav_ASR	so we have a conference who came up and found me
84-2_373.648_1.7.wav_ASR	and they took me to the hospital
84-2_375.668_2.58.wav_ASR	that's when i spent about eight days in the hospital
84-2_378.928_4.34.wav_ASR	because because i was during covid
84-2_383.468_2.537.wav_ASR	so i really didn't see anybody there
84-2_386.828_5.56.wav_ASR	and i had it was difficult for me because i feel felt my talking was not great
84-2_392.4_3.057.wav_ASR	and i also it was just difficult for me
84-2_395.58_4.82.wav_ASR	so it was i must've watched tv
84-2_400.74_2.02.wav_ASR	and he i was in a room by myself
84-2_402.991_12.52.wav_ASR	and eventually on a monday night about a week and a couple days later i went to miami which is only about six blocks away
84-2_415.551_0.838.wav_ASR	it was pretty cool
84-2_416.971_3.157.wav_ASR	so that's when i stayed for three for two months
84-2_430.74_2.047.wav_ASR	oh i've done a lot of things to try to get better
84-2_433.0_1.662.wav_ASR	and i don't know if all of them works but
84-2_435.24_3.841.wav_ASR	so i was in the hospital for four eight weeks
84-2_439.239_9.64.wav_ASR	and every day except the weekend i had o t and p t
84-2_449.599_1.36.wav_ASR	and then i also had speech
84-2_451.039_1.499.wav_ASR	that was typical in the morning
84-2_453.139_4.394.wav_ASR	and then in the afternoon i for a while i didn't do anything
84-2_457.533_3.458.wav_ASR	but then eventually i started going to art
84-2_461.433_4.9.wav_ASR	and i i did some stuff but it wasn't really very good
84-2_467.093_6.865.wav_ASR	and i thought by the time i left there i wasn't so sure i was gonna do it
84-2_474.15_7.18.wav_ASR	so i tried it a little bit more at mackinaw which is where i go for outpa
84-2_481.83_0.958.wav_ASR	and it wasn't great
84-2_483.11_2.78.wav_ASR	soon they introduced a music program
84-2_486.65_2.184.wav_ASR	and i was always interested in singing
84-2_489.35_2.38.wav_ASR	but i don't sing a lot
84-2_491.79_3.961.wav_ASR	and i'm afraid i don't always sing on key
84-2_496.23_1.816.wav_ASR	so i thought it might be good
84-2_498.25_2.78.wav_ASR	so i took some singing lessons which i still take
84-2_501.63_4.7.wav_ASR	and then also at temple there's an aphasia program
84-2_506.586_10.4.wav_ASR	and so there's a singing program there which i think better because i get real songs instead of made up songs at major
84-2_517.118_19.5.wav_ASR	and i also i'm on on on on a to help people learn how we try to do stuff to help people learn about aphasia and see see how we can help other people who have aphasia
84-2_563.78_6.71.wav_ASR	well i have a lot of good experiences because i've had a pretty positive life
84-2_570.49_11.14.wav_ASR	and i spent up until first grade i went to school in a suburb of cleveland hills of cleveland hills of cleveland
84-2_582.166_13.72.wav_ASR	and then between between my between my first and second grade years i moved to chicago and was in a really nice suburb there called westwood
84-2_596.144_6.909.wav_ASR	and so growing up i i i was participating in a lot of different things
84-2_603.184_3.92.wav_ASR	but i was not a great athlete but i was an okay enough athlete
84-2_607.264_4.74.wav_ASR	so i usually make the last play on the team
84-2_612.29_4.45.wav_ASR	and i really liked playing hockey which we did out doors at the time
84-2_617.81_12.14.wav_ASR	so i learn a lot of experience from hockey just just about the game and about you know how to set up different play
84-2_630.86_17.583.wav_ASR	and eventually eventually eventually when i was in my what's called the banquet which is fourteen and fifteen i was made captain of the team
84-2_648.56_1.971.wav_ASR	that was a really nice dinner for me
84-2_650.531_4.636.wav_ASR	and i was and it was a good time for me
84-2_655.371_2.836.wav_ASR	my i was not on the e t
84-2_658.411_5.549.wav_ASR	but but there's enough places on the beach that i was pretty friendly with
84-2_664.191_1.68.wav_ASR	and all of them were fun
84-2_666.031_2.66.wav_ASR	so it was
84-2_668.951_1.04.wav_ASR	and she's in the air
84-2_670.145_2.671.wav_ASR	so it was really nice to meet all the people
84-2_673.365_10.54.wav_ASR	and we would have games basically from lake forest and from lake county to cook
84-2_684.865_2.36.wav_ASR	so it was just nice to get to know some people
84-2_693.81_2.2.wav_ASR	and i did get her by
84-2_696.361_5.44.wav_ASR	and i broke my collarbone
84-2_706.07_1.072.wav_ASR	it wasn't that bad
84-2_710.85_1.037.wav_ASR	it it can be
84-2_712.13_2.397.wav_ASR	but it wasn't bad for me
84-2_714.67_2.22.wav_ASR	maybe it wasn't a perfect ball
84-2_717.63_4.6.wav_ASR	but i remember i came home and i still wasn't feeling great
84-2_722.231_11.86.wav_ASR	so my dad took me to what was then called evanston hospital which is now part of northwestern medical center from down
84-2_735.0_4.82.wav_ASR	and so i remember i did some exercise and some other things
84-2_740.071_1.66.wav_ASR	and they said i had a broken collar
84-2_741.98_7.66.wav_ASR	so i i think you know i i think i actually broke my college window
84-2_751.48_1.24.wav_ASR	maybe it was only once
84-2_753.1_1.699.wav_ASR	and then i also broke my wrist
84-2_755.56_1.969.wav_ASR	but i can't remember exactly how he did that
84-2_765.892_4.149.wav_ASR	yeah you you can't have a castle on that
84-2_776.028_1.013.wav_ASR	he he
84-2_777.152_1.08.wav_ASR	you lay it over
84-2_781.243_1.08.wav_ASR	oh
84-2_785.063_2.76.wav_ASR	so did you do that in college too
84-2_797.763_0.72.wav_ASR	oh good
84-2_845.89_2.26.wav_ASR	oh yes that's the same thing we saw last
84-2_858.01_2.94.wav_ASR	so it's the story of a young man
84-2_861.0_5.48.wav_ASR	he'd say he's around twelve years old kicking a soccer ball
84-2_867.26_13.14.wav_ASR	and i guess one of the air kids went through a plate glass window and landed next to someone who was probably either reading or maybe watching tv
84-2_880.69_3.33.wav_ASR	and so he saw the ball coming at him
84-2_884.43_10.34.wav_ASR	and he noticed that a lamp had come to rest under beside him
84-2_895.09_3.248.wav_ASR	and i could see the ball coming at him
84-2_898.338_2.865.wav_ASR	so he might have caught the ball
84-2_902.03_2.001.wav_ASR	and then he wasn't sure what to do
84-2_904.138_2.02.wav_ASR	so he saw that the glass was broken
84-2_906.678_4.26.wav_ASR	so he went over to the window to see what had happened
84-2_911.418_4.592.wav_ASR	and i'm assuming that he saw the person who kicked the soccer ball
84-2_916.01_6.4.wav_ASR	but then perhaps but by then perhaps the person with the soccer ball had run away
84-2_930.177_7.24.wav_ASR	so it's the story of a young boy who was on his way to school
84-2_938.237_5.22.wav_ASR	and he wasn't sure that he needed an umbrella
84-2_943.61_7.119.wav_ASR	so he decided that he wouldn't take an umbrella because it maybe didn't look like it was gonna rain
84-2_951.25_5.94.wav_ASR	but as soon as she stepped outside and started walking a little bit the rain came down
84-2_957.89_1.84.wav_ASR	so he went back to his house
84-2_959.73_4.444.wav_ASR	and he he was all wet
84-2_964.39_3.26.wav_ASR	and his mother had a stern look on his face
84-2_967.95_1.755.wav_ASR	but there was nothing he could do
84-2_969.89_4.927.wav_ASR	so he got some new clothes and went back out into the rain
84-2_975.35_1.92.wav_ASR	but this time he had an umbrella
84-2_988.79_6.25.wav_ASR	the picture of a young lady who had a cat stuck up in a tree
84-2_995.279_8.66.wav_ASR	so she she got off her tricycle and saw i think what must have been her dad
84-2_1004.61_2.312.wav_ASR	his dad climbed up the tree
84-2_1007.139_3.56.wav_ASR	but then the ladder broke and fell to the ground
84-2_1011.04_7.14.wav_ASR	there's a a puppy who's trying to see if maybe the man or could come down
84-2_1018.34_18.709.wav_ASR	but he he was up there and needed to be rescued by the fire department who came over and was getting to get the husband get the father down and perhaps get the cat down
84-2_1188.82_0.522.wav_ASR	yeah
84-2_1190.29_11.04.wav_ASR	well so this is a story about cinderella and her two i think they were probably stepsisters and her old
84-2_1202.87_5.93.wav_ASR	so i believe that cinderella needed some help
84-2_1208.85_10.08.wav_ASR	but since she was on her own she was able to get a job with the two stepsisters and the stepmother
84-2_1219.6_12.86.wav_ASR	and she was doing a lot of stuff washing the clothes and cleaning the cleaning the cleaning the cleaning the floor and doing stuff like that and probably also doing the laundry
84-2_1233.61_13.66.wav_ASR	then it came to pass that there was a prince who lived in the castle with his father and mother and perhaps some sisters and brother
84-2_1247.87_7.51.wav_ASR	and he he was looking for somebody to fall in love with
84-2_1255.91_10.09.wav_ASR	so they everybody in the town got an invitation to this big party that they were gonna have
84-2_1266.0_7.976.wav_ASR	so the two stepsisters dressed up in fine clothes and the mother went with them
84-2_1273.976_12.38.wav_ASR	and they were the the king the king was looking for
84-2_1286.996_3.0.wav_ASR	and so she he decided to have this party
84-2_1290.119_5.02.wav_ASR	and so they were at the party
84-2_1295.299_12.78.wav_ASR	and then a fairy godmother came along and said to the young woman cinderella that cinderella should go to the party too
84-2_1308.226_9.88.wav_ASR	so she she was able to get a dress and some nice clothing including a some beautiful shoe
84-2_1319.006_8.0.wav_ASR	and they were they were involved to the wedding
84-2_1327.231_10.9.wav_ASR	and they came to the wedding in a special chair which had a ring and i think of someone who was in the back
84-2_1338.211_7.36.wav_ASR	and they came out at the party
84-2_1345.673_6.279.wav_ASR	and the the the the prince was there
84-2_1352.133_2.54.wav_ASR	and the prince saw cinderella
84-2_1355.293_3.02.wav_ASR	and they had a very good time
84-2_1358.335_10.88.wav_ASR	but the prince had the the the cinderella had been told that she needed to be home by midnight
84-2_1370.035_5.014.wav_ASR	so as the clock struck twelve she knew she hadta get out
84-2_1375.049_3.707.wav_ASR	so he left and left the prince there
84-2_1378.756_17.48.wav_ASR	and as he went out to the carriage the prince's cinderella turned back into a a servant
84-2_1396.299_11.02.wav_ASR	the and the prince prince was really upset about what had happened
84-2_1407.593_17.28.wav_ASR	so he he's his some people from his castle to go out and see if they could find
84-2_1425.678_6.62.wav_ASR	and so she went to he went to different houses and could not find anybody
84-2_1432.618_11.82.wav_ASR	when he went to the house where the two stepsisters live she was wondering to know if anybody else was there
84-2_1444.93_13.02.wav_ASR	and somehow maybe he figure out that the the young lady who was cinderella was in the other room
84-2_1458.25_1.72.wav_ASR	so he brought up cinderella
84-2_1460.57_2.92.wav_ASR	and the shoes fit
84-2_1463.42_8.56.wav_ASR	so he went back to the prince and told him about this person
84-2_1472.66_6.16.wav_ASR	and eventually the person became close again with the prince
84-2_1480.57_3.74.wav_ASR	and and in the end the prince and cinderella got married
84-2_1514.01_3.94.wav_ASR	but i don't remember what i talked about last week
84-2_1518.63_6.689.wav_ASR	so there was always a clock in my house growing up
84-2_1526.11_3.865.wav_ASR	so i i knew pretty easily what time it was
84-2_1530.23_1.698.wav_ASR	oh i think i know the story
84-2_1531.9_8.72.wav_ASR	and so i remember especially in the high school that there wasn't really any time i hadta be home
84-2_1541.12_5.3.wav_ASR	so my parents said that you know whenever you get home it's fine
84-2_1546.84_4.825.wav_ASR	you know obviously not too late but you you wanna have a good time
84-2_1551.665_5.02.wav_ASR	so especially on friday and saturday night we useta go out we
84-2_1556.735_4.043.wav_ASR	useta drink beer in one of my friends' basement and then go out
84-2_1561.105_4.17.wav_ASR	and so we would go to different parts which was a lot fun
84-2_1565.275_7.34.wav_ASR	but i always made it home except one time i actually fell asleep at the wheel
84-2_1573.075_7.54.wav_ASR	but i was driving
84-2_1580.922_5.48.wav_ASR	 somebody else name one of my friends who was named firstnamet was in the other
84-2_1587.065_3.064.wav_ASR	and he he yell at me
84-2_1590.202_0.83.wav_ASR	and i woke up
84-2_1591.802_1.28.wav_ASR	oh and it was in a stop
84-2_1593.302_0.94.wav_ASR	so nothing happened
84-2_1594.562_1.16.wav_ASR	and i was pretty lucky
84-2_1595.743_6.552.wav_ASR	so i guess it it's just good to know that a clock is always there knowing what time it is
84-2_1602.295_18.18.wav_ASR	and and hopefully you know i i i then when i was in college i used to i date a couple different girls where i was from in in
84-2_1621.213_5.323.wav_ASR	and so i had a job that started at six o'clock in the morning during the summer
84-2_1626.636_8.781.wav_ASR	so i useta stay out with my friends or at my girlfriend's house and till about four in the morning and then go to work
84-2_1635.473_3.123.wav_ASR	or i would come home and get my bike and then go to work
84-2_1638.596_3.3.wav_ASR	so it was fun but it was also pretty awesome
84-2_1661.747_12.78.wav_ASR	the only thing i can say about birds is that growing up i pretty much took birds for granted
84-2_1674.744_11.46.wav_ASR	and i remember even when i was in university and when i went to los angeles i i mean i never really thought about birds
84-2_1686.85_16.941.wav_ASR	but as i as as i started to get well i i i guess i should say that i worked a lot in when i was a lawyer
84-2_1703.791_4.937.wav_ASR	and then i went to a company where i was for a long time
84-2_1709.271_8.12.wav_ASR	but now that i'm looking for stuff to do one of the things i'm pretty interested in doing is birdwatching
84-2_1718.071_2.377.wav_ASR	so it's something i'm gonna try to do
84-2_1720.448_13.26.wav_ASR	but i i'm sure i told you but maybe i didn't that my that me and my wife are gonna move to south carolina and in the community there where i feel i can do some birdwatching
84-2_1734.128_1.611.wav_ASR	so i liked to try it
84-2_1735.948_1.252.wav_ASR	oh i hope i'm good
84-2_1737.348_1.265.wav_ASR	hope i know what i'm doing
84-2_1738.613_8.402.wav_ASR	but it's important for me to find some hobbies that i can work on and try to get feel good about it
84-2_1751.233_2.428.wav_ASR	oh oh we've already picked the place
84-2_1753.973_1.755.wav_ASR	okay okay okay
84-2_1755.813_0.848.wav_ASR	they've never been there
84-2_1757.804_3.6.wav_ASR	it's off the coast of
84-2_1763.495_4.149.wav_ASR	about forty minutes from the charlestown airport
84-2_1768.604_1.36.wav_ASR	and it's a beautiful
84-2_1772.244_3.34.wav_ASR	oh i don't wanna go today
84-2_1775.781_12.445.wav_ASR	but we we are connecting a place there that's part of a condo that's right on the beach
84-2_1788.901_5.343.wav_ASR	and so so i my wife is down there right now
84-2_1794.244_5.8.wav_ASR	so she could actually go into the building which is being constructed
84-2_1800.532_16.3.wav_ASR	and she was able to tell me that from where our company is placed my wife says that she can actually see the beach you know for the ocean
84-2_1817.192_13.006.wav_ASR	so for me that was really nice because i useta have a place in oak forest mall which my wife really liked that i didn't like so much it was
84-2_1830.198_1.1.wav_ASR	it was laid on the water
84-2_1831.912_4.94.wav_ASR	and so now i feel that i've been able to give something you know
84-2_1837.124_5.433.wav_ASR	some i've wanted to find a place that would be good for her
84-2_1843.004_3.038.wav_ASR	and i mean it's gonna be a little hot for me
84-2_1846.364_6.04.wav_ASR	but i think it's gonna be worth it because it's gonna be a great place for my wife
84-2_1861.804_4.88.wav_ASR	help help it's it's in south carolina or north carolina
84-2_1868.964_0.303.wav_ASR	alright
84-2_1877.712_1.04.wav_ASR	well it's pretty considerate
84-2_1879.112_1.64.wav_ASR	and i'm not very concerned so
84-2_1882.912_1.763.wav_ASR	it's that i think it should be good
84-2_1885.012_4.164.wav_ASR	and we know some people down there who live there
84-2_1889.212_1.86.wav_ASR	so that's gonna be really helpful too
84-2_1891.217_9.274.wav_ASR	but the the person i know really well made a fortune in in a company that he was in
84-2_1900.657_4.7.wav_ASR	so he has a lot of places now all over the world including
84-2_1929.085_7.92.wav_ASR	well probably the hotel i stayed in some nice hotel
84-2_1937.925_5.3.wav_ASR	but probably the nicest hotel i stayed in was for my wedding
84-2_1943.216_11.64.wav_ASR	and i married a lovely student when i was in college who lived in los angeles
84-2_1955.736_3.62.wav_ASR	so we got married at the four seasons hotel in georgia
84-2_1960.256_1.29.wav_ASR	and that was the real nice place
84-2_1961.546_2.702.wav_ASR	we we were able to be there for a couple days
84-2_1964.566_2.56.wav_ASR	we had a fair amount of people at our wedding
84-2_1967.137_1.529.wav_ASR	it was about two hundred
84-2_1969.686_5.86.wav_ASR	and we were able to have a wedding on a sunday afternoon
84-2_1976.586_2.56.wav_ASR	and we had a nice lunch
84-2_1979.209_12.504.wav_ASR	and then i remember that many of my friends went down to a bar further down in georgia town and with my wife and some friends and had a nice evening there
84-2_1992.089_1.731.wav_ASR	so for me it was a good place
84-2_1994.369_2.18.wav_ASR	but true i like being home
84-2_1996.549_3.359.wav_ASR	so i you know i did it
84-2_1999.989_0.545.wav_ASR	it was good
84-2_2000.709_3.348.wav_ASR	you know i like being where i am now
84-2_2196.154_4.351.wav_ASR	well i think i told you about my favorite restaurant in new york right there
84-2_2200.505_1.925.wav_ASR	one that i went to for about twenty years
84-2_2204.4_1.8.wav_ASR	oh i won't talk about that
84-2_2206.653_12.64.wav_ASR	well here in philadelphia i've got to know a few restaurants
84-2_2219.853_5.936.wav_ASR	because i lived here when i first took a job
84-2_2225.789_3.92.wav_ASR	and i was a log club for a judge and a fellow
84-2_2230.669_3.36.wav_ASR	and then i lived here for awhile before i moved to princess
84-2_2234.197_14.716.wav_ASR	but one of the places i like to eat a lot all the while it's gone up in price a little bit is a restaurant called park
84-2_2249.537_1.139.wav_ASR	and i don't know if i told you
84-2_2250.676_4.494.wav_ASR	but i useta be able to speak French pretty well
84-2_2255.756_5.814.wav_ASR	and i like going there because they have a lot of good food
84-2_2262.196_5.2.wav_ASR	most of which is again too it's got to be over prime like so many restaurant
84-2_2267.49_9.604.wav_ASR	but one thing i really liked there is my my they have a hamper that's really nice
84-2_2277.79_5.42.wav_ASR	and it's and it it can be cook different ways
84-2_2283.415_9.06.wav_ASR	and i liked my meat very very rough not cook not completely cook but cook most of the way
84-2_2293.155_8.88.wav_ASR	and it's a really nice place to get a juicy burger and either a salad or some some friend
84-2_2302.33_4.163.wav_ASR	but if if the friends drive us usually for my wife
84-2_2307.01_2.4.wav_ASR	so i usually write up getting a sale
84-2_2309.77_7.26.wav_ASR	but sometimes she makes me order the the
84-2_2336.29_0.91.wav_ASR	oh we had this too
84-2_2337.64_6.1.wav_ASR	well the peanut butter and jelly sandwich for me is pretty easy to make
84-2_2344.78_4.14.wav_ASR	my go to the most of my bread is in the freezer
84-2_2349.56_2.46.wav_ASR	so i take out two pieces of bread
84-2_2352.03_13.906.wav_ASR	one i like a particular kind of peanut butter that is made at castle which has nothing but peanuts in it
84-2_2365.936_10.164.wav_ASR	and so i usually put when i have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich which lately has been a little more frequently for some reason i don't know
84-2_2376.676_2.695.wav_ASR	and then i'll take just a little bit any jelly
84-2_2379.371_10.336.wav_ASR	but i found a jelly at that having three different types of food in it
84-2_2389.5_27.09.wav_ASR	so i put that with some with the peanut butter on a bread that is a a type of wheat bread that i find to be very good
84-2_2416.69_4.042.wav_ASR	so i i'm i'm gonna have a sandwich a little later today
84-2_2420.83_1.92.wav_ASR	and i'm probably gonna have a turkey sandwich
84-2_2423.13_2.155.wav_ASR	but yeah i like peanut butter and jelly a lot
84-2_2425.63_8.46.wav_ASR	the i've got the sandwich down to a size
84-2_2440.382_15.965.wav_ASR	well we i think i may have told you that we useta live in an apartment that we owned across the hall
84-2_2456.416_4.325.wav_ASR	but we found somebody that we thought we could sell it too
84-2_2460.976_7.3.wav_ASR	and it turned out that he the two of them bought it at a price that i think was pretty good
84-2_2468.485_11.2.wav_ASR	so while we were waiting for the place to be built in kootenay we moved it turns out across the hall where there's a rental unit
84-2_2479.5_13.0.wav_ASR	and there's a washer and a dryer with the window with all the all the
84-2_2493.08_0.68.wav_ASR	the rules
84-2_2494.18_4.5.wav_ASR	all the locations i guess you could say have a washer and a dryer
84-2_2499.03_7.61.wav_ASR	so usually they're may be a couple pieces of clothes that may go to the white clothes
84-2_2506.81_8.7.wav_ASR	but for the most part i will open the
84-2_2516.541_5.6.wav_ASR	it's a washer that works it it opens from the side
84-2_2522.721_4.203.wav_ASR	so i've put all the clothes in which are something i'm still able to do
84-2_2527.541_5.5.wav_ASR	and then i will turn on the wash
84-2_2533.721_1.86.wav_ASR	usually it's on a cold side
84-2_2535.923_4.6.wav_ASR	and once it starts moving a little bit i put in the detergent
84-2_2541.603_5.972.wav_ASR	and for some reason this this this washer takes a long time
84-2_2548.263_2.18.wav_ASR	but in about an hour it's done
84-2_2550.963_2.58.wav_ASR	and the clothes have always come up pretty clean
84-2_2553.677_3.5.wav_ASR	so i then put them in the dryer
84-2_2558.157_3.06.wav_ASR	and that's about another forty five minutes
84-2_2561.777_10.454.wav_ASR	but usually with in two hours the clothes come out and they're ready to be folded which for me take a while because i only have the one hand
84-2_2572.231_6.68.wav_ASR	so what i've tried to do is just limit the stuff that goes in my closet
84-2_2579.691_1.311.wav_ASR	and firstnamel it's at her own
84-2_2582.091_6.46.wav_ASR	yeah she she her clothes get washed with mine but i can't really put them away
84-2_2588.911_1.977.wav_ASR	and she's got a lot more clothing than i do
84-2_2605.921_5.7.wav_ASR	well i i grew up with a lot of flowers
84-2_2612.441_6.897.wav_ASR	but somehow when i married firstnamel that was not one of the things that she was really interested in
84-2_2619.338_7.26.wav_ASR	so we we have a few not a lot of fake flowers around our apartment
84-2_2627.098_3.1.wav_ASR	but i had a birthday in march
84-2_2630.778_6.74.wav_ASR	and one of the people i've become very close with is a personal friend firstnamej
84-2_2637.618_7.84.wav_ASR	and so firstnamej has been with me for i think now for about two and a half years
84-2_2645.678_7.36.wav_ASR	and she got a small plant for me that is the only living plant in this apartment
84-2_2654.178_0.9.wav_ASR	and for some reason
84-2_2655.359_3.54.wav_ASR	and i got it at the end of
84-2_2661.499_3.353.wav_ASR	and for some reason the plan is still chucking along
84-2_2664.959_0.989.wav_ASR	it's doing pretty well
84-2_2666.159_8.647.wav_ASR	so i feel good that i can keep a plan now for what is it four months
84-2_2681.403_5.463.wav_ASR	the biggestest is is that i don't hafta water it very often
84-2_2689.146_3.773.wav_ASR	but i can show it to you but i don't know what it is
84-2_2692.919_6.577.wav_ASR	maybe at the end if we have enough time see if i can see it
84-2_2699.679_5.76.wav_ASR	but it's just hard for me to see because it's on the window over there
84-2_2707.71_1.15.wav_ASR	well you're big on the plant
84-2_2725.24_2.756.wav_ASR	well find the easiest ones to start with
54-1_7.551_3.64.wav_ASR	you know

61-1_200.408_8.51.wav_ASR	and i started having all kinds of trouble
61-1_226.007_5.97.wav_ASR	well i was in rehab for four or five weeks
61-1_233.191_11.69.wav_ASR	and i finally got to the point where i could you know walk with my walker
61-1_245.707_15.99.wav_ASR	and i could speak more terms and you know help me do better

61-1_580.406_8.01.wav_ASR	and i'm gonna give you a umbrella
61-1_588.979_0.31.wav_ASR	and he says
61-1_589.931_1.01.wav_ASR	oh i don't want
61-1_592.076_3.31.wav_ASR	and so he walked and he walked
61-1_595.58_1.7.wav_ASR	and he was all dressed
61-1_598.168_0.88.wav_ASR	and he came home
61-1_599.072_1.87.wav_ASR	and he was all drenched
61-1_601.589_1.22.wav_ASR	and his mom said
61-1_603.285_1.59.wav_ASR	you should have taken the umbrella
61-1_606.37_4.87.wav_ASR	and the so he took the umbrella and carried it out in the rain
61-1_632.32_7.8.wav_ASR	well there was a cat that was up in the tree
61-1_640.874_3.84.wav_ASR	and so the guy got up there to try to help get the cat down
61-1_645.588_4.39.wav_ASR	there was a girl underneath trying to catch the cat
61-1_651.054_4.93.wav_ASR	and then they call for the firetruck
61-1_656.707_2.71.wav_ASR	and the two guys ladder ladder
61-1_659.432_3.79.wav_ASR	the dog was kinda yep
61-1_663.272_13.78.wav_ASR	and and then they would have helped him
61-1_678.744_4.75.wav_ASR	and they were gone back to the station
61-1_686.144_0.92.wav_ASR	it's that what you want
61-1_919.524_12.68.wav_ASR	slipper was needed to take care of her
61-1_932.962_5.86.wav_ASR	so these two sisters decided to take care of her
61-1_939.695_14.76.wav_ASR	but they took and used her to find make their life easier by cooking and cleaning and all that stuff
61-1_955.23_28.59.wav_ASR	and then the a representative from the to allow them to go to the magical star
61-1_984.421_9.68.wav_ASR	and the the mother said no to the cinderella and yes to the two girls
61-1_994.715_9.13.wav_ASR	and they got a quick cinderella hook them up with the stuff
61-1_1003.869_16.48.wav_ASR	and she felt like she would like to go but wasn't gonna be able
61-1_1094.545_5.59.wav_ASR	and she went ahead and went to the the thing
61-1_1100.159_2.85.wav_ASR	and and it was twelve o'clock
61-1_1103.418_2.55.wav_ASR	and she was running out
61-1_1106.476_6.11.wav_ASR	and she dropped one of her slippers
61-1_1113.602_8.23.wav_ASR	and then the pumpkin was down
61-1_1121.847_4.94.wav_ASR	and everybody was upset
61-1_1126.987_3.87.wav_ASR	well she was all
61-1_1131.671_11.07.wav_ASR	and then the guy came to try fit on the shoe
61-1_1143.689_5.91.wav_ASR	and the the the girls couldn't fit
61-1_1150.328_4.82.wav_ASR	and finally they said
61-1_1155.34_1.2.wav_ASR	hey what about her
61-1_1157.179_0.93.wav_ASR	and they put it on
61-1_1159.019_6.12.wav_ASR	and she fit perfect
61-1_1166.031_13.87.wav_ASR	and they she she went married the prince

63-2_8.939_3.81.wav_ASR	my speech is okay
63-2_12.805_5.82.wav_ASR	but a lot of times i i know what it is but i can't say it
63-2_20.929_0.67.wav_ASR	that's what it is
63-2_21.647_1.36.wav_ASR	but i know what it
63-2_23.054_4.5.wav_ASR	is and until someone tell me what it is i just can't say it
63-2_27.999_0.71.wav_ASR	and i don't know why
63-2_28.733_2.26.wav_ASR	it's the way it is now
63-2_38.859_0.35.wav_ASR	yeah
63-2_44.303_3.08.wav_ASR	well i got up in the morning
63-2_48.081_2.82.wav_ASR	and right away i i i i roll over
63-2_51.772_2.14.wav_ASR	but she she was by my side
63-2_54.63_3.83.wav_ASR	and i told her i felt a little crazy
63-2_59.076_3.32.wav_ASR	and she's seems seems miserable
63-2_62.957_13.02.wav_ASR	so then i went to the bathroom and i i i i i i went to the bathroom and did my thing
63-2_76.575_5.33.wav_ASR	and then right after i did my thing something happened in here
63-2_83.156_2.36.wav_ASR	and i said
63-2_86.28_0.56.wav_ASR	oh no
63-2_87.247_4.1.wav_ASR	and that's the last thing i remember for weeks
63-2_110.622_8.52.wav_ASR	well the last thing i knew before my stroke hit was
63-2_119.546_6.29.wav_ASR	well after my stroke hit i woke up
63-2_125.884_5.95.wav_ASR	but i remember it's this was an asthma new year
63-2_131.943_3.96.wav_ASR	so the next thing i know i'm back in wichita
63-2_137.638_4.23.wav_ASR	and i'm on the bed
63-2_141.886_3.02.wav_ASR	but my wife's there
63-2_145.895_8.26.wav_ASR	and and i slowly started talking to her
63-2_154.83_6.86.wav_ASR	but i don't think i made much since then
63-2_161.771_2.36.wav_ASR	but she was always there for me
63-2_166.318_5.94.wav_ASR	so it it you know it was okay because i i could tell her anything i want
63-2_172.567_0.74.wav_ASR	and she missed
63-2_174.287_2.43.wav_ASR	did or whatever she could
63-2_179.54_8.31.wav_ASR	and then after awhile two or three nurses would come in every day
63-2_187.899_9.62.wav_ASR	and they would do crazy things like lift my legs and lift my back
63-2_197.735_3.12.wav_ASR	and every day was something different
63-2_200.878_1.4.wav_ASR	and i would go down the hall
63-2_203.68_13.15.wav_ASR	and they would do leg lift trying to get me whatever
63-2_216.852_3.61.wav_ASR	and i i would do do stairs
63-2_220.72_2.27.wav_ASR	remember that i just there
63-2_223.735_6.54.wav_ASR	did a lot of i don't know
63-2_231.307_0.98.wav_ASR	then i don't know
63-2_232.337_1.88.wav_ASR	there's always somebody there
63-2_234.266_4.36.wav_ASR	and they were always always somebody doing something to me
63-2_238.866_2.82.wav_ASR	lots of it i don't know anymore
63-2_241.734_6.07.wav_ASR	but it it was very for the first couple weeks i it was very extra
63-2_270.707_16.25.wav_ASR	well the the the the best thing i can remember before my stroke was getting married of course

63-2_356.795_1.32.wav_ASR	a lot of things happened
63-2_358.702_5.14.wav_ASR	but there's a lot of things
63-2_363.887_3.23.wav_ASR	oh there's so much
63-2_367.253_10.28.wav_ASR	you know oh there's so many things good and bad that happened to me
63-2_377.551_2.11.wav_ASR	and i i can't do any of that
63-2_379.803_3.54.wav_ASR	it's it's a lot of what i don't even remember anymore
63-2_384.569_2.54.wav_ASR	they're either cruel or whatever
63-2_387.736_1.31.wav_ASR	that that's the way
63-2_411.303_0.58.wav_ASR	okay
63-2_413.03_4.45.wav_ASR	there there was a boy who kicked the ball
63-2_417.912_3.64.wav_ASR	and the ball went into a glass window
63-2_422.674_15.1.wav_ASR	and when it went into the window and it hit the guy on the stairs and knocked over the lamp
63-2_438.726_2.45.wav_ASR	he he grabbed the lamp
63-2_442.108_7.4.wav_ASR	and he he told him he wasn't getting it back to the lamp was fixed
63-2_481.005_0.36.wav_ASR	okay
63-2_481.732_8.03.wav_ASR	first of all the boy did not wanna take an umbrella
63-2_491.361_5.2.wav_ASR	he he he he said it was okay that she didn't have
63-2_497.241_6.7.wav_ASR	so he he he walked out in the rain and saw it was raining
63-2_504.464_2.37.wav_ASR	so she hadta go back home
63-2_508.083_4.21.wav_ASR	and he was all wet now
63-2_512.317_9.689.wav_ASR	and so she hadta get her umbrella
63-2_522.629_3.17.wav_ASR	and she put it in her hand
63-2_525.853_3.21.wav_ASR	he went to school
63-2_544.992_0.48.wav_ASR	okay
63-2_557.835_3.71.wav_ASR	well first of all i see a little girl
63-2_561.562_1.48.wav_ASR	and she's trying to get it
63-2_564.448_3.49.wav_ASR	but her her ladder
63-2_568.152_0.97.wav_ASR	so she couldn't get
63-2_569.138_10.13.wav_ASR	so she she went to her father father who couldn't get it either because the the ladder was gone
63-2_579.979_9.18.wav_ASR	and he had a dog
63-2_589.176_4.92.wav_ASR	and had a
63-2_594.116_4.12.wav_ASR	up up up the tree trying get
63-2_599.141_4.71.wav_ASR	and so because she couldn't
63-2_603.984_1.24.wav_ASR	and she couldn't get the cat
63-2_606.497_1.25.wav_ASR	couldn't get the dog
63-2_608.377_9.35.wav_ASR	he went with the firemen who got her out and got everything back to normal
63-2_1440.511_0.74.wav_ASR	okay
63-2_1441.268_16.0.wav_ASR	when the grandmother and her two grandchildren were small they brought in cinderella to clean up the house
63-2_1458.806_6.78.wav_ASR	and cinderella did all the work
63-2_1466.686_10.03.wav_ASR	as kid's got older there were more things for cinderella to do that they want
63-2_1478.756_14.77.wav_ASR	and finally they they got an invitation from the prince that there's gonna be a gala at the the prince's palace
63-2_1495.182_6.21.wav_ASR	and they they told her she couldn't go because she wasn't invited
63-2_1501.414_1.13.wav_ASR	they're always wet
63-2_1503.72_13.93.wav_ASR	so after they were gone the fairy godmother showed up and and showed them how she could do
63-2_1518.63_15.49.wav_ASR	and so the first thing the fairy godmother did was turn all the mice and everything into the carriage and the horse and the
63-2_1535.312_12.67.wav_ASR	and then cinderella was was given a fine dress to wear
63-2_1549.523_20.5.wav_ASR	and and then when she got to the ball the only thing the only thing when she got to the ball the prince could see nothing but cinderella
63-2_1571.01_3.63.wav_ASR	and they dance the night away
63-2_1575.707_4.89.wav_ASR	and then at twelve o'clock she said she hadta
63-2_1580.617_5.67.wav_ASR	so while she was going one of her slippers was left on the ground
63-2_1586.306_15.28.wav_ASR	so when she got home cinderella was back on her and her her and her shady clothes and with dogs and cats and everything
63-2_1601.634_26.69.wav_ASR	then the the shoe was sposta be broken by the the ugly mother
63-2_1629.078_3.66.wav_ASR	but they it was
63-2_1632.753_6.42.wav_ASR	and and so cinderella put on a
63-2_1639.194_4.61.wav_ASR	shoe and it was exactly match shoe the other other other
63-2_1644.445_0.98.wav_ASR	for she knew was
63-2_1646.792_3.37.wav_ASR	and so her the prince got married
63-2_1650.177_1.77.wav_ASR	and they lived happily ever after
63-2_1666.397_8.74.wav_ASR	you put on one one you put two slices of bread together
63-2_1675.69_2.37.wav_ASR	one with peanut butter one what
63-2_1678.161_2.74.wav_ASR	oh and you get them together
63-2_1680.917_3.87.wav_ASR	other and you got a peanut butter jelly sandwich
65-1_9.517_0.96.wav_ASR	seems to be easy
65-1_28.81_2.53.wav_ASR	the eighty four instance the last time i remember it's five days before
65-1_35.471_0.49.wav_ASR	five she said
65-1_36.531_2.9.wav_ASR	they happened on a thursday march the eighth of april
65-1_40.334_5.76.wav_ASR	remember we're at some friend's house having supper the previous night
65-1_46.238_15.54.wav_ASR	and i remember nothing nothing after that and till until i was moved out of i c u
65-1_63.223_3.95.wav_ASR	and the the eighteen ninety
65-1_67.496_0.83.wav_ASR	and i see the
65-1_69.041_4.34.wav_ASR	was crossing ten street in an apartment
65-1_74.421_2.67.wav_ASR	and i remember crossing in the pedestrian crosswalk
65-1_77.109_7.56.wav_ASR	tripping with the light and she and getting up close to the core panel on the car going from the edge to the edge
65-1_86.021_1.74.wav_ASR	and then i had the insurance they're sposta run around
65-1_87.783_6.82.wav_ASR	and that's the last i remember thing for as far as i remember for probably twenty twenty minutes or so
65-1_104.608_1.57.wav_ASR	years and years
65-1_107.092_0.66.wav_ASR	oh i love you
65-1_107.8_10.32.wav_ASR	it was very trouble because really trouble because didn't know where i was
65-1_119.162_6.17.wav_ASR	and there were visitors in the hospital room
65-1_125.543_3.84.wav_ASR	and these guys were saying
65-1_129.431_3.17.wav_ASR	and i knew who they were knew these these people
65-1_132.616_1.52.wav_ASR	but they're a lot of them there
65-1_134.184_1.5.wav_ASR	and i didn't know where was
65-1_136.291_2.12.wav_ASR	there were several people visiting me
65-1_138.802_1.63.wav_ASR	and and they're several months
65-1_141.127_1.76.wav_ASR	when when it's his voice he's gonna come back
65-1_143.169_1.03.wav_ASR	when's the boy's gonna come back
65-1_145.808_1.58.wav_ASR	five i thought i was perfect
65-1_148.727_11.07.wav_ASR	and but what i didn't know was that the i spent ten days with a breathing tube put down my throat and a a coma
65-1_160.403_2.47.wav_ASR	and then look like it was gonna come out every time
65-1_162.888_1.7.wav_ASR	and they gave me a triage
65-1_165.547_13.33.wav_ASR	and and so the the what turned out to be a scrawny tip and hard work chores changed my voice pretty rather where where my wife had hadta tell me
65-1_178.901_7.83.wav_ASR	but she said that you you you you had the
65-1_190.21_0.31.wav_ASR	that's it
65-1_190.701_1.11.wav_ASR	actually there was
65-1_191.914_1.46.wav_ASR	it's the one thing they liked about me
65-1_193.584_0.55.wav_ASR	and that was gone
65-1_194.184_7.67.wav_ASR	but it was important to trouble because i i like saying i didn't know where i was
65-1_202.556_3.45.wav_ASR	when i speak it's we recognize the same
65-1_206.835_1.36.wav_ASR	well it's where his wife's gonna come back
65-1_208.855_1.99.wav_ASR	and i was really really struggling
65-1_211.097_0.7.wav_ASR	really trouble
65-1_214.441_2.34.wav_ASR	that was one of the first things in my memory
65-1_227.068_4.71.wav_ASR	well it's what what in the beginning was at the
65-1_232.093_9.72.wav_ASR	and turns of my brain injury if you will certain things kinda stand out and were extremely trouble
65-1_242.008_14.18.wav_ASR	and and it just when when i happen to get forgets or or or improve i get get it if it didn't show
65-1_256.236_2.98.wav_ASR	it was extremely angry
65-1_261.478_2.001.wav_ASR	and they never didn't like you out
65-1_264.808_2.63.wav_ASR	but just really angry
65-1_267.486_1.47.wav_ASR	and i kept on turning
65-1_268.978_5.53.wav_ASR	well it was very very trouble really trouble for a while
65-1_291.425_2.81.wav_ASR	and and and i don't want you ever to repeat to that
65-1_294.408_3.91.wav_ASR	well i wouldn't wish that anybody
65-1_316.655_7.65.wav_ASR	the almost ninety nine it's almost a what
65-1_324.396_0.55.wav_ASR	again
65-1_325.376_0.84.wav_ASR	that's what it was
65-1_326.232_3.43.wav_ASR	it's just just a read now not near as severe but not near as severe
65-1_330.55_12.55.wav_ASR	but the the eighty four instance was was most interesting because because an engineer for my the company i'm employed by
65-1_343.181_6.64.wav_ASR	and i was on what they call the high point or high point level meaning i had a wonderful key to me
65-1_349.842_1.58.wav_ASR	he was gonna go more and more and more
65-1_352.182_4.66.wav_ASR	and and and my one of my supervisor's told me
65-1_356.862_0.89.wav_ASR	he was sposta do
65-1_357.802_6.2.wav_ASR	took me told me i was on the highway which meant i was going fast
65-1_364.136_1.18.wav_ASR	my cereal's laid out front of me
65-1_366.048_2.15.wav_ASR	there were no other shops in the neighborhood
65-1_369.12_8.58.wav_ASR	and then after the eighty fourth incident personally changed which i find out twenty years later's end
65-1_377.717_1.63.wav_ASR	what i find at twenty years old is in denver
65-1_380.151_3.17.wav_ASR	and the and surprised me
65-1_384.141_2.67.wav_ASR	slowly i was slow to comprehend things
65-1_387.869_5.87.wav_ASR	but finally did taking taking more time for comprehension
65-1_393.757_7.06.wav_ASR	and and and i couldn't do my engineering job to to to suit me
65-1_401.669_1.51.wav_ASR	and i didn't tell anybody that
65-1_403.668_0.89.wav_ASR	but i didn't tell anybody
65-1_404.612_0.8.wav_ASR	write it
65-1_406.295_17.87.wav_ASR	and i fake it and spent my lunch hours for months by myself in a conference learning as much as i just
65-1_424.226_1.26.wav_ASR	it's been before eight a m
65-1_426.413_1.47.wav_ASR	one nine eight four again
65-1_428.188_2.09.wav_ASR	actually before the American's with different levels of difficulty
65-1_430.428_0.54.wav_ASR	hey hey
65-1_432.046_2.46.wav_ASR	and and i was on on the exanthe avenue
65-1_434.528_1.11.wav_ASR	well i don't know common business
65-1_436.8_5.82.wav_ASR	and i just knew that that much be able to comprehend as fast as my job
65-1_443.288_1.95.wav_ASR	actually i just knew i was gonna get fired
65-1_445.562_0.85.wav_ASR	one i knew
65-1_447.165_8.14.wav_ASR	had three kids a wife and spouse were just a lovely lovely lovely lovely women there at home with the three kids
65-1_455.32_2.19.wav_ASR	and i was the king
65-1_458.431_2.45.wav_ASR	and i couldn't start thought to be fire
65-1_461.855_5.49.wav_ASR	and and so i'd say did everything i could to learn my job
65-1_467.981_7.74.wav_ASR	but it took me but they did take me probably couple three years to figure out that that i was no longer on the fast track
65-1_476.146_1.08.wav_ASR	oh no no no
65-1_477.247_2.36.wav_ASR	it wasn't obvious that it was not even the first
65-1_479.684_3.22.wav_ASR	but i it was no longer a fast track
65-1_482.928_9.4.wav_ASR	and and and the biggest most difficult part of that was the short term details
65-1_493.261_11.8.wav_ASR	and so i ended up with a franklin ladder and would write down everything in there just to help my help my short term memory
65-1_506.11_10.319.wav_ASR	so it was a fairly the aphasia and and people seeing me different at work
65-1_516.482_4.701.wav_ASR	and of course of course i look back on it a few years after
65-1_521.2_2.859.wav_ASR	and and i did not desire to be on the fast track
65-1_524.107_3.97.wav_ASR	well it it was perfectly obvious that everybody around me
65-1_528.092_0.72.wav_ASR	they were probably the same
65-1_530.176_14.41.wav_ASR	and that the writing everything down was was the biggest biggest issue to me to help help me do my job
65-1_567.07_6.54.wav_ASR	the basically it was the the
65-1_573.891_4.62.wav_ASR	three i i call it three eighty four okay
65-1_579.419_5.17.wav_ASR	that's that's how my my life has been different
65-1_585.51_11.37.wav_ASR	and i it's what i call my my favorite moment or the the the the dinner event
65-1_597.64_8.89.wav_ASR	because i've struggled with the the aphasia obviously and memory issues ever since then
65-1_606.552_13.22.wav_ASR	and and and i mean for example the the the the window of seventy six seventy seven is out of engineering school
65-1_619.826_1.84.wav_ASR	had a job in annapolis
65-1_621.855_7.67.wav_ASR	and so the it's executive by illinois i i paid rent to my folks live in their house
65-1_630.113_6.18.wav_ASR	and that winter my dad and i put the a little small car
65-1_637.015_3.44.wav_ASR	and it was quite interesting interesting project
65-1_641.315_4.08.wav_ASR	and and interesting enough i can probably
65-1_645.41_8.3.wav_ASR	the the engine had a rotor four jiffy carriage on it which had some difficulty
65-1_653.791_1.8.wav_ASR	and i could probably still do today
65-1_655.869_1.58.wav_ASR	and this is the ninety seven percent of it
65-1_658.288_2.76.wav_ASR	like probably still today you read the carpooling blog
65-1_662.6_3.89.wav_ASR	but but ask me what i had for supper last night
65-1_667.122_0.49.wav_ASR	can't tie it
65-1_669.274_0.66.wav_ASR	so yeah
65-1_670.235_1.4.wav_ASR	short short memory
65-1_671.658_13.02.wav_ASR	but but then things from from long ago
65-1_695.671_5.07.wav_ASR	well actually i was invited to a pretty magnificent dinner
65-1_701.591_4.64.wav_ASR	and and i got out of school the spring of september
65-1_706.317_1.95.wav_ASR	had a job at the company name firstnamew
65-1_709.739_0.87.wav_ASR	alright there in a second
65-1_710.687_2.65.wav_ASR	and two sisters no longer invited to the ball
65-1_714.262_5.09.wav_ASR	but i was engaged in engineering at at the ship
65-1_720.011_10.31.wav_ASR	and so so i my my customers for which we'll call it or annie's phone for a witch or fairy godmother
65-1_731.149_9.58.wav_ASR	the four one of the small four parts i hadta a cat cat
65-1_745.046_7.51.wav_ASR	and the firstnamel firstnamea firstnamee firstnamea and wife carrie were all my cooking friends
65-1_753.154_4.14.wav_ASR	so i was already doing that kind of stuff as as as a job
65-1_758.166_6.91.wav_ASR	but then my father found this this awful on an engineering project
65-1_765.797_12.68.wav_ASR	and it just happened to be that it was a problem for him as well while while i was working the the occupational interests field
65-1_778.497_8.96.wav_ASR	and and it's kinda how i graduated
65-1_815.779_2.14.wav_ASR	it was a real slipper
65-1_818.492_4.39.wav_ASR	the the hot car at the time was the the hot car at the time
65-1_823.884_3.99.wav_ASR	it was at the dance
65-1_828.597_6.2.wav_ASR	and and he useta dress those guys off
65-1_835.141_6.83.wav_ASR	and they the the the driver's the the
65-1_842.229_5.21.wav_ASR	it it was a lot of fun seeing looking in my face and and then i remember
65-1_910.099_1.2.wav_ASR	oh okay
65-1_911.875_2.36.wav_ASR	the story is there's a a young lad
65-1_914.589_8.46.wav_ASR	looks maybe maybe ten eight or seven a soccer ball
65-1_923.492_6.72.wav_ASR	and then an air kick hits the soccer ball through a house window
65-1_930.915_8.97.wav_ASR	and the soccer ball comes through the window
65-1_940.813_7.32.wav_ASR	and the dad man gets holding the soccer ball and looks through the window and says trying to figure out what's going on
65-1_951.714_0.38.wav_ASR	it done
65-1_971.063_5.65.wav_ASR	looks like a a young boy is leaving
65-1_976.736_2.88.wav_ASR	and his his mother says
65-1_979.897_1.4.wav_ASR	here's your umbrella
65-1_981.983_0.84.wav_ASR	and he says
65-1_983.049_1.03.wav_ASR	and i don't need that
65-1_984.13_4.77.wav_ASR	and then then he he leaves saying goodbye and everything
65-1_989.831_1.61.wav_ASR	the mom's holding the umbrella
65-1_991.969_3.23.wav_ASR	and the the young lad is out and about walking around
65-1_995.914_1.2.wav_ASR	and it starts to rain
65-1_997.78_1.36.wav_ASR	the search for her
65-1_999.75_0.79.wav_ASR	and he's running
65-1_1000.563_4.18.wav_ASR	and gets back to his his mom so soaking wet
65-1_1005.358_0.87.wav_ASR	and he's not happy
65-1_1006.245_1.13.wav_ASR	you know it never she happy
65-1_1008.212_2.37.wav_ASR	and then he goes outside with a umbrella
65-1_1010.631_3.09.wav_ASR	and and it looks like all of them
65-1_1027.309_5.9.wav_ASR	well the beginning it looks like a cat a cat climbed up a tree
65-1_1034.269_3.46.wav_ASR	and being probably chase by a dog come up a tree
65-1_1038.222_1.16.wav_ASR	hadta stick up in the tree
65-1_1040.013_8.761.wav_ASR	little girl who was probably her own room move over there and her tricycle and and one of her cat down
65-1_1049.333_10.48.wav_ASR	and looks like an adult figure mostly like her dad he climbed up the tree to get the cat and it's it's caught up there by this barking dog
65-1_1060.56_5.52.wav_ASR	also and now then there's also a a bird either the tree singing away
65-1_1066.533_11.02.wav_ASR	and there's also the lookin' fire department they're showing up with their ladder the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the male
65-1_1077.577_2.22.wav_ASR	that's that's that's a tree by the dog
65-1_1353.355_0.3.wav_ASR	yeah
65-1_1353.835_5.45.wav_ASR	her mother had passed away
65-1_1360.127_2.77.wav_ASR	father married
65-1_1363.72_8.84.wav_ASR	and there's the wicked stepmother that brought her too too rather mean servant servants
65-1_1373.655_13.75.wav_ASR	and and in their home life the cinderella's treated poor by the stepdaughters
65-1_1387.769_7.59.wav_ASR	and and it just worked worked very worked a lot
65-1_1395.968_9.9.wav_ASR	and then in the kingdom the king had a a army son
65-1_1406.524_19.39.wav_ASR	and one of his eyes decided to have a ball to invite the the the the prince marry
65-1_1427.134_24.41.wav_ASR	and the and so cinderella with the help of the mice to go to to wear this shoe
65-1_1451.694_17.08.wav_ASR	and and the the stepmother was intent on getting one of her her her daughters married off and and then so would not allow cinderella to go to the ball
65-1_1469.504_3.98.wav_ASR	her the stepsisters went
65-1_1474.182_11.98.wav_ASR	and and a a pumpkin and then mice went up but turned into horses
65-1_1486.874_8.89.wav_ASR	and i think the the horse from the house ended up as the the the driver of the the of the pumpkin carriage
65-1_1496.594_3.35.wav_ASR	and she she and she hadta go to the ball
65-1_1499.966_5.76.wav_ASR	also the the the prince danced the night away with cinderella
65-1_1506.4_12.64.wav_ASR	but the stepmother was she hadta be back by midnight because everything was gonna go back to the way it was at midnight
65-1_1519.217_1.04.wav_ASR	so it was
65-1_1520.273_3.71.wav_ASR	so she heard out of there and left a glass slipper behind
65-1_1524.602_11.17.wav_ASR	and and then after the the the the the the the the the prince said he's only one person interested in it
65-1_1535.789_2.93.wav_ASR	and it was the the gal that left the glass slipper behind
65-1_1538.769_9.72.wav_ASR	and and so the the invite were sent throughout the kingdom to try and figure out who was that lady left a glass slipper behind
65-1_1549.451_11.43.wav_ASR	and and it was the the lady who's who's foot fit this this small slipper
65-1_1561.723_3.47.wav_ASR	and the stepsisters never one on the slipper
65-1_1565.701_3.72.wav_ASR	and cinderella's foot would fit in the slipper
65-1_1569.443_7.35.wav_ASR	and so she was invited as the one that the the prince wanted to wanted to want
65-1_1576.915_5.67.wav_ASR	and and so then the the the cinderella's birthday
65-1_1582.609_2.0.wav_ASR	and they live happy ever after
65-1_1595.381_4.76.wav_ASR	perhaps on the week bed
65-1_1600.8_8.05.wav_ASR	you would use the knife and and spread the spread the peanut butter on one side of the bread
65-1_1609.79_6.11.wav_ASR	but then on the other other other other other bread the optimal jelly is great
65-1_1617.339_1.5.wav_ASR	and then she take a spoon
65-1_1619.081_5.76.wav_ASR	the not knife because he he get up the the the the jelly and the the the jar
65-1_1624.893_6.9.wav_ASR	but you take your spoon and and spoon out the the the the grape jelly on the other piece of bread
65-1_1632.163_2.41.wav_ASR	use the knife to spread it out
65-1_1634.597_2.32.wav_ASR	then then put the two halves together
65-1_1636.935_3.5.wav_ASR	and you got the alphabet the alphabet peanut butter and jelly sandwich
65-2_8.167_1.85.wav_ASR	speaks fast
65-2_10.563_0.77.wav_ASR	much improve
65-2_12.338_9.08.wav_ASR	the the whole thing is of speech and speech specifically for words across different words each less than it did
65-2_22.185_23.08.wav_ASR	the what what happens is that the if i have an account to tell a story or something like that i will may do it and and then think later
65-2_45.514_1.3.wav_ASR	and i should've said that
65-2_46.935_0.67.wav_ASR	they could've said that
65-2_48.111_1.09.wav_ASR	why why didn't i say
65-2_49.95_6.53.wav_ASR	of course in the trouble shooting a lot of locations if there's some difficult with a car
65-2_57.16_5.08.wav_ASR	it helps amazingly if i think about it for about a day or so
65-2_62.323_26.47.wav_ASR	and i'd seen it before the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the
65-2_89.557_8.62.wav_ASR	and oh oh and i'll after i get a headache
65-2_98.79_1.57.wav_ASR	why why didn't i think that before
65-2_100.765_5.64.wav_ASR	if before before my eighty four fact i would've thought of that event
65-2_107.061_5.26.wav_ASR	but it's much more difficult and and takes a longer than it did
65-2_112.37_1.84.wav_ASR	and that's it
65-2_114.233_1.4.wav_ASR	been that way for thirty six years
65-2_127.18_6.21.wav_ASR	the first one was a where i was tai chi at an intersection
65-2_134.294_2.7.wav_ASR	and and ended up being
65-2_137.011_6.39.wav_ASR	and i i caught the a old international airforce school in the driver's side
65-2_144.01_12.54.wav_ASR	and had a ladder broken ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder
65-2_157.19_1.61.wav_ASR	did i say pumpkin lunch
65-2_159.526_1.7.wav_ASR	seventy years old
65-2_161.937_1.51.wav_ASR	the three of us in the car
65-2_164.72_6.62.wav_ASR	and and i in a coma for three or four weeks
65-2_172.132_7.28.wav_ASR	hospital probably probably about two and a half months
65-2_180.19_6.53.wav_ASR	and their third child was born three days after i was moved out of siu
65-2_190.003_8.12.wav_ASR	and the second one was february nineteen ninety nine
65-2_199.113_2.48.wav_ASR	it was a shower on the left side
65-2_202.563_6.32.wav_ASR	and and i believe that i was unconscious for
65-2_209.678_1.66.wav_ASR	well i i guess i don't know how long
65-2_212.237_10.04.wav_ASR	but i recall walking across the street starting across and seeing the fourth panel of the car in front of me
65-2_223.056_2.51.wav_ASR	and then i had the the sensation of being sposta be around
65-2_226.386_7.17.wav_ASR	and then later like say i i first i remember things maybe
65-2_234.386_0.46.wav_ASR	five i don't know
65-2_234.865_0.96.wav_ASR	twenty minutes later
65-2_236.459_2.59.wav_ASR	and and i i was in a great many
65-2_239.878_5.52.wav_ASR	and i was in a wonderful mood because the eighty four index of the last time i remember it's five days before the accident
65-2_246.349_7.14.wav_ASR	and and this one i was afraid that i was what i was doing and what happened
65-2_254.174_2.51.wav_ASR	and i was in a really great
65-2_257.551_13.19.wav_ASR	and then i say a a brain injury because think it was about one day or two days later
65-2_271.809_19.88.wav_ASR	and that was the most except for exercise pain in the leg from that the not knowing if the little bit would ever go away was a much concern if you
65-2_292.55_3.94.wav_ASR	it did finally go away when the brain swelled went down
65-2_296.863_0.66.wav_ASR	finally we were
65-2_297.627_3.16.wav_ASR	and i recall maybe three four or five
65-2_303.117_1.68.wav_ASR	well last night i spent a lot of time
65-2_305.602_7.65.wav_ASR	and and and the doctors could not tell me whether that the the difficulty would ever go away
65-2_313.306_5.33.wav_ASR	it was absolutely pain
65-2_318.652_8.33.wav_ASR	and i recall that the o t guy that stuck a pen in my hand and said
65-2_327.006_12.71.wav_ASR	oh oh after three or four months when the all the the fires and the tabi's in the tabi's hospital started to heal he said
65-2_340.67_4.18.wav_ASR	oh you know that's probably the most painful injury you know pain pain pain
65-2_345.576_0.85.wav_ASR	oh okay
65-2_346.527_1.96.wav_ASR	yeah well it's just me being a big baby then right
65-2_349.558_1.88.wav_ASR	but he he he he he jack
65-2_353.552_2.83.wav_ASR	that's kind of it
65-2_356.478_4.01.wav_ASR	that those are the two sections in it at at at a top level
65-2_372.985_7.65.wav_ASR	oh west ten going into my apartment
65-2_399.4_12.1.wav_ASR	the after the first eighty four incident when i did not know
65-2_411.553_17.22.wav_ASR	what happened was at the eighty four laptop were first adopted if you will by by the company
65-2_429.508_17.32.wav_ASR	and and my my boss at that time sent me to
65-2_447.04_0.75.wav_ASR	okay
65-2_449.397_1.27.wav_ASR	what say we're we're play with
65-2_450.939_2.51.wav_ASR	but learn how to use their their at home
65-2_454.232_6.24.wav_ASR	and of course this is before the week eight four and and there's kind of things
65-2_460.758_11.03.wav_ASR	and i i've been doing nassau which is north of Nassau for the company for quite a long time
65-2_472.499_9.05.wav_ASR	but but that was all on a a desk and that kind of stuff or or a desk or a desk or a desk or a desk or a desk or a desk or a desk or a desk or a desk or a desk or a desk or a desk or a desk or a desk or a desk or a desk or a desk or a desk or a desk or a desk or a desk or a desk or a desk or a desk or a desk or a desk or a desk or a desk or a desk or a desk or a desk or a desk or a desk or a desk or a desk or a desk or a desk or a desk or a desk or a desk or a desk or a desk or a desk or a desk or a desk or a desk or a desk or a desk or a desk
65-2_482.344_4.62.wav_ASR	and and so here's just a simple little laptop
65-2_486.979_1.14.wav_ASR	how to be nice
65-2_488.329_4.44.wav_ASR	and and so they brought this my boss brought this laptop down
65-2_492.784_4.6.wav_ASR	and and the other years there was a a unusual man that came along with me
65-2_498.448_4.81.wav_ASR	and it tried to use a computer computer use a manual
65-2_503.994_7.47.wav_ASR	if you're ready a major phone number of any kind they are extremely difficult
65-2_512.342_14.661.wav_ASR	and one of the one one thing in particular which was problem when the in the and the man man was so happy when he said to select something
65-2_528.184_0.51.wav_ASR	slip it
65-2_528.839_12.43.wav_ASR	well have we never had any training in in a a a lot or mechanic shop what what did it sleep me
65-2_542.262_6.07.wav_ASR	and and after several days of trying to figure out what sleep meant
65-2_548.888_1.04.wav_ASR	there's a lot of
65-2_550.399_0.6.wav_ASR	slip me
65-2_551.438_0.49.wav_ASR	aphasia
65-2_552.509_5.58.wav_ASR	what what they meant by select i couldn't figure it
65-2_558.551_0.56.wav_ASR	it could
65-2_559.312_1.04.wav_ASR	there's no way
65-2_560.944_2.31.wav_ASR	extra trouble really trouble by
65-2_564.422_5.97.wav_ASR	and so so finally i called a coworker and says
65-2_570.608_3.88.wav_ASR	what what did they say select me when they say select
65-2_575.568_7.44.wav_ASR	and it surprised the cat up in the tree and moving the cat all the way
65-2_583.899_1.23.wav_ASR	that's what they meant by sleep
65-2_585.777_2.95.wav_ASR	well hell that was never described in the manual at all
65-2_589.857_3.86.wav_ASR	and that that really that through me for a little
65-2_594.838_7.3.wav_ASR	and so i i became became very questioning as to whether whether i could go back to work and even function at work
65-2_603.43_5.21.wav_ASR	and and so so finally the the they'd say the the tip from the cookie
65-2_609.025_0.57.wav_ASR	oh okay
65-2_609.645_8.98.wav_ASR	but it was much bigger of terms which the the dog's man
65-2_619.047_2.1.wav_ASR	but i know there's this dog
65-2_621.166_1.3.wav_ASR	it was before march so it existed
65-2_623.365_14.01.wav_ASR	as a dog's mind it did not comprehend the somebody would would have the the the ball and imagine if they'd have the the golf and stuff
65-2_638.605_1.01.wav_ASR	they did not
65-2_640.35_2.3.wav_ASR	the dog's name didn't decide that anyway
65-2_643.738_14.19.wav_ASR	and so so the and so i went back to work and struggling with the aphasia and and trying to to to to function
65-2_658.457_15.64.wav_ASR	and and finally my i after a couple years the company brought out to what they call the franklin plan and and said
65-2_675.07_5.2.wav_ASR	you might might have it take the take the franklin park and then write stuff down
65-2_681.229_2.47.wav_ASR	and so well that was the guy said
65-2_684.72_2.15.wav_ASR	mean just being able to the right right thing down
65-2_686.892_1.67.wav_ASR	so i i carry a small
65-2_689.233_0.96.wav_ASR	how would he write it right now
65-2_690.968_8.11.wav_ASR	still i carry a small notebook notebook notebook where i go to day
65-2_699.671_10.58.wav_ASR	because that was writing what i figured out at when when my my boss told me how to write stuff down with a franklin plan
65-2_710.85_7.47.wav_ASR	hold on the map that that was a new new new lease on life if you will
65-2_719.266_2.66.wav_ASR	but that they're pretty there
65-2_721.95_17.32.wav_ASR	and also i ended up as a accountant as a accountant for the company in the department of people and the financials keeping all kind of stuff
65-2_739.905_10.88.wav_ASR	twelve i'd meet somebody new i will always say they're name over and over again since i meet somebody new
65-2_751.358_5.4.wav_ASR	use their name and any kind of vehicle with them
65-2_757.276_2.99.wav_ASR	useta be your name every time first of all name or or both
65-2_760.315_4.68.wav_ASR	and and then after after the conversation write their name down
65-2_766.354_8.45.wav_ASR	and and and that's that's a a mile's drive that i that i still use today
65-2_775.921_2.94.wav_ASR	for example i met in our neighborhood maybe
65-2_779.492_1.18.wav_ASR	and i mean i'm at home now
65-2_781.203_0.98.wav_ASR	knocked down the fire
65-2_782.926_11.55.wav_ASR	met a fellow in the neighborhood and he moved to the neighbor's some some time ago and and he moved to the neighbor's some time back
65-2_794.526_1.25.wav_ASR	and i got my name
65-2_795.797_6.87.wav_ASR	and tell his name over and said his name over and then read it down
65-2_803.378_7.6.wav_ASR	and this morning i saw him out for a walk and and couldn't call his name at first but then i thought for awhile
65-2_810.996_1.51.wav_ASR	and then finally finally the name came through
65-2_813.742_14.39.wav_ASR	so but the the difficulty on on reading names is quite quite quite a little too and help help me learn to pronounce it
65-2_839.375_0.52.wav_ASR	yes
65-2_840.697_4.78.wav_ASR	the i think i mentioned to you last week
65-2_846.085_1.32.wav_ASR	maybe maybe
65-2_847.746_4.92.wav_ASR	time i spent a lot of time at the rehab hospital in denver as a volunteer
65-2_853.54_6.13.wav_ASR	and because i i start the phone four which is twenty years ahead of the eighty four
65-2_860.446_8.79.wav_ASR	and it became rather trouble for me because having they just didn't do therapy for the brain and those years
65-2_869.993_1.69.wav_ASR	so there's no therapy
65-2_871.699_1.97.wav_ASR	you're able to drive
65-2_873.684_3.67.wav_ASR	but if you're able to just drive a little bit go
65-2_878.184_5.53.wav_ASR	and because they just did not do therapy in those years
65-2_883.737_16.3.wav_ASR	and and over the course the next twenty years wife and i found out about from people that had therapy brain injuries later on
65-2_901.056_3.61.wav_ASR	and the shoe is four to five times more expensive
65-2_905.719_4.72.wav_ASR	it's what they're telling people even fifteen years ago
65-2_911.291_15.93.wav_ASR	and so i wanted to share that with with patients at arizona just to give them hope that that recovery is is possible
65-2_928.404_1.38.wav_ASR	it years take a long time
65-2_930.61_10.94.wav_ASR	and in oh four when i started there at arizona it was i heard nurses telling patients and their families
65-2_942.297_1.58.wav_ASR	one a year and a half
65-2_944.156_1.01.wav_ASR	year and a half
65-2_945.302_0.94.wav_ASR	years and years and years
65-2_947.407_3.51.wav_ASR	hey you don't stop recovering
65-2_950.937_7.04.wav_ASR	the rat maybe aspirin if you will and slow down pretty rapidly after a a year or a half
65-2_958.775_1.9.wav_ASR	you never never stop recovering
65-2_961.454_7.72.wav_ASR	in the eight eighty four instance i had a a dead spot with no feeling above the left head
65-2_970.136_2.65.wav_ASR	and there's just something that accepted
65-2_972.842_1.73.wav_ASR	and there was a pumpkin out there
65-2_974.655_0.98.wav_ASR	you know no big deal
65-2_975.956_3.16.wav_ASR	but to stick a pen in there then wouldn't wouldn't feel
65-2_979.96_1.4.wav_ASR	oh no big deal
65-2_981.865_4.86.wav_ASR	and then it was probably be five years ago or something
65-2_987.413_0.4.wav_ASR	thank you
65-2_987.879_0.74.wav_ASR	alright
65-2_989.309_5.7.wav_ASR	twenty five years after the eighty four event i was in the beginning putting on my sock sock ones one morning
65-2_996.424_4.47.wav_ASR	and i had feeling in the spot that had no feeling for twenty five years
65-2_1002.063_12.36.wav_ASR	so what i'm doing actually is that the recovery may slow down slightly but still slowly
65-2_1014.632_2.9.wav_ASR	but still get never stop recovering
65-2_1017.689_1.16.wav_ASR	he just doesn't stop for a couple hours
65-2_1019.52_6.059.wav_ASR	oh i'm i'm under pressure
65-2_1068.805_3.42.wav_ASR	yes yeah it's not right
65-2_1072.242_7.48.wav_ASR	just tell time time time is the time you're alive and and this kind of case
65-2_1080.467_7.98.wav_ASR	because you you the feeling that you don't have it will less and important
65-2_1088.535_2.52.wav_ASR	and and you'll notice one day you
65-2_1091.749_2.26.wav_ASR	crack i i have feeling there i didn't have before
65-2_1094.551_1.56.wav_ASR	actually it will happen
65-2_1096.384_0.98.wav_ASR	you will experience that

65-2_1290.557_3.4.wav_ASR	and i i ran her that that dance
65-2_1294.796_2.28.wav_ASR	and that's where we started dating
65-2_1297.1_3.94.wav_ASR	and and oh it's quite a few years or so
65-2_1301.09_1.27.wav_ASR	they hadta run back about three years or so
65-2_1303.312_4.59.wav_ASR	and after about four years i figured out that well maybe something's going on
65-2_1307.917_1.44.wav_ASR	and i'll get more serious about this
65-2_1310.334_6.28.wav_ASR	so it was just i i i choose her of of picking me up at at a school dance
65-2_1317.648_2.02.wav_ASR	that's where where she picked me up in the day
65-2_1359.514_5.59.wav_ASR	one a young boy's having a soccer ball
65-2_1365.124_0.54.wav_ASR	he's kicking it
65-2_1366.388_2.61.wav_ASR	he he that stands up going through the house window
65-2_1369.723_9.4.wav_ASR	one a gentleman on a couch here sitting right by the soccer ball comes through and sees right by where the soccer ball comes through and decides his
65-2_1379.989_6.19.wav_ASR	and then he he he gets the ball's he he stands by the window trying to find out just what went on
65-2_1402.182_12.63.wav_ASR	and the beginning this this mother it appears has had an umbrella and wanted to give it to her son before he goes off to school or goes somewhere
65-2_1415.551_2.24.wav_ASR	and he he says
65-2_1418.288_0.93.wav_ASR	he says no and just
65-2_1419.62_0.77.wav_ASR	oh no mom i needta eat
65-2_1421.306_1.08.wav_ASR	and then jelly
65-2_1422.451_2.41.wav_ASR	and then in the middle and start raining on him
65-2_1425.438_1.43.wav_ASR	and then rain heavier on him
65-2_1426.933_7.19.wav_ASR	and then and then he goes back home just to soak it through
65-2_1434.453_6.25.wav_ASR	and then the last the end of the story was he learned his lesson and has the umbrella with him as he's walking in the rain
65-2_1455.01_13.73.wav_ASR	the way this started was that it looks like there's a a tree with a dog at the base of the tree
65-2_1469.12_2.18.wav_ASR	the dog's barking at this guy
65-2_1471.974_7.79.wav_ASR	and on the tree limb there's a cat
65-2_1480.206_6.04.wav_ASR	and it would appear that a cat climbed up the tree
65-2_1487.152_3.15.wav_ASR	the little girl's cat climbed up the tree and got stuck up there
65-2_1491.016_10.21.wav_ASR	they they by mail a man was either been chased up the tree by the dog or climb the tree to help the little guy's cat
65-2_1501.878_3.4.wav_ASR	it's also a firetruck and a fire engine
65-2_1506.838_1.32.wav_ASR	her firemen are carrying a ladder
65-2_1508.684_7.57.wav_ASR	and looks like the the ladder is being used by the firemen to the rescue either the the man or the cat or both
65-2_1517.004_11.24.wav_ASR	and and the a small bird just singing away just enjoying the the the old old stuff
65-2_1528.296_3.07.wav_ASR	okay
65-2_1754.983_9.4.wav_ASR	and cinderella was a the daughter of a king who's
65-2_1764.522_2.45.wav_ASR	her mother had passed away
65-2_1767.818_1.36.wav_ASR	her father remarried
65-2_1769.925_8.29.wav_ASR	and the stepmother had two two daughters who were mean mean daughters
65-2_1778.914_21.3.wav_ASR	and as they after they were married the the father and mother and stepmother married cinderella to work around the place where around the house where the stepdaughters were were did did basically nothing
65-2_1801.139_8.38.wav_ASR	and so so cinderella spent her time working cleaning cleaning the kind of stuff
65-2_1810.138_10.22.wav_ASR	and and in that in the kingdom there was a a prince who was not married
65-2_1821.196_18.68.wav_ASR	and exercise to the king especially his his son to the evil young ladies in the kingdom
65-2_1840.902_3.19.wav_ASR	so the word is put out but the ball coming back
65-2_1844.858_6.3.wav_ASR	and cinderella was really happy about the ball coming coming up as they're the the stepsisters
65-2_1851.712_16.43.wav_ASR	and so the the farms birds mice mice make a beautiful dress for cinderella for the ball
65-2_1868.918_10.26.wav_ASR	and and then at the last minute the stepmother told cinderella she was not going to the ball
65-2_1879.2_8.54.wav_ASR	and and also the stepdaughters were really really mean to her
65-2_1888.574_2.81.wav_ASR	and so so the stepdaughters went to the ball
65-2_1892.097_14.38.wav_ASR	and but in the meantime well before before the ball a cinderella's fairy godmother showed up and and said that well
65-2_1906.5_5.6.wav_ASR	and so it it made for her a just a lovely gown
65-2_1912.863_16.73.wav_ASR	and turn a pumpkin into a coach pulled by by mine i believe that were turning in the horses
65-2_1930.594_4.29.wav_ASR	and so and she ended up going to the ball
65-2_1935.637_15.69.wav_ASR	and the prince was invited with the stepdaughters and and everyone around there and then and only hit it off with cinderella
65-2_1951.795_2.29.wav_ASR	instead spending the night dancing with cinderella
65-2_1954.409_7.13.wav_ASR	the her godmother told cinderella that that he hafta be home home by midnight
65-2_1962.363_5.08.wav_ASR	and so the the the the prince and cinderella were dancing at midnight
65-2_1967.926_1.87.wav_ASR	and then cinderella
65-2_1970.219_0.31.wav_ASR	oh no
65-2_1970.547_6.69.wav_ASR	and i runs runs out of the place leaving a glass slipper one glass slipper behind
65-2_1978.161_9.82.wav_ASR	and as she's being driven the the coach turned back into a pumpkin
65-2_1988.0_2.49.wav_ASR	and the the horse's turned back into the mice
65-2_1990.617_5.26.wav_ASR	and the the footmen are back in the horse and or or dog
65-2_1996.13_0.56.wav_ASR	alright
65-2_1997.231_3.15.wav_ASR	and then so but still that it was over
65-2_2000.401_10.91.wav_ASR	and and then after the ball the the prince decided that there was only only this cinderella they were interested in
65-2_2012.653_3.04.wav_ASR	 nobody knew nobody knew cinderella was and could not find her
65-2_2016.419_10.69.wav_ASR	and so he he he put his eyes out to the task of trying to lay cinderella with the glass slipper that that she left behind
65-2_2027.888_3.08.wav_ASR	and came to cinderella's house
65-2_2031.017_3.76.wav_ASR	the they slipper did not fit the the stepsisters
65-2_2035.46_4.69.wav_ASR	and then but turn out it did fit fit fit fit cinderella
65-2_2041.079_9.609.wav_ASR	and so so it ended being that that cinderella and the prince got together and married live happily ever after
65-2_2063.239_2.41.wav_ASR	we have two slices of bread
65-2_2066.402_6.391.wav_ASR	he had the greats of peanut butter and jelly and have a knife or or a spoon

tcu07a_320.674_0.42.wav_ASR	yeah
tcu07a_322.153_0.55.wav_ASR	yeah
tcu07a_358.045_6.12.wav_ASR	and they didn't fit them but you know
tcu07a_365.261_1.33.wav_ASR	yeah the being
tcu07a_367.6_2.3.wav_ASR	but it's hard to think of the
tcu07a_370.3_3.58.wav_ASR	five i don't know
tcu07a_374.981_1.26.wav_ASR	yeah probably
tcu07a_378.643_0.4.wav_ASR	now

tcu07a_571.77_0.61.wav_ASR	firstnameg firstnameg
tcu07a_574.061_11.43.wav_ASR	the was get gave and find out what was going on
tcu07a_585.595_0.57.wav_ASR	oh
tcu07a_591.788_0.35.wav_ASR	mkay
tcu07a_601.0_0.36.wav_ASR	okay
tcu07a_602.696_0.46.wav_ASR	okay
tcu07a_603.992_8.79.wav_ASR	there was a mother and her
tcu07a_615.423_20.75.wav_ASR	and he was giving her to take the gown
tcu07a_637.149_2.45.wav_ASR	and so
tcu07a_642.247_0.35.wav_ASR	and she said
tcu07a_642.854_1.48.wav_ASR	well i don't need it
tcu07a_645.573_10.02.wav_ASR	and so he started to go go
tcu07a_656.225_7.02.wav_ASR	and he struggled and realized that he needed it
tcu07a_663.668_10.2.wav_ASR	so he got the things from mom
tcu07a_674.299_13.15.wav_ASR	and and and he got a thing
tcu07a_705.629_0.55.wav_ASR	okay
tcu07a_706.919_0.66.wav_ASR	and there
tcu07a_709.213_4.84.wav_ASR	he is kicking kicking
tcu07a_714.105_3.62.wav_ASR	maybe he's walking walking
tcu07a_718.686_2.0.wav_ASR	and he is
tcu07a_722.226_6.54.wav_ASR	he was had his thing up
tcu07a_729.621_0.69.wav_ASR	and he fell
tcu07a_730.508_2.92.wav_ASR	or he's his thing
tcu07a_734.264_6.18.wav_ASR	and so no he's just upset here in the by himself
tcu07a_741.603_4.92.wav_ASR	and so he somebody called
tcu07a_747.232_5.05.wav_ASR	and so now he's he's man is coming up
tcu07a_752.706_2.87.wav_ASR	and they're gonna get the
tcu07a_756.359_2.18.wav_ASR	oh we did the thing up
tcu07a_759.12_5.13.wav_ASR	so he can take it down and make it down
tcu07a_766.256_4.05.wav_ASR	but the reading even maybe maybe he was on here the
tcu07a_771.091_5.47.wav_ASR	because gone and gone was having to help her
tcu07a_777.474_8.41.wav_ASR	with the dog and man man man
tcu07a_786.29_0.77.wav_ASR	can't think of her
tcu07a_788.525_7.26.wav_ASR	and and that's how way in the anyway
tcu07a_796.339_5.59.wav_ASR	but ended up he did been seen to be the one that was in
tcu07a_803.428_0.37.wav_ASR	okay
tcu07a_810.884_0.43.wav_ASR	yeah
tcu07a_817.503_0.34.wav_ASR	yeah
tcu07a_822.929_1.62.wav_ASR	come yourself of the detail
tcu07a_824.817_0.32.wav_ASR	alright
tcu07a_829.258_0.31.wav_ASR	okay
tcu07a_832.777_0.33.wav_ASR	okay
tcu07a_923.902_0.54.wav_ASR	mkay
tcu07a_932.792_1.57.wav_ASR	okay
tcu07a_936.625_3.32.wav_ASR	he was a
tcu07a_943.222_1.11.wav_ASR	and he
tcu07a_947.118_4.63.wav_ASR	see she was a
tcu07a_955.779_0.59.wav_ASR	oh man
tcu07a_956.619_4.65.wav_ASR	he was
tcu07a_969.306_4.23.wav_ASR	and and anyway her her
tcu07a_974.209_3.69.wav_ASR	he did to be
tcu07a_978.898_11.55.wav_ASR	they were all three gonna go to the
tcu07a_991.517_2.85.wav_ASR	it was
tcu07a_995.165_3.1.wav_ASR	and they wouldn't let her
tcu07a_999.781_0.87.wav_ASR	so they went
tcu07a_1001.665_2.88.wav_ASR	and it's and see her name
tcu07a_1004.567_11.65.wav_ASR	and her this lady her mother
tcu07a_1016.234_0.87.wav_ASR	yeah mail
tcu07a_1017.905_4.8.wav_ASR	and so she didn't think on them
tcu07a_1023.107_4.01.wav_ASR	and and so he he he ran
tcu07a_1028.26_2.54.wav_ASR	and she could do it for so long
tcu07a_1031.136_3.36.wav_ASR	and then and then he he hadta get him home
tcu07a_1034.922_4.78.wav_ASR	because he would be to to go back in to the
tcu07a_1040.481_1.68.wav_ASR	he would change change
tcu07a_1043.239_4.609.wav_ASR	so after that he left
tcu07a_1051.113_2.61.wav_ASR	he knocked her thing behind
tcu07a_1054.499_2.85.wav_ASR	so he's he tried the umbrella
tcu07a_1058.294_7.77.wav_ASR	and they hadta take everybody
tcu07a_1066.532_4.0.wav_ASR	and he finally finally found her
tcu07a_1070.549_1.74.wav_ASR	and she was one
tcu07a_1072.994_5.63.wav_ASR	and they were in in february
tcu07a_1078.898_1.38.wav_ASR	okay okay
tcu07a_1090.586_7.4.wav_ASR	and i would get a get get the
tcu07a_1102.225_1.53.wav_ASR	oh why are you
tcu07a_1104.859_11.83.wav_ASR	we would get the two two things of of of bread bread bread
tcu07a_1117.546_9.53.wav_ASR	and then i would get some some
tcu07a_1130.64_2.36.wav_ASR	and i would do it on there
tcu07a_1134.996_0.58.wav_ASR	yeah
tcu07a_1136.123_0.74.wav_ASR	and i said
tcu07a_1137.342_7.1.wav_ASR	the they
tcu07a_1145.996_1.79.wav_ASR	they would be there
tcu07a_1147.803_1.91.wav_ASR	they would do that
tcu07a_1150.186_8.47.wav_ASR	and then they would do their there
tcu07a_1159.412_1.07.wav_ASR	and do it up
tcu07a_1168.402_0.79.wav_ASR	and
tcu07a_1172.527_1.39.wav_ASR	can't do it
tcu07a_1174.758_0.36.wav_ASR	yeah
thompson04a_40.212_0.56.wav_ASR	oh
thompson04a_43.668_1.11.wav_ASR	five i don't know
thompson04a_45.764_3.51.wav_ASR	but you know everybody says that they do something and i don't know it
thompson04a_51.423_0.91.wav_ASR	that's what i do
thompson04a_53.786_1.27.wav_ASR	so i don't know what i'm doing
thompson04a_64.191_1.081.wav_ASR	oh it's been fine
thompson04a_73.662_0.78.wav_ASR	oh yes
thompson04a_80.864_0.78.wav_ASR	and i knew it
thompson04a_81.889_0.96.wav_ASR	firemen
thompson04a_84.823_0.87.wav_ASR	but i knew it right
thompson04a_87.072_2.73.wav_ASR	but i all so i this one right here
thompson04a_90.84_1.31.wav_ASR	every said right here
thompson04a_93.927_2.34.wav_ASR	and nobody knew what i was doing
thompson04a_97.88_1.65.wav_ASR	and that it was hard they didn't know
thompson04a_99.827_1.35.wav_ASR	oh i go right every other
thompson04a_102.061_0.98.wav_ASR	they were everybody
thompson04a_106.522_3.82.wav_ASR	and i didn't like that
thompson04a_112.768_1.75.wav_ASR	but it's part of the
thompson04a_122.553_1.05.wav_ASR	it's a ladder
thompson04a_123.622_0.75.wav_ASR	good like
thompson04a_137.647_1.26.wav_ASR	and i don't think so
thompson04a_139.79_1.09.wav_ASR	even i don't think
thompson04a_143.489_2.46.wav_ASR	and i saw this
thompson04a_148.632_1.73.wav_ASR	and i saw them right here

UCL02a_6.639_0.36.wav_ASR	yeah
UCL02a_11.585_0.35.wav_ASR	oh
UCL02a_13.404_4.57.wav_ASR	to just talk about my my speech and how it is today this week or
UCL02a_18.68_2.04.wav_ASR	well it could be today oh with the pen yeah
UCL02a_25.837_2.86.wav_ASR	my speech and this is tough today
UCL02a_31.699_1.62.wav_ASR	the umbrella
UCL02a_34.593_2.69.wav_ASR	well they're you don't know
UCL02a_37.33_2.09.wav_ASR	seems sometimes he's pretty good
UCL02a_39.439_0.94.wav_ASR	that's weird
UCL02a_40.4_0.93.wav_ASR	it's pretty as it is today
UCL02a_43.429_1.1.wav_ASR	slip it on to be good
UCL02a_44.544_1.86.wav_ASR	sometimes i can out and talk
UCL02a_47.789_2.6.wav_ASR	what's happening about me now
UCL02a_50.411_1.47.wav_ASR	can't
UCL02a_53.073_3.41.wav_ASR	you know these seem to be the big problem for me sometimes suddenly one word is just gone
UCL02a_56.5_1.63.wav_ASR	you know
UCL02a_58.449_1.89.wav_ASR	but just took me out there no i can't remember
UCL02a_61.489_4.3.wav_ASR	one week i think i can hear about everything
UCL02a_66.983_3.54.wav_ASR	and i can hear everything
UCL02a_70.775_5.62.wav_ASR	and then suddenly it just disappears from me now
UCL02a_77.532_0.76.wav_ASR	it's hard to tell
UCL02a_78.308_2.25.wav_ASR	sometimes suddenly one day he come be perfect
UCL02a_81.517_1.77.wav_ASR	well not perfect i mean but it's decent
UCL02a_83.309_5.47.wav_ASR	then sometimes it's i just can't hear something you know
UCL02a_88.8_1.82.wav_ASR	that's the difficult thing when with the speech
UCL02a_92.492_4.69.wav_ASR	and then until the time it's it's okay
UCL02a_97.24_3.13.wav_ASR	and then of course suddenly one word is just disappearing from me as well
UCL02a_100.812_1.34.wav_ASR	for the lucky guy
UCL02a_102.173_0.54.wav_ASR	it's okay
UCL02a_103.893_3.39.wav_ASR	and then suddenly one word is pretty for speaking to to speak ever
UCL02a_107.33_0.65.wav_ASR	it's good for me
UCL02a_108.7_2.11.wav_ASR	and then suddenly just make me so tired
UCL02a_111.006_1.62.wav_ASR	well i just kinda hear him
UCL02a_112.82_1.55.wav_ASR	it's difficult to tell you know
UCL02a_115.317_8.88.wav_ASR	yeah i wanna talk a lot
UCL02a_124.218_1.15.wav_ASR	so everything's about me as well
UCL02a_125.597_8.35.wav_ASR	three i try many times about my speaking to everybody
UCL02a_134.03_3.34.wav_ASR	it's it's pretty
UCL02a_137.419_4.91.wav_ASR	when people talk to me and then i guess the what they're talking to me is
UCL02a_142.345_3.14.wav_ASR	and i think maybe one little word is is difficult for me now
UCL02a_146.052_0.98.wav_ASR	one word just gone
UCL02a_147.699_2.65.wav_ASR	and then suddenly just tell her i can't even think
UCL02a_151.038_4.42.wav_ASR	the stroke is a little bit worse
UCL02a_155.949_12.23.wav_ASR	sometimes the bad thing is sometimes where you you you i i can't do anything for me
UCL02a_168.2_1.91.wav_ASR	that's that's been back and making it feel so good
UCL02a_171.11_1.02.wav_ASR	it's very difficult for me
UCL02a_172.344_1.12.wav_ASR	they're very difficult sometimes
UCL02a_173.565_1.16.wav_ASR	that's when he really bad with his
UCL02a_175.216_2.16.wav_ASR	you can't speak to me you know
UCL02a_177.398_0.78.wav_ASR	slap them together
UCL02a_178.199_1.64.wav_ASR	that's very different to something else like that
UCL02a_180.635_5.7.wav_ASR	and you get frustrating frustrating
UCL02a_186.35_0.66.wav_ASR	yeah
UCL02a_187.33_0.32.wav_ASR	oh yeah
UCL02a_188.404_3.4.wav_ASR	well that can be terrible sometimes
UCL02a_192.01_4.9.wav_ASR	sometimes like
UCL02a_198.705_2.08.wav_ASR	didn't fit for me but i'd look out speech as well
UCL02a_200.83_1.55.wav_ASR	so sometimes i'd no reading books
UCL02a_202.4_2.79.wav_ASR	you know before i did my stroke you know before i did my stroke
UCL02a_205.21_1.04.wav_ASR	but i read a lot of books
UCL02a_206.693_3.1.wav_ASR	now it's different for me as i'm speaking but my books to me
UCL02a_210.781_7.56.wav_ASR	and the official thing for me is sometimes i read some of my books about two pages at a time and then i come up with
UCL02a_218.619_3.13.wav_ASR	the half of the pages are reading about and then suddenly
UCL02a_222.2_2.17.wav_ASR	yes that's pretty interesting what i'm reading about that
UCL02a_224.65_1.38.wav_ASR	then suddenly one brain helps
UCL02a_226.05_0.43.wav_ASR	just gone
UCL02a_226.69_0.88.wav_ASR	it was terrible as well
UCL02a_228.468_4.2.wav_ASR	so many time when i'm reading again and i can't remember what i'm talking about the time before
UCL02a_232.729_1.01.wav_ASR	but they're terrible you know
UCL02a_234.485_8.7.wav_ASR	yeah i think we hadta have some fun and things like that for me as well
UCL02a_243.916_13.13.wav_ASR	well watching films or tv tv's sometimes i hafta watch everything to to support them
UCL02a_258.261_9.22.wav_ASR	that's hospital and i the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the
UCL02a_268.09_0.94.wav_ASR	so things are again
UCL02a_269.046_0.67.wav_ASR	that's quite good
UCL02a_270.468_3.7.wav_ASR	because i can't what they're talking about
UCL02a_274.691_5.27.wav_ASR	slippers are really good for me important for the things as well
UCL02a_282.717_3.23.wav_ASR	and then of course what happened to me with my stroke as well
UCL02a_285.97_2.58.wav_ASR	of course you know i did a lot of classic music
UCL02a_288.565_1.94.wav_ASR	that was the kind of it
UCL02a_292.355_5.18.wav_ASR	that's the all the classic classic place
UCL02a_297.553_2.03.wav_ASR	so i was living in germany and Spain and something like that
UCL02a_299.599_4.57.wav_ASR	that's one of the things i was doing as the manager of all the class in me
UCL02a_305.791_4.38.wav_ASR	at least my my classic music is there thank you
UCL02a_311.267_2.23.wav_ASR	but strange as they happened to me
UCL02a_314.212_3.28.wav_ASR	and i can hear the words perfectly about
UCL02a_317.508_1.67.wav_ASR	all the sound of the music is that
UCL02a_319.2_1.21.wav_ASR	can i hear everything perfectly
UCL02a_320.824_0.96.wav_ASR	then some time ago
UCL02a_322.053_0.66.wav_ASR	yeah it's that
UCL02a_323.079_2.0.wav_ASR	well i can hear that music
UCL02a_325.1_0.75.wav_ASR	here it is well
UCL02a_326.28_0.58.wav_ASR	but i can't say it
UCL02a_327.06_3.92.wav_ASR	you know it's been a bit of a battle and that
UCL02a_331.0_0.95.wav_ASR	and i can see what happened
UCL02a_332.315_0.63.wav_ASR	and then suddenly
UCL02a_333.511_1.24.wav_ASR	oh yeah was that the big
UCL02a_334.876_1.23.wav_ASR	it was the peanut butter's way
UCL02a_336.218_1.82.wav_ASR	that's the one word it's just gone for me
UCL02a_339.028_2.35.wav_ASR	useta get a picnic by
UCL02a_341.4_0.32.wav_ASR	let's see
UCL02a_341.803_0.93.wav_ASR	alright
UCL02a_342.829_1.91.wav_ASR	you know i can remember the word up here
UCL02a_344.964_0.93.wav_ASR	can't hear all of it
UCL02a_347.417_4.47.wav_ASR	but the classic music is well thank god for me as well
UCL02a_351.907_3.12.wav_ASR	meanthing my music there as well as i you know
UCL02a_355.5_1.15.wav_ASR	but saying just now
UCL02a_357.482_1.78.wav_ASR	and reading the books could be difficult for me
UCL02a_360.193_2.99.wav_ASR	the films i need the supplements
UCL02a_363.263_3.04.wav_ASR	but then with the music it's pretty much gone
UCL02a_367.126_5.98.wav_ASR	well the thing's happened with me and my aphasia yeah and things like that a couple of people as well
UCL02a_373.127_1.85.wav_ASR	and i mean it was a pretty nice place
UCL02a_374.999_1.1.wav_ASR	well that helps speak a little
UCL02a_376.116_0.31.wav_ASR	house
UCL02a_376.48_0.38.wav_ASR	and she's
UCL02a_377.882_5.1.wav_ASR	how do i make it
UCL02a_383.006_1.68.wav_ASR	just simple things as well you know
UCL02a_384.93_2.72.wav_ASR	some little things but what am i
UCL02a_388.125_1.06.wav_ASR	yes but it
UCL02a_394.094_1.97.wav_ASR	they met me on the airport
UCL02a_397.44_1.06.wav_ASR	what happened you know
UCL02a_399.855_1.57.wav_ASR	well i was in the office
UCL02a_402.334_3.75.wav_ASR	the it's the twenty year the fifteen years yeah
UCL02a_407.543_0.84.wav_ASR	tricycle
UCL02a_408.4_1.08.wav_ASR	yeah it's making sense today yeah
UCL02a_409.58_2.56.wav_ASR	it was four years ago
UCL02a_414.5_2.34.wav_ASR	yeah i suppose that what i really remember
UCL02a_416.862_0.77.wav_ASR	he was in the evening
UCL02a_417.65_1.01.wav_ASR	and i got to work
UCL02a_419.58_2.06.wav_ASR	and it's about nine thirty in the morning
UCL02a_422.308_1.74.wav_ASR	up close it's in the shoe
UCL02a_424.068_1.71.wav_ASR	and then i'm gonna catch my bus
UCL02a_427.382_1.25.wav_ASR	and they got there into work
UCL02a_429.05_1.69.wav_ASR	and i remember it was very strange
UCL02a_432.378_3.07.wav_ASR	and i was gonna go on to my computer
UCL02a_436.506_0.97.wav_ASR	and then suddenly
UCL02a_437.5_2.4.wav_ASR	yeah i'm gonna switch from my computer to switch it on
UCL02a_440.439_4.99.wav_ASR	and i could use my computer
UCL02a_445.929_3.87.wav_ASR	was my my code you know you're you're writing things
UCL02a_450.603_0.68.wav_ASR	come what is it
UCL02a_451.3_1.04.wav_ASR	come on
UCL02a_452.404_0.36.wav_ASR	oh
UCL02a_454.288_1.27.wav_ASR	the guy's on my coffee
UCL02a_455.628_0.46.wav_ASR	and she said
UCL02a_456.246_7.3.wav_ASR	firstnameh i can't remember how to use my computer and things like that
UCL02a_464.158_1.26.wav_ASR	and then she suddenly noticed
UCL02a_465.465_2.41.wav_ASR	and she said to me i wasn't to be scared of me as well
UCL02a_468.953_0.57.wav_ASR	that's the mother's friend
UCL02a_470.161_1.38.wav_ASR	okay and
UCL02a_471.8_0.6.wav_ASR	when i thought
UCL02a_474.207_0.79.wav_ASR	it was fine for me
UCL02a_475.017_1.76.wav_ASR	and walking around and things like that you know
UCL02a_476.8_2.11.wav_ASR	it's my brain is
UCL02a_480.117_4.99.wav_ASR	well what computer was and going downstairs and things like that
UCL02a_485.795_3.66.wav_ASR	and suddenly some friends are talking to me and they were talking to me
UCL02a_489.477_2.9.wav_ASR	what they were talking to me
UCL02a_494.892_2.06.wav_ASR	then a friend of mine firstnamel and then she said
UCL02a_497.05_1.56.wav_ASR	oh yeah i'm gonna get you sorted out as well
UCL02a_499.0_1.51.wav_ASR	and she called
UCL02a_501.025_2.43.wav_ASR	yeah but nine o'clock in the morning
UCL02a_503.787_2.13.wav_ASR	we'll take you off to the hospital

UCL02a_576.741_1.01.wav_ASR	it's about five years
UCL02a_577.773_1.11.wav_ASR	and it's it's been
UCL02a_579.236_0.55.wav_ASR	let me go
UCL02a_579.81_3.71.wav_ASR	it was quite in the evening as well in the hospital

UCL02a_605.262_2.6.wav_ASR	the first day of him
UCL02a_608.048_0.74.wav_ASR	slap it together
UCL02a_608.959_0.82.wav_ASR	he was terrible
UCL02a_609.799_0.88.wav_ASR	and i couldn't speak at all
UCL02a_610.7_0.75.wav_ASR	oh please look at me
UCL02a_611.467_0.48.wav_ASR	and i looked
UCL02a_613.201_2.54.wav_ASR	when people were talking to me
UCL02a_615.795_4.6.wav_ASR	and i couldn't when they hadta talk to me i couldn't just speak to anything

UCL02a_621.961_1.52.wav_ASR	yeah they're writing down
UCL02a_624.359_1.26.wav_ASR	september
UCL02a_625.666_1.39.wav_ASR	and i couldn't speak anything as well
UCL02a_628.52_4.16.wav_ASR	that's the worst end for about about you know but it starts about three or four weeks
UCL02a_632.699_1.28.wav_ASR	and i remember as
UCL02a_634.0_2.21.wav_ASR	oh what's the name of that
UCL02a_637.869_2.91.wav_ASR	and then after that as well
UCL02a_640.8_0.48.wav_ASR	so yes
UCL02a_641.3_2.15.wav_ASR	so m r i's uci playing here
UCL02a_644.103_1.81.wav_ASR	and then this place is the recovery from him
UCL02a_646.0_0.38.wav_ASR	slipper
UCL02a_646.4_5.93.wav_ASR	the key key key's key's square
UCL02a_652.975_4.0.wav_ASR	the new york you know
UCL02a_657.478_1.21.wav_ASR	that's the way for two weeks as well
UCL02a_659.32_1.48.wav_ASR	and they took me up and down
UCL02a_661.705_2.51.wav_ASR	so that's i mean it's not even since the day
UCL02a_664.318_1.87.wav_ASR	that's the first day they had me on the floor yeah
UCL02a_675.556_1.58.wav_ASR	that's like getting any better yeah
UCL02a_677.863_3.8.wav_ASR	it's strange
UCL02a_681.681_3.38.wav_ASR	especially the next thing for me i was about two weeks after
UCL02a_685.08_1.4.wav_ASR	the first the first we useta be
UCL02a_686.5_1.06.wav_ASR	one two three
UCL02a_687.622_3.32.wav_ASR	and then two eat the newspaper
UCL02a_691.037_1.37.wav_ASR	well i kinda see the first one as well
UCL02a_693.677_2.17.wav_ASR	and i remember that it was the first two weeks
UCL02a_695.871_6.85.wav_ASR	and then there's some people were test me up for a little bit
UCL02a_704.304_2.18.wav_ASR	and somebody was the doctor
UCL02a_706.5_3.48.wav_ASR	there's lots of tests and things like that and va
UCL02a_712.938_1.25.wav_ASR	and she's the test of me
UCL02a_714.208_1.77.wav_ASR	and you know these voices of me
UCL02a_716.0_3.65.wav_ASR	and oh these are cats
UCL02a_719.666_1.46.wav_ASR	the dog's and things like that
UCL02a_721.149_1.73.wav_ASR	what's this and some other things for me
UCL02a_723.85_4.47.wav_ASR	and sometimes i couldn't what she was talking about
UCL02a_728.336_1.86.wav_ASR	and he's just as sad to see you like the first thing
UCL02a_730.212_3.77.wav_ASR	there's a dog you know scared things and that kind of thing
UCL02a_738.114_2.95.wav_ASR	but after that about two weeks another place
UCL02a_741.126_4.6.wav_ASR	and then that was called the stroke community people as well
UCL02a_747.398_2.78.wav_ASR	the other thing was then one group of people help me up
UCL02a_750.539_5.96.wav_ASR	truck company they're helping people help me for writing some words in a while
UCL02a_757.561_3.75.wav_ASR	help me use some words
UCL02a_761.331_3.15.wav_ASR	you know it's in monday wednesday tuesday wednesday
UCL02a_764.5_1.42.wav_ASR	the first day i couldn't tell you
UCL02a_766.211_2.02.wav_ASR	he's in monday tuesday wednesday
UCL02a_768.626_0.55.wav_ASR	and i could remember
UCL02a_769.252_0.9.wav_ASR	and she had money too
UCL02a_770.176_1.63.wav_ASR	they couldn't speak the word
UCL02a_772.961_6.7.wav_ASR	it's the first day second third fourth fifth
UCL02a_779.679_0.83.wav_ASR	and when i couldn't
UCL02a_781.953_1.63.wav_ASR	well i see a lot of problems like that now
UCL02a_783.712_1.47.wav_ASR	he's one two three four five six seven
UCL02a_785.2_1.08.wav_ASR	they're not too well check in with me
UCL02a_786.37_3.78.wav_ASR	but i'm the first time i was told he's i couldn't speak
UCL02a_790.171_3.41.wav_ASR	you know what days
UCL02a_793.6_0.79.wav_ASR	oh i'm fine
UCL02a_795.524_1.21.wav_ASR	well you were my going
UCL02a_796.901_1.38.wav_ASR	and i couldn't write what things are again
UCL02a_799.104_2.08.wav_ASR	that was difficult for me as well you know
UCL02a_801.24_3.72.wav_ASR	there were some people i spoke for it's about
UCL02a_806.4_3.15.wav_ASR	it's about six years ago she was there
UCL02a_810.46_2.21.wav_ASR	every week for me some lady was talking to me
UCL02a_812.693_6.05.wav_ASR	and just you know reading some words and helping out and that
UCL02a_818.791_1.44.wav_ASR	as i said that's the about two weeks
UCL02a_821.718_4.68.wav_ASR	and then after that she said
UCL02a_826.419_1.74.wav_ASR	there's three weeks and then
UCL02a_828.767_2.69.wav_ASR	my six weeks or nine weeks as yeah
UCL02a_832.093_7.38.wav_ASR	and then i'll have my mom's and then with you at the aphasia conference
UCL02a_840.063_1.49.wav_ASR	that was you the first test as well
UCL02a_841.662_2.74.wav_ASR	spoon i suppose that was that
UCL02a_845.928_4.83.wav_ASR	think for me you know with a stroke and the stroke you see i can walk around
UCL02a_850.827_3.82.wav_ASR	well that's the big problem for me is you know and things like that
UCL02a_854.716_0.61.wav_ASR	that's okay
UCL02a_856.337_3.78.wav_ASR	you know i'm by the bus and the church and things like that

UCL02a_861.098_3.8.wav_ASR	they come a piano buy that you know bought in the shoe by myself
UCL02a_865.175_1.64.wav_ASR	or not being able to help people is well
UCL02a_867.837_2.54.wav_ASR	that's a bit weird for me
UCL02a_870.4_4.58.wav_ASR	and i think it was interesting some other people that were the same as me
UCL02a_875.2_1.96.wav_ASR	if you're by yourself it's it's okay
UCL02a_877.224_0.68.wav_ASR	he's getting wet
UCL02a_878.342_1.19.wav_ASR	and he's gonna help
UCL02a_881.28_2.41.wav_ASR	can't be worried for me sometimes
UCL02a_883.763_1.66.wav_ASR	but i'm not much better now
UCL02a_885.443_1.45.wav_ASR	but he can't be terrible you know
UCL02a_887.833_4.93.wav_ASR	but i can't speak what i'm talking about now to other people you know
UCL02a_893.03_5.1.wav_ASR	but i sposta after was that he's better for me now

UCL02a_1159.847_0.73.wav_ASR	it's strange as well
UCL02a_1160.596_0.44.wav_ASR	it's amazing
UCL02a_1161.374_2.5.wav_ASR	yeah it was ten to about thirty years ago
UCL02a_1164.139_2.9.wav_ASR	then my parents thought i gotta go back to england
UCL02a_1168.309_0.98.wav_ASR	it's the school

UCL02a_1221.964_0.68.wav_ASR	they were wrong
UCL02a_1223.734_3.25.wav_ASR	yes quite
UCL02a_1227.0_0.98.wav_ASR	it's quite strange
UCL02a_1228.41_4.07.wav_ASR	that little thing be working as well but pot holes and things like that
UCL02a_1232.5_1.32.wav_ASR	it's terrible

UCL02a_1235.413_0.57.wav_ASR	what is it
UCL02a_1236.0_0.63.wav_ASR	yeah
UCL02a_1236.684_1.21.wav_ASR	let's just try this as well yeah
UCL02a_1286.807_7.87.wav_ASR	and i just wanna a writing or something like that yeah
UCL02a_1294.873_1.09.wav_ASR	come to speech to me now
UCL02a_1305.334_0.85.wav_ASR	okay alright

wright204a_462.698_3.202.wav_ASR	oh there's lots of things you know
wright204a_466.905_2.09.wav_ASR	had a good life as a child
wright204a_469.055_1.22.wav_ASR	it was an only child
wright204a_471.226_6.03.wav_ASR	oh i i don't really know what to say
wright204a_488.482_2.61.wav_ASR	they all get a little tired
wright204a_551.677_4.2.wav_ASR	the little boy is playing with a soccer ball i guess
wright204a_556.512_3.27.wav_ASR	and he happens to hit the window
wright204a_562.435_1.63.wav_ASR	and he goes to the end
wright204a_564.087_8.98.wav_ASR	the guy inside is is the in the picture is sitting down
wright204a_573.142_3.66.wav_ASR	and it hits some i guess or at least it comes in the window
wright204a_577.402_1.19.wav_ASR	so he's got glass
wright204a_579.694_1.82.wav_ASR	and he goes
wright204a_581.882_2.06.wav_ASR	and he looks at the window
wright204a_583.994_0.79.wav_ASR	he has the ball
wright204a_584.804_8.2.wav_ASR	and apparently he's going out to see what happened and maybe let the ball go back to the little child
wright204a_611.342_0.53.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_612.361_1.49.wav_ASR	looks like it's ready for school
wright204a_614.634_3.67.wav_ASR	he's says looks like he might wanna take the umbrella
wright204a_619.559_2.09.wav_ASR	he's he's just said okay
wright204a_623.716_0.88.wav_ASR	did she say
wright204a_625.692_0.59.wav_ASR	maybe not
wright204a_626.402_0.35.wav_ASR	don't know
wright204a_626.8_2.35.wav_ASR	because now he's going to school
wright204a_629.803_0.94.wav_ASR	oh it it is
wright204a_630.763_0.47.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_633.482_1.14.wav_ASR	he's he's
wright204a_634.899_1.17.wav_ASR	oh i don't think i need it
wright204a_637.004_1.53.wav_ASR	he goes
wright204a_639.482_1.63.wav_ASR	and he must be waiting for the bus
wright204a_641.129_1.2.wav_ASR	and it's crying to the rain
wright204a_642.924_2.12.wav_ASR	so now it's coming down pretty good
wright204a_645.498_1.72.wav_ASR	so he goes back to the house
wright204a_647.796_0.36.wav_ASR	and he says
wright204a_648.654_0.66.wav_ASR	oh well
wright204a_650.019_0.33.wav_ASR	and he says
wright204a_651.289_1.3.wav_ASR	maybe i'd better go take the umbrella
wright204a_672.485_0.54.wav_ASR	let's see
wright204a_677.959_4.91.wav_ASR	looks like the cat is stuck in a tree
wright204a_683.65_0.4.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_685.27_2.21.wav_ASR	father is out on the tree
wright204a_687.552_3.18.wav_ASR	oh and he's kinda stuck himself
wright204a_691.424_2.46.wav_ASR	the little girl is crying for the cat
wright204a_694.509_1.57.wav_ASR	oh she got a umbrella
wright204a_696.668_4.34.wav_ASR	there's a dog barking up the tree
wright204a_701.845_1.46.wav_ASR	the fire department is coming
wright204a_703.403_5.75.wav_ASR	the little girl was trying to reach mine
wright204a_709.619_2.69.wav_ASR	you know she was trying to get this ladder or not
wright204a_712.623_1.35.wav_ASR	have no idea about that
wright204a_715.021_2.4.wav_ASR	but anyway
wright204a_717.541_1.03.wav_ASR	firetruck is there
wright204a_718.865_6.08.wav_ASR	and they're coming out with a ladder apparently to help get the cat and father out of the tree
wright204a_729.715_0.44.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_730.298_1.47.wav_ASR	well that's a real picture
wright204a_733.872_5.81.wav_ASR	oh this is a probably a flood storm
wright204a_740.511_1.38.wav_ASR	probably right there in arizona
wright204a_744.599_3.77.wav_ASR	the the girl was apparently wise down the river
wright204a_749.301_2.17.wav_ASR	and this is her recipe
wright204a_752.238_8.31.wav_ASR	and she is helping on to a branch
wright204a_764.718_0.38.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_772.353_0.32.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_776.476_0.63.wav_ASR	yes i do
wright204a_903.564_5.15.wav_ASR	oh she was
wright204a_911.851_7.38.wav_ASR	the the story involves around the two daughters and the what i call the the cruel
wright204a_920.645_13.21.wav_ASR	and i i couldn't remember even from looking at that what the relation ship was to the the good girl cinderella
wright204a_935.994_4.63.wav_ASR	yeah i know that she was like a servant
wright204a_941.361_9.2.wav_ASR	and had all to to was they were really putting her down
wright204a_950.842_7.62.wav_ASR	well she was always doing stuff where the other two girls were you know very nice
wright204a_958.521_3.91.wav_ASR	and was all nice and stuff for for them
wright204a_962.813_18.18.wav_ASR	when they went to the the ball it turned out that the cinderella was the one who they put the shoe on
wright204a_982.77_14.44.wav_ASR	the stagecoach was gonna turn into a pumpkin she hadta get back
wright204a_997.767_7.21.wav_ASR	and she she lost shoe
wright204a_1006.404_0.31.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_1007.312_9.14.wav_ASR	and so then when the people i guess one of the people with the the
wright204a_1018.414_1.11.wav_ASR	well i went to the doctor
wright204a_1019.765_5.209.wav_ASR	it's it's
wright204a_1026.704_2.301.wav_ASR	see this is my trouble with the story
