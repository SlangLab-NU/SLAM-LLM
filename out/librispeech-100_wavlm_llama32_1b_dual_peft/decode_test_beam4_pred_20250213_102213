6930-75918-0000	concord returned to its place amidst the tents
6930-75918-0001	the english foiled to the french baskets of flowers of which they had made a plentiful provision to greet the arrival of the young princess the french in return invited the english to a supper which was to be given the next day
6930-75918-0002	congratulations were poured in upon the princess everywhere during her journey
6930-75918-0003	from the respect paid her on all sides she seemed like a queen and from the admiration with which she was treated by two or three she appeared an object of worship the queen mother gave the french the most affectionate reception france was her native country and she had suffered too much unhappiness in england for england to have made her forget france
6930-75918-0004	she taught her daughter then by her own affection for it that love for a country where they had both been hospitably received and where a brilliant future opened for them
6930-75918-0005	the count had thrown himself back on his seat leaning his shoulders against the partition of the tent and remained thus his face buried in his hands with heaving chest and restless limbs
6930-75918-0006	this has indeed been a harassing day continued the young man his eyes fixed upon his friend
6930-75918-0007	you will be frank with me i always am
6930-75918-0008	can you imagine why buckingham has been so violent i suspect
6930-75918-0009	it is you who are mistaken raul i have read his distress in his eyes in his every gesture and action the whole day
6930-75918-0010	i can perceive love clearly enough
6930-75918-0011	i am convinced of what i say said the count
6930-75918-0012	it is annoyance then
6930-75918-0013	in those very terms i even added more
6930-75918-0014	but continued raw not interrupted by this movement of his friend heaven be praised the french who are pronounced to be thoughtless and indecent reckless even are capable of bringing a calm and sound judgment to bear on matters of such high importance
6930-75918-0015	thus it is that the honor of three is saved our country our masters and our own
6930-75918-0016	yes i need propose many things have agitated me to day both in mind and body when you return tomorrow i shall no longer be the same man
6930-75918-0017	but in this friendly pressure raw could detect the nervous agitation of a great internal conflict
6930-75918-0018	the night was clear starlit and splendid the temple had passed away and the sweet influences of the evening had restored life peace and security everywhere
6930-75918-0019	upon the large square in front of the hotel the shadows of the tents intersected by the golden moonbeams formed as it were a huge mosaic of jet and yellow flagstones
6930-75918-0020	bragolon watched for some time the conduct of the two lovers listened to the loud and unresolved slumbers of maniac camp who snored as imperiously as though he was wearing his blue and gold instead of his violet suit
6930-76324-0000	galitha makes another discovery
6930-76324-0001	they were certainly no nearer the solution of their problem
6930-76324-0002	the poor little things cried santa think of them having been turned to the wall all these years
6930-76324-0003	now what is the sense of it two innocent babies like that
6930-76324-0004	but joyce had not been listening all at once she put down her candle on the table and faced her companion
6930-76324-0005	the twin brother did something she didn't like and she turned his picture to the wall
6930-76324-0006	her's happened to be on the same frame too but she evidently didn't care about it
6930-76324-0007	now what have you to say cynthia brag
6930-76324-0008	i thought we were stumped again when i first saw that picture but it spun of some use after all
6930-76324-0009	do you suppose the minister was a copy of the same thing
6930-76324-0010	what in the world is it queried joy
6930-76324-0011	they warrant me terribly and besides i'd like to see what this lovely furniture looks like without such quantities of dust all over it good scheme sin
6930-76324-0012	we'll come in here this afternoon with old clothes on and have a regular house cleaning
6930-76324-0013	it can't hurt anything i'm sure for we won't disturb things at all
6930-76324-0014	this thought however did not enter the heads of the enthusiastic pair
6930-76324-0015	smuggling the house cleaning paraffinia into the cellar window observed that afternoon proved no easy task for cynthia had added a whisk broom and dustpan to the outfit
6930-76324-0016	the lure proved too much for him and he came sporting after it as friskily as a young kitten much to centhia's delight when she caught sight of him
6930-76324-0017	oh let him come along she urged i do love to see him about that old house
6930-76324-0018	he makes it sort of cozy
6930-76324-0019	now let's dust the furniture and pictures
6930-76324-0020	yet little as it was it had already made a vast difference in the aspect of the room
6930-76324-0021	surface dust at least had been removed and the fine old furniture gave a hint of its real elegance and polish
6930-76324-0022	then she suddenly remarked
6930-76324-0023	and my pocket money is getting low again and you have it any left as usual
6930-76324-0024	they say illumination by candle light is the prettiest in the world
6930-76324-0025	why it's california as usual they both cried peering in
6930-76324-0026	isn't he the greatest for getting into odd corners
6930-76324-0027	forgetting all their weariness they seized their candles and scurried through the house finding on occasional paper tucked away in some odd corner
6930-76324-0028	well i'm convinced that the boarded up house mystery happened not earlier than april sixteen sixteen eighteen sixty one and probably not much later
6930-81414-0000	no words were spoken no language was uttered save that of wailing and hissing and that somehow was indistinct as if it existed in fancy and not in reality
6930-81414-0001	i heard a noise behind i turned and saw cafer his black eyes shining while in his hand he held a gleaming knife he lifted it above his head as if to strike but i had the strength of ten men and i hurled him from me
6930-81414-0002	onward said a distant voice
6930-81414-0003	no sound broke the stillness of the night
6930-81414-0004	the story of its evil influence came back to me and in my bewildered condition i wondered whether there was not some truth in what had been said
6930-81414-0005	what was that
6930-81414-0006	what then a human hand large and shapely appeared distinctly on the surface of the pond
6930-81414-0007	nothing more not even the wrist to which it might be attached
6930-81414-0008	it did not beckon or indeed move at all it was as still as the hand of death
6930-81414-0009	i awoke to consciousness fighting at first it seemed as if i were fighting with the phantom but gradually my opponent became more real to me it was cafer
6930-81414-0010	a sound of voices a flash of light
6930-81414-0011	feeling of freedom and i was awake where
6930-81414-0012	said another voice which i recognized as voltaire's caffir
6930-81414-0013	i had scarcely known what i had been saying or doing up to this time but as he spoke i looked at my hand
6930-81414-0014	in the light of the moon i saw a knife red with blood and my hand too was also discolored
6930-81414-0015	do not know i am dazed bewildered
6930-81414-0016	but that is cafer's knife
6930-81414-0017	i know he had it this very evening
6930-81414-0018	i remembered saying have we been together
6930-81414-0019	butcher picked up something from the ground and looked at it
6930-81414-0020	i say you do know what this means and you must tell us
6930-81414-0021	a terrible thought flashed into my mind
6930-81414-0022	i had again been acting under the influence of this man's power
6930-81414-0023	per chance too caffir's death might serve him in good stead
6930-81414-0024	my tongue refused to articulate my power of speech left me
6930-81414-0025	my position was too terrible
6930-81414-0026	my over wrought nerves yielded at last
6930-81414-0027	for some time after that i remembered nothing distinctly
1320-122617-0000	 notwithstanding the high resolution of hacky he fully comprehended all the difficulties and danger he was about to incur
1320-122617-0001	in his return to the camp his acute and practised intellect were occasionally engaged in devising means to counteract a watchfulness and suspicion on the part of his enemies that he knew were in no degree inferior to his own
1320-122617-0002	in other words while he had implicit faith in the ability of balam's ass to speak he were somewhat sceptical on the subject of a bear's singing and yet he had been assured of the latter on the testimony of his own exquisite organs
1320-122617-0003	there were something in his air and manner that betrayed to the scout the utter confusion of the state of his mind
1320-122617-0004	the ingenious hawk eye who recalled the hasty manner in which the other had abandoned his post at the bedside of the sick woman was not without his suspicions concerning the subject of so much solemn deliberation
1320-122617-0005	the bear shook his shaggy sides and then a well known voice replied
1320-122617-0006	can these things be returned david breathing more freely as the truth began to dawn upon him
1320-122617-0007	come come returned hawky uncasing his honest countenance the better to assure the wavering confidence of his companion you may see a skin which if it be not as white as one of the gentle ones has no tinge of red to it that the winds of the heaven and the sun have not bestowed now let us to business
1320-122617-0008	the young man is in bondage and much i fear his death is decreed
1320-122617-0009	i gratefully mourn that one so well disposed should die in his ignorance and i have sought a goodly him can you lead me to him
1320-122617-0010	the task will not be difficult returned david hesitating though i greatly fear your presence would rather increase than mitigate his unhappy fortunes
1320-122617-0011	the lodge in which oakes was confined was in the very center of the village and in a situation perhaps more difficult than any other to approach or leave without observation
1320-122617-0012	four or five of the latter only lingered about the door of the prison of uncas weary but close observers of the manner of their captive
1320-122617-0013	delivered in a strong tone of assent announced the gratification the savage would receive in witnessing such an exhibition of weakness and an enemy so long hated and so much feared
1320-122617-0014	they drew back a little from the entrance and motioned to the supposed conjurer to enter
1320-122617-0015	but the bear instead of obeying maintained the seat it had taken and growled
1320-122617-0016	the cunning man is afraid that his breath will blow upon his brothers and take away their courage too continued david approving the hint he received they must stand further off
1320-122617-0017	then as if satisfied of their safety the scout left his position and slowly entered the place
1320-122617-0018	it was silent and gloomy being tenanted solely by the captive and lighted by the dying embers of a fire which had been used for the purpose of cookery
1320-122617-0019	uncas occupied a distant corner in a reclining attitude being rigidly bound both hands and feet by strong and painful whists
1320-122617-0020	the scout who had left david at the door to ascertain they were not observed thought it prudent to reserve his disguise until assured of their privacy
1320-122617-0021	what shall we do with the minnows at the door they count six and the singer is as good as nothing
1320-122617-0022	the delawares are children of the tortoise and they outstrip the deer
1320-122617-0023	uncas who had already approached the door in readiness to lead the way now recoiled and placed himself once more in the bottom of the lodge
1320-122617-0024	but hacky who was too much occupied with his own thoughts to note the movement continued speaking more to himself than to his companion
1320-122617-0025	so unkiss you had better take the lead while i will put on the skin again and trust to cunning for want of speed
1320-122617-0026	well what can't be done by mane courage in war must be done by circumvention
1320-122617-0027	as soon as these dispositions were made the scout turned to david and gave him his parting instructions
1320-122617-0028	my pursuits are peaceful and my temper i humbly trust is greatly given to mercy and love returned david a little nettled at so direct an attack on his manhood but there are none who can say that i have ever forgotten my faith in the lord even in the greatest straits
1320-122617-0029	if you are not then knocked on the head you being a non compositor will protect you and you'll then have a good reason to expect to die in your bed
1320-122617-0030	so choose for yourself to make a rush or tarry here
1320-122617-0031	bravely and generously has he battled in my behalf and this and more will i dare in his service
1320-122617-0032	keep silent as long as may be and it would be wise when you do speak to break out suddenly in one of your shoutings which will serve to remind the indians that you are not altogether as responsible as men should be
1320-122617-0033	if however they take your scalp as i trust and believe they will not depend on it unicus and i will not forget the deed but revenge it as becomes true warriors and trusty friends
1320-122617-0034	hold said david perceiving that with this assurance they were about to leave him i am an unworthy and humble follower of one who taught not the damnable principle of revenge
1320-122617-0035	then heaving a heavy sigh probably among the last he ever drew in pining for a condition he had so long abandoned he added it is what i would wish to practice myself as one without a cross of blood though it is not always easy to deal with an indian as you would with a fellow christian
1320-122617-0036	god bless you friend i do believe your scent has not greatly wrong when the matter is duly considered and keeping etiquette before the eyes though much depends on the natural gifts and the force of temptation
1320-122617-0037	the delaware dog he said leaning forward and peering through the dim light to catch the expression of the other's features is he afraid
1320-122617-0038	will the hurons hear his groans
1320-122617-0039	the mohican started on his feet and shook his shaggy covering as though the animal he counterfitted was about to make some desperate effort
1320-122617-0040	he had no occasion to delay for at the next instant a burst of cries filled the outer air and ran along the whole extent of the village
1320-122617-0041	uncas cast his skin and stepped forth in his own beautiful proportions
1320-122612-0000	since the period of our tale the active spirit of the country has surrounded it with a belt of rich and thriving settlements though none but the hunter or the savage is ever known even now to penetrate its wild recesses
1320-122612-0001	the deuce were suffered to exile and the sun had dispersed the mists and was shedding a strong and clear light in the forest when the travelers resumed their journey
1320-122612-0002	after proceeding a few miles the progress of hacky who led the advance became more deliberate and watchful
1320-122612-0003	he often stopped to examine the trees nor did he cross a rivulet without attentively considering the quantity the velocity and the color of its waters
1320-122612-0004	distressing his own judgment his appeals to the opinion of chingacho were frequent and earnest
1320-122612-0005	yet here are we within a short range of the skirruons and not a sign of a trail have we crossed
1320-122612-0006	let us retrace our steps and examine as we go with cleaner eyes
1320-122612-0007	ching grouch had caught the look and motioning with his hand he bade him speak
1320-122612-0008	the eyes of the whole party followed the unexpected movement and read their success in the air of triumph that the youth assumed
1320-122612-0009	it would have been more wonderful had he spoken without a biting
1320-122612-0010	see said onyx pointing north and south at the evident marks of the broad trail on either side of him the dark hair has gone toward the forest
1320-122612-0011	if a rock or a rivulet or a bit of earth harder than common severed the links of the clew they followed the true eye of the scout recovered them at a distance and seldom rendered the delay of a single moment necessary
1320-122612-0012	extinguished bands were lying around a spring the oaths of a deer were scattered about the place and the trees bore evident marks of having been browsed by the horses
1320-122612-0013	a circle of a few hundred feet in circumference was drawn and each of the party took a segment for his portion
1320-122612-0014	the examination however resulted in no discovery
1320-122612-0015	the whole party crowded to the spot where uncas pointed out the impression of a moccasin in the moist olive
1320-122612-0016	run back uncas and bring me the size of the singer's foot
5639-40744-0000	eleven o'clock had struck it was a fine clear night there were the only persons on the road and they sauntered leisurely along to avoid paying the price of fatigue for the recreation provided for the tolentines in the valley or on the banks of their river
5639-40744-0001	secure as he thought in the careful administration of justice in that city and the character of its well disposed inhabitants the good hadalgio was far from thinking that any disaster could befall his family
5639-40744-0002	rudolph and his companions with their faces muffled in their cloaks stared rudely and insolently at the mother the daughter and the servant maid
5639-40744-0003	in a moment he communicated his thoughts to his companions and in the next moment they resolved to turn back and carry that decision into effect was the work of a moment
5639-40744-0004	they drew their swords hid their faces in the flaps of their cloaks turned back and soon came in front of the little party who had not yet done giving thanks to god for their escape from those odacious men
5639-40744-0005	finally the one party went off exaltation and the other was left in desolation and woe
5639-40744-0006	rudolpho arrived at his own house without any impediment and elocadia's parents reached theirs heartbroken and despairing
5639-40744-0007	meanwhile rudolph had leopatra safe in his custody and in his own apartment
5639-40744-0008	who touches me am i in bed
5639-40744-0009	mother dear father do you hear me
5639-40744-0010	it is the only amends i ask of you for the wrong you have done me
5639-40744-0011	she found the door but it was locked outside
5639-40744-0012	she succeeded in opening the window and the moonlight shone in so brightly that she could distinguish the color of some damask hanging in the room
5639-40744-0013	she saw that the bed was gilded and so rich that it seemed that of a prince rather than of a private
5639-40744-0014	among other things on which she cast her eyes was a small crucifix of solid silver standing on a cabinet near the window
5639-40744-0015	this person was redralf who though he had gone to look for his friends had changed his mind in that respect not thinking it advisable to acquaint them with what had passed between him and the girl
5639-40744-0016	on the contrary he resolved to tell them that repenting of his violence and moved by a tears he had only carried her halfway toward his house and then let her go
5639-40744-0017	chocking with emotion locadia made a sign to her parents that she wished to be alone with them
5639-40744-0018	that would be very well my child replied her father if your plan were not liable to be frustrated by ordinary cunning but no doubt this image had been already missed by its owner and he will have set it down for certain that it was taken out of the room by the person he locked up there
5639-40744-0019	what you had best do my child is to keep it and pray to it that since it was a witness to your undoing it will decay to vindicate your cause by its righteous judgment
5639-40744-0020	thus did the humane and right minded father comfort his unhappy daughter and her mother embracing her again did all she could to soothe the feelings
5639-40744-0021	she meanwhile passed her life with her parents in the strictest retirement never letting herself be seen but shunning every eye lest it should read her misfortune in her face
5639-40744-0022	time rolled on the hour of her delivery arrived it took place in the utmost secrecy her mother taking upon her the office of midwife and she gave birth to a son one of the most beautiful ever seen
5639-40744-0023	when the boy walked through the streets blessings were showered upon him by all who saw him blessing upon his beauty upon the mother that bore him upon the father that begotten him upon those who brought him up so well
5639-40744-0024	one day when the boy was sent by his grandfather with a message to a relation he passed along a street in which there was a great concourse of horsesmen
5639-40744-0025	the bed she too well remembered was there and above all the cabinet on which had stood the image she had taken away was still on the same spot
5639-40744-0026	luce was out of danger in a fortnight in a month he rose from his bed and during all that time he was visited daily by his mother and grandmother and treated by the master and mistress of the house as if he were their own child
5639-40744-0027	thus saying and pressing the crucifix to her breast she fell fainting into the arms of dona justina who as a gentlewoman to whom sex is a natural as cruelty as to man instantly pressed her lips to those of the fading girl shedding over her so many tears that there needed no other sprinkling of water to recover deocadia from her swoon
5639-40744-0028	i have great things to tell you signor said donostafania to her husband the cream and substance of which is this the fainting girl before you is your daughter and the boy is your grandson
5639-40744-0029	this truth which i have learned from her lips is confirmed by his face in which we both beheld that of our son
5639-40744-0030	just then leocadia came to herself and embracing the cross seemed changed into a sea of tears and the gentleman remaining in utter bewilderment until his wife had repeated to him from beginning to end leocadia's whole story and he believed it through the blessed dispensation of heaven which had confirmed it by so many convincing testimonies
5639-40744-0031	so persuasive were her entreaties and so strong her assurance that no harm whatever could result to them from the information she sought they were concerned in the abduction of a girl whom rudolph carried off whereas the rest of them detained her family who made a great outcry and would have defended her if they could
5639-40744-0032	for god's sake my lady mother give me a wife who would be agreeable companion not one who will discuss me so that we may both bear evenly and with mutual goodwill the yoke imposed on us by heaven instead of pulling this way and that way and fretting each other to death
5639-40744-0033	her bearing was graceful and animated she led her son by the hand and before her walked two maids with wax lights and silver candlesticks
5639-40744-0034	all rose to do her reverence as if something from heaven had miraculously appeared before them but gazing on her enthroned with admiration not one of them was able to address a single word to her
5639-40744-0035	she reflected how near she stood to the crises which were to determine whether she was to be blessed or unhappy forever and racked by the intensity of her emotions she suddenly changed color her head dropped and she fell forward into the swoon into the arms of the dismayed ifania
5639-40744-0036	his mother had left her to him as being her distant protector but when she saw that he too was insensible she was near making a third and would have done so had he not come to himself
5639-40744-0037	now then son of my heart that this fading lady is your real bride i say real because she is the one whom you father and i have chosen for you and the portrait was a pretence
5639-40744-0038	just at the moment when the tears of the pitting beholders flowed fastest and their ejaculations were most expressive of despair leocadia gave signs of recovery and brought back gladness to the hearts of all
5639-40744-0039	when she came to her senses and blushing to find herself in rudolph's arms would have disengaged herself no signor he said that must not be strive not to withdraw from the arms of him who holds you in his sole
5639-40744-0040	this was done for the event took place at a time when the consent of the parties was sufficient for the celebration of a marriage without any of the preliminary formalities which are now so properly required
5639-40744-0041	now was rudolph less surprised than they and the better to assure himself of so wonderful a fact he begged lucadia to give him some token which should perfectly clear to him that which indeed he did not doubt since it was authenticated by his parents
260-123440-0000	and how odd the directions will look
260-123440-0001	poor alice
260-123440-0002	it was the white rabbit returning splendidly dressed with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other he came trotting along in a great hurry muttering to himself as he came oh the duchess the duchess
260-123440-0003	oh won't she be savage if i've kept her waiting
260-123440-0004	alice took up the fan and gloves and as the hall was very hot she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking dear dear how queer everything is to day
260-123440-0005	and yesterday things went on just as usual
260-123440-0006	i wonder if i've been changed in the night
260-123440-0007	i almost think i can remember feeling a little different

260-123440-0009	i shall never get to twenty at that rate
260-123440-0010	how cheerfully he seems to grin how neatly spread his claws and welcome little fishes in with gently smiling jaws
260-123440-0011	now i made up my mind about it if i mabel i'll stay down here
260-123440-0012	it will be no use there putting their heads down and saying come up again dear
260-123440-0013	im so very tired of being all alone here
260-123440-0014	and i declare it's too bad that it is
260-123440-0015	i wish i hadn't cried so much said alice as she swam about trying to find her way out
260-123440-0016	i shall be punished for it now i suppose by being drowned in my own tears
260-123440-0017	that will be a queer thing for to be sure
260-123440-0018	i am very tired of swimming about here o mouse
260-123440-0019	cried alice again for this time the mouse was bristling all over and she felt certain it must be really offended
260-123440-0020	we won't talk about her any more if you'd rather not we indeed
260-123286-0000	Saturday august fifteenth the sea unbroken all round no land in sight
260-123286-0001	the horizon seems extremely distant
260-123286-0002	all my danger and sufferings were needed to strike a spark of human feeling out of him but now that i am well his nature has resumed its sway
260-123286-0003	you seem anxious my uncle i said seeing him continually with his glass to his eye anxious
260-123286-0004	one might be with less reason than now
260-123286-0005	i am not complaining that the raid is slow but that the sea is so wide
260-123286-0006	we are losing time and the fact is i have not come all this way to take a little sail upon a pond on a raft
260-123286-0007	he called this sea upon and our long voyage taking a little sail
260-123286-0008	therefore don't talk to me about views and prospects
260-123286-0009	i take this as my answer and i leave the professor to bite his lips with impatience
260-123286-0010	unday august sixteen
260-123286-0011	nothing new weather unchanced the wind fountains
260-123286-0012	but there seemed no reason to fear
260-123286-0013	the shadow of the raft was clearly outlined upon the surface of the waves
260-123286-0014	too the sea is of infinite width
260-123286-0015	it must be as wide as the mediterranean or the atlantic and why not
260-123286-0016	these thoughts agitated me all day and my imagination scarcely camed down after several hours sleep
260-123286-0017	shudder as i recall these monsters to my remembrance
260-123286-0018	i saw at the hampered museum the skeleton of one of these creatures thirty feet in length
260-123286-0019	i suppose professor leidenbrock was of my opinion too and even shared my fears for after having examined the pick his eyes traversed the ocean from side to side
260-123286-0020	two day august eighteen
260-123286-0021	during his watch i slept
260-123286-0022	two hours afterwards a terrible shock awaked me
260-123286-0023	the raft was heaved up on a watery mountain and pitched down again at a distance of twenty fathoms
260-123286-0024	there's a whale a whale cried the professor
260-123286-0025	flight was out of the question now the reptiles rose they whiled around our little raft with a rapidity greater than that of escape trains
260-123286-0026	two monsters only were creating all this commotion and before my eyes are two reptiles of the primitive world
260-123286-0027	i can distinguish the eye of the ichthyosaur glowing like a red hot co and as large as a man's head
260-123286-0028	its jaw is enormous and according to naturalists it is armed with no less than one hundred and eighty two teeth
260-123286-0029	those huge creatures attacked each other with the greatest animosity
260-123286-0030	uddenly the ichthyosaurs and the pleiocenesaurus disappear below leaving a whirlpool eddying in the water
260-123286-0031	as for the ithyasis has he returned to his submarine cabin
260-123288-0000	the roars become lost in the distance
260-123288-0001	the weather if we may use the term will change before long
260-123288-0002	the atmosphere is charged with vapours pervaded with the electricity generated by the evaporation of sealing waters
260-123288-0003	the electric light can scarcely penetrate through the dense curtain which is dropped over the theatre on which the battle of the elements is about to be waged
260-123288-0004	the air is heavy the sea is calm
260-123288-0005	from time to time a fleecey tuft of miss with yet some gleaming light left upon it drops down upon the dense floor of gray and loses itself in the opaque mass
260-123288-0006	the atmosphere as evidently charged and surcharged with electricity
260-123288-0007	the wind never lulls but to acquire increase strength the vast bank of heavy clouds is a huge reservoir of fearful windy gusts and rushing storms
260-123288-0008	there's a heavy storm coming on i cried pointing toward the horizon
260-123288-0009	those clouds seem as if they were going to crush the sea
260-123288-0010	on the mast already i see the light play of alamont saint evel's fire the outstretched sail catches not a breath of wind and hangs like a sheet of lead
260-123288-0011	but if we have now ceased to advance why do we yet leave that seal loose which at the first shock of a tempest may capsize us in a moment
260-123288-0012	that will be the safest no no never
260-123288-0013	the polished vapours condensed into water and the air put into a violent action to supply the vacuum left by the conduction of the mist rouses itself into a whirlwind
260-123288-0014	han stirs not
260-123288-0015	from the surface of the clouds there are continual emissions of lurid light electric matter is in continual evolution from their composite molecules the gasic elements of the air need to be slaked with moisture for innumerable columns of water rush upwards into the air and fall back again in white foam
260-123288-0016	i refer to the thermometer it indicates the figure is obliterated
260-123288-0017	is the atmosphere condition having once reached density to become final
260-123288-0018	the raft bears on still to the south east
260-123288-0019	at noon the violence of the storm redoubles
260-123288-0020	each of us is lashed to some part of the raft
260-123288-0021	the waves rise above our heads
260-123288-0022	they seem to be we are lost but i am not sure
260-123288-0023	he nods his consent
260-123288-0024	the fireball half of it white half asere blue and the size of a ten inch shell moves slowly about the raft but revolving on its own axis with astonishing velocity as if whipped round by the force of the whirlwind
260-123288-0025	here it comes there it glides now it is up the ragged stump of the mast thence it lightly leaps on the provision bag descends with a light bound and just skims the powder magazine horrible
260-123288-0026	we shall be blown up but no the dazzling disk of mysterious light nimble leaps aside it approaches hans who fixes his blue eye upon it steadily it threatens the head of my uncle who falls upon his knees with his head down to avoid it
260-123288-0027	a suffocating smell of nitrogen fills the air it enters the throat it fills the lungs
260-123288-0028	we suffer stifling pains
7729-102255-0000	the bug's legislation numbered thirty six members
7729-102255-0001	this was at the march election eighteen fifty five
7729-102255-0002	that summer's immigration however being mainly from the free states greatly changed the relative strengths of the two parties
7729-102255-0003	for general service therefore requiring no special effort the numerical strength of the factions was about equal while on external occasions the two thousand boardruffian reserve lying a little farther back from the state line could at any time easily turn the scale
7729-102255-0004	the free state men had only their convictions their intelligence their courage and the moral support of the north the conspiracy had its secret combination the territorial officials the legislative the bureaucracy the courts the militia officers the president and the army
7729-102255-0005	this was a formidable array of advantages slavery was playing with loaded dice
7729-102255-0006	come by way of the moseri river towns he fell first among board ruffian companions and influences and perhaps having his inclinations already molded by his washington instructions his early impressions were decidedly adverse to the free state cause
7729-102255-0007	his reception speech at westport in which he maintained the legality of the legislation and his determination to enforce their laws delighted his pro slavery auditors
7729-102255-0008	all the territorial dignaries were present governor shannon presided john calhoun the surveyor general made the principal speech a denunciation of the abolitionist supporting the typographical movement chief justice laconcteign distinguished the occasion with approving remarks
7729-102255-0009	all descent all noncomplacency all mere silence even were in their stronghold towns like levynworth branded as abolitionism declared to be hospitality to the public welfare and purchased with prescription personal violence expulsion and frequently death
7729-102255-0010	of the lynchings the mobs and the murders it would be impossible except in a very extended work to note the frequent and atrocious details
7729-102255-0011	the present chapters can only touch upon the more salient movements of the civil war in cans which happily or not sandwich if however the individual and more isolated cases of bloodshed could be described they would show a startling aggregate of barbarity and a loss of life for opinion's sake
7729-102255-0012	several hundred free state men promptly responded to the summons
7729-102255-0013	it was in fact the best weapon of its day
7729-102255-0014	the leaders of the conspiracy became distrustful of their power to crush the town
7729-102255-0015	one of his militia generals suggested that the governor should require the outlaws at london and elsewhere to surrender the sharks rifles another wrote asking him to call out the government troops at fort levinworth
7729-102255-0016	the governor on his part becoming doubtful of the legality of employing moseley militia to enforce canvas laws was also eager to secure the help of federal troops
7729-102255-0017	sheriff jones had his pockets always full of rints issued in the spirit of persecution but was often baffled by the sharp wits and ready resources of the free state people and sometimes defied outright
7729-102255-0018	little by little however the latter became hemmed and bound in the meshes of the various devices and proceedings which the territorial officials involved from the bogus laws
7729-102255-0019	to embarrass this damaging exposure judge laconp issued a writ against the ex governor on a frivolous charge of contempt
7729-102255-0020	the incident was not violent nor even dramatic no posse was summoned no further effort made and reader fearing personal violence soon fled in disguise
7729-102255-0021	but the affair was magnified as a crowning proof that the free state men were insurrectionists and outlawed
7729-102255-0022	from these again sprang barricaded and fortified dwellings camps and scout parties finally culminating in roving guerrilla bands half partisan half predatory
7729-102255-0023	their distinct characters however display one broad and unfailing difference
7729-102255-0024	the freestate men clung to their prairie towns and prairies with all the obstinacy and courage of true defenders of their homes and firesides
7729-102255-0025	their assumed character changed with their changing opportunities or necessities
7729-102255-0026	in the shooting of sheriff jones in louis and in the refusal of ex governor reeder to allow the deputy marshal to arrest him they discovered grave affences against the territorial and the united states laws
7729-102255-0027	footnote somner to shannon mae twelve eighteen fifty six
7729-102255-0028	private persons who had leased the free state hotel vainly besought the various authorities to present the destruction of their property
7729-102255-0029	ten days were consumed in these negotiations but the spirit of vengeance refused to yield
7729-102255-0030	he summoned half a dozen citizens to join his party who followed obeyed and assisted him
7729-102255-0031	he continued his pretended search and to give color to his errand made two arrests
7729-102255-0032	the free state hotel a stone building in dimensions fifty by seventy feet three stories high and handsomely furnished previously occupied only for lodging rooms on that day for the first time opened its table accommodations to the public and provided a free dinner in honor of the occasion
7729-102255-0033	as he had promised to protect the hotel the reassured citizens began to laugh at their own fears
7729-102255-0034	to their sorrow they were soon undeceived
7729-102255-0035	the military force partly rabid partly organized had meanwhile moved into the town
7729-102255-0036	he planted a company before the hotel and demanded a surrender of the arms belonging to the free state military companies
7729-102255-0037	half an hour later turning a deaf ear to all remonstrances he gave the proprietors until five o'clock to remove their families and personal property from the free state hotel
7729-102255-0038	axton who had been hurrahing the mob planted his two guns before the building and trained them upon it
7729-102255-0039	the inmates being removed at the appointed hour a few cannonballs were fired through the stone walls
7729-102255-0040	in this incident contrasting the creative and the descriptive spirit of the facts the eminent aid society of massachusetts finds its most honorable and triumphant vindication
7729-102255-0041	the whole proceeding was so childish the miserable plot so transparent the outraged so gross as to bring disgust to the better class of border ruthians who were witnesses and executors
7729-102255-0042	relocated footnote governor robinson being on his way east the steam boat on which he was traveling stopped at lexington mizury
7729-102255-0043	in a few days an officer came with a requisition from governor shannon and took the prisoner by land to westport and afterwards from there to canada city leavenworth
7729-102255-0044	here he was placed in the custody of captain martin of the kikapu Rangers who proved a kind jailer and materially assisted in protecting him from the dangerous intentions of the mob which at that time held levinworth under the reign of terror
7729-102255-0045	captain martin said i shall give you a pistol to help protect yourself if west comes to worst
7729-102255-0046	in the early morning of the next day may twenty nine a company of dragoons with one empty saddle came down from the fort and while the proslavery men still slept the prisoner and his escort were on their way across the prairies to laconium in the charge of officers of the united states army
2094-142345-0000	it is a very fine old place of red brick softened by a pale powdery limestone which has dispersed itself with happy irregularity so as to bring the red brick into terms of friendly conservatism with the limestone ornaments surrounding the three gables the windows and the door place
2094-142345-0001	but the windows are patched with wooden pans and the door i think is like the gate it is never opened
2094-142345-0002	for it is a solid heavy handsome door and must once have been in the habit of shudding with a sonorous bang behind the liveried lackey who had just seen his master and mistress off the grounds in a carriage and pair
2094-142345-0003	a large open fireplace with rusty dogs in it and a bare bordered floor at the far end fleaces of wool stacked up in the middle of the floor some empty corn bags
2094-142345-0004	and what through the left hand window
2094-142345-0005	several closets a pillon a spinning wheel and an old box wide open and stuffful of colored raggs
2094-142345-0006	at the edge of this box there lies a great wooden doll which so far as mutation is concerned bears a strong resemblance to the finest greek sculpture and especially in the total loss of its nose
2094-142345-0007	the history of the house is plain now
2094-142345-0008	but there is always a stronger sense of life when the sun is brilliant after rain and now he is pouring down his beams and making sparks among the wet straw and lighting up every patch of vivid green moss on the red tiles of the cow shed and turning even the muddy water that is hurrying along the channel to the drain with as much body in it as possible
2094-142345-0009	for the great barn doors are thrown wide open and men are busy there mending the harness under the superintendence of mister goby the whitmore otherwise saddler who entertains them with the latest trudenton gossip
2094-142345-0010	hetty sorrel often took the opportunity when her aunt's back was turned of looking at the pleasing reflection of herself in those polished surfaces that were arranged on the shelves above the long deal dinner table or in the hobbs of the grate which always shone like jasper
2094-142345-0011	do not suppose however that missus poyser was elderly or shrewish in her appearance she was a good looking woman not more than eight and thirty of fair complexion and sandy hair well shaped light footed
2094-142345-0012	the family likeness between her and her niece dina morris with a contrast between her keenness and dinas sarcastic gentleness of expression might have served a painter as an excellent suggestion for amartha and mery
2094-142345-0013	her tongue was not less keen than her eye and whenever a damsel came within earshot seemed to take up an unfinished lecture as a barrel organ takes up a tune precisely at the point where it had left off
2094-142345-0014	the fact that it was churning day was another reason why it was inconvenient to have the widows and why consequently missus poyser should scold molly the housemaid with unusual severity
2094-142345-0015	to all appearance molly had got through her afternoon dinner work in an exemplary manner had cleansed herself with great dispatch and now came to ask submissively if she should sit down to her spinning till milking time
2094-142345-0016	spinning indeed
2094-142345-0017	never knew your equals for gallowsess
2094-142345-0018	who taught you to scrub a floor i should like to know
2094-142345-0019	come the wool for the whitewash indeed
2094-142345-0020	that's what you'd like to be doing is it
2094-142345-0021	that's the way with you that's the road you'd all like to go headlongs to ruin
2094-142345-0022	master oatley's indeed
2094-142345-0023	you are a raven for sitting down to your work a little while after it's time to put by
2094-142345-0024	money my earnings twain hold peep it down to warm
2094-142345-0025	cold is it my darling bless your sweet face
2094-142345-0026	she's going to put the ironing things away
2094-142345-0027	money i'd like to do into the barn to tommy to see the widow
2094-142345-0028	no no no todd had get her feet wet said missus poyser caring away her iron
2094-142345-0029	did ever anybody see the like screamed missus poyser running towards the table when her eye had fallen on the blue stream
2094-142345-0030	taudy however had descended from her chair with great swiftness and was already in retreat towards the dairy with a sort of waddling run and an amount of fat on the nap of her neck which made her look like the metamorphosis of a white succulent pig
2094-142345-0031	and she was very fond of you too aunt rachel
2094-142345-0032	i often heard her talk of you in the same sort of way
2094-142345-0033	when she had that bad illness and i was only eleven years old she used to say you'll have a friend on earth and your aunt rachel if i'm taken from you for she has a kind heart and i am sure i've found it so
2094-142345-0034	and there's linen in the house as i could well spare you for i got lots of sheathing and table clothing and tawling as isn't made up
2094-142345-0035	but not more than what's in the bible andt said dina
2094-142345-0036	neigh dear aunt you never heard me say that all people are called to forsake their work and their families
2094-142345-0037	we can all be servants of god wherever our lot is cast but he gives us different sorts of work accordingly as he fits us for it and calls us to it
2094-142345-0038	i can no more help spending my life and trying to do what i can for the souls of others then you could help running if you heard little taylor crying at the other end of the house the voice would go to your heart you would think the dear child was in trouble or in danger and you couldn't rest without running to help her and comfort her
2094-142345-0039	i have strong assurance that no evil will happen to you and my uncle and the children from anything i have done
2094-142345-0040	i didn't preach without direction
2094-142345-0041	direction
2094-142345-0042	ah have a common patience with you
2094-142345-0043	by this time the two gentlemen had reached the palings and had got down from their horses it was plain they meant to come in
2094-142345-0044	said mister irwin with his stately cordiality
2094-142345-0045	oh sir don't mention it said missus poyser
2094-142345-0046	i delay in your kitchen
2094-142345-0047	poisoner is not at home is he
2094-142345-0048	said captain donny thorne seating himself where he could see along the short passage to the open dairy door
2094-142345-0049	now sir he isn't he's gone to rochester to see mister west the factor about the wool
2094-142345-0050	but there's father in barn sir if he'd be of any use
2094-142345-0051	now thank you i'll just look at the welps and leave a message about them with your shepherd
2094-142345-0052	i must come another day and see your husband i want to have a consultation with him about horses
2094-142345-0053	for if he's anywhere on the farm we can send for him in a minute
2094-142345-0054	oh sir said missus poyser rather alarmed you wouldn't like it at all
2094-142345-0055	but you know more about that than i do sir
2094-142345-0056	i think i should be doing you a service to turn you out of such a place
2094-142345-0057	know his farm isn't in better order than any other within ten miles of us and as for the kitchen he added smiling i don't believe there's one in the kingdom to beat it
2094-142345-0058	by the bye i've never seen your dairy i must see your dairy missus poyser
2094-142345-0059	this missus poyser said blushing and believing that the captain was really interested in her milk pans and would adjust his opinion of her to the appearance of her dairy
2094-142345-0060	oh i've no doubt it's incidental order
3575-170457-0000	and often has my mother said while on her lap i laid my head she feared for time i was not made but for eternity
3575-170457-0001	why are we to be denied each other's society
3575-170457-0002	why are we to be divided
3575-170457-0003	surely it must be because we are in danger of loving each other too well of losing sight of the creator and idolatry of the creature
3575-170457-0004	we used to dispute about politics and religion
3575-170457-0005	she a torpedoed civilian's daughter was always in a minority of one in our house of violent dissent and radicalism
3575-170457-0006	her feeble health gave her her yielding manner for she could never oppose any one without gathering up all her strength for the struggle
3575-170457-0007	he spoke french perfectly i have been told when need was but delighted usually in talking the broadest yorkshire
3575-170457-0008	and so life and death have dispersed the circle of violent ruddles and descents into which twenty years ago the little quiet resolute clergyman's daughter was received and by whom she was truly loved and honored
3575-170457-0009	january and february of eighteen thirty seven had passed away and still there was no reply from cely
3575-170457-0010	i am not describing it when i say that in these times it is not rare
3575-170457-0011	but it is not with a view to distinction that you should cultivate this talent if you consult your own happiness
3575-170457-0012	you will say that a woman has no need of such a caution there can be no peril in it for her
3575-170457-0013	the more she is engaged in our proper duties the less leisure will she have for it even as an accomplishment and a recreation
3575-170457-0014	to those duties you have not yet been called and when you are you will be less eager for solitude
3575-170457-0015	but do not suppose that i disparage the gift which you possess nor that i would discourage you from exercising it only exhaust you so to think of it and so to use it as to render it conducive to your own permanent good
3575-170457-0016	farewell madame
3575-170457-0017	though i may be but an ungracious advisor you will allow me therefore to describe myself with the best wishes for your happiness here and hereafter your true friend robert southey
3575-170457-0018	ser march sixteen
3575-170457-0019	have not ventured to hope for such a reply so considerate in its tone so noble in its spirit
3575-170457-0020	i know the first letter i wrote to you is all senseless trash from beginning to end but i am not altogether the idle dreaming being it would seem to denote
3575-170457-0021	i thought it therefore my duty when i left school to become a governess
3575-170457-0022	in the evenings i confess i do think but i never trouble any one else with my thoughts
3575-170457-0023	i carefully avoid any appearance of prostitution and excessivity which might lead those i live amongst to suspect the nature of my pursuits
3575-170457-0024	don't always succeed for sometimes when i'm teaching or sewing i would rather be reading a writing but i tried to deny myself and my father's approbation amply rewarded me for the privation
3575-170457-0025	again i thank you this incident i suppose will be renewed no more if i live to be an old woman i shall remember it thirty years hence as a bright dream
3575-170457-0026	peace pray sir excuse me for writing to you a second time i cannot help writing partly to tell you how thankful i am for your kindness and partly to let you know that your advice shall not be wasted however sorely and reluctantly it may be at first followed see b
3575-170457-0027	i cannot deny myself the gratification of inserting sothy's reply
3575-170457-0028	ceswick marched twenty second eighteen thirty seven dear madame
3575-170457-0029	your letter has given me great pleasure and i should not forgive myself if i did not tell you so
3575-170457-0030	of this second letter also she spoke and told me that it contained an invitation for her to go and see the poet if ever she visited the lakes
3575-170457-0031	on august twenty seventh eighteen thirty seven she writes
3575-170457-0032	come come i'm getting really tired of your absence
3575-170457-0033	saturday afternoon saturday comes around and i can have no hope of hearing your knock at the door and then being told that miss he is come oh dear
3575-170457-0034	in this monotonous life of mine that was a pleasant event
3575-170457-0035	i wish it were recur again but it will take two or three interviews before the stiffness the estrangement of this long separation will wear away
3575-170457-0036	my eyes fill with tears when i contrast the bliss of such a state brightened by hopes of the future with the melancholy state i now living uncertain that i ever felt true contraction wondering in thought and deed
3575-170457-0037	if christian perfection be necessary to salvation i shall never be saved my heart is a very hot bed for sinful thoughts and when i decide on an action i scarcely remember to look to my redeemer for direction
3575-170457-0038	and meantime i know the greatness of javert i acknowledge the perfection of his word i adore the purity of the christian faith my theory is right my practice horribly wrong
3575-170457-0039	the christmas holidays came and she and anne returned to the parsonage and to that happy home circle in which alone their natures espanded amongst all other people they shriveled up more or less
3575-170457-0040	indeed there were only one or two strangers who could be admitted among the sisters without producing the same result
3575-170457-0041	she was gone out into the village on some errand when as she was descending the steep street her foot slipped on the ice and she fell it was dark and no one saw her mistake till after a time her groans attracted the attention of a passer by
3575-170457-0042	unfortunately the faction cannot be set till six o'clock the next morning as no surgeon was to be had before that time and she now lies at our house in a very doubtful and dangerous state
3575-170457-0043	however remembering what you told me namely that you had commanded the matter to a higher decision than ours and that you are resolved to submit with resignation to that decision whatever it might be i hold it my duty to yield also and to be silent and may be all for the best
3575-170457-0044	after this disappointment i never dared reckon with certainty on the enjoyment of a pleasure again it seems as if some fatality stood between you and me
3575-170457-0045	i am not good enough for you and you must be kept from the contamination of two intimate society
3575-170457-0046	a good neighbor of the bartes a clever intelligent yorkshire woman who keeps a drugist shop in hawworth from her occupation her experience and excellent sense holds the position of village doctor
3575-170457-0047	tabby had lived with them for ten or twelve years and was as charlotte expressed it one of the family
3575-170457-0048	he refused at first to listen to the careful advice it was redundant to his liberal nature
3575-170457-0049	this decision was communicated to the girls
3575-170457-0050	tabby had tended them in their childhood they and none other should tend her in her infirmity and age
3575-170457-0051	at tea time they were sad and silent and the meal went away untouched by any of the three
3575-170457-0052	she had another wait on her mind this christmas
3575-170457-0053	but anne had begun to suffer just before the holidays and charlotte watched over her younger sisters with a jealous vigilance of some wild creature that changes her very nature if danger threatens her young
3575-170457-0054	stung by anxiety for this little sister she upset miss debby for her fancied indifference to aunt of health
3575-170457-0055	still her heart had received a shock in the perception of anne's delicacy and all these hardships she watched over her with the longing fond agency which is so full of sudden pang of fear
3575-170457-0056	i doubt whether brannwell was maintaining himself at this time
7127-75947-0000	every one could observe his agitation and prostration a prostitution which was indeed the more remarkable since people were not accustomed to see him with his arms hanging listlessly by his side his head bewildered and his eyes with all their bright intelligence dimmed
7127-75947-0001	upon this madame dained to turn her eyes languishingly toward the comet observing
7127-75947-0002	do you think so she replied with indifference
7127-75947-0003	yes the character which your royal highness assumed is in perfect harmony with your own
7127-75947-0004	explain yourself
7127-75947-0005	elude to the goddess
7127-75947-0006	the princess enquired no
7127-75947-0007	she then rose humming the air to which she was presently going to dance
7127-75947-0008	the arrow pierced his heart and wounded him mortally
7127-75947-0009	a quarter of an hour afterwards he returned to the theatre but it will be readily believed that it was only a powerful effort of reason over his great excitement that enabled him to go back or perhaps for love is thus strangely constituted he found it impossible even to remain much longer separated from the presence of one who had broken his heart
7127-75947-0010	when she perceived the young man she rose like a woman surprised in the midst of ideas she was desirous of concealing from herself
7127-75947-0011	remain i implore you the evening is most lovely
7127-75947-0012	indeed a
7127-75947-0013	i remember now and i congratulate myself do you love any one
7127-75947-0014	give me i hardly know what i am saying a thousand times forgive me madame was right quite right this brutal axe has completely turned my brain
7127-75947-0015	there cannot be a doubt he received you kindly for in fact you returned without his permission
7127-75947-0016	oh mademoiselle why have i not a devoted sister or a true friend such as yourself
7127-75947-0017	what already here they said to her
7127-75947-0018	i have been here this quarter of an hour replied laura
7127-75947-0019	did not the dancing amuse you no
7127-75947-0020	now more than the dancing
7127-75947-0021	lavallier is quite a poet said toni scherent
7127-75947-0022	i am a woman and there are few like me who ever loves me flatters me whoever flatters me pleases me and whoever pleases well said monteclair you do not finish
7127-75947-0023	it is too difficult replied mademoiselle detenant laughing loudly
7127-75947-0024	look yonder do you not see the moon slowly rising silencing the topmost branches of the chestnuts and the oaks
7127-75947-0025	exquisite soft turf of the woods the happiness which your friendship confers upon me
7127-75947-0026	well said mademoiselle de tonacourt i also think a good deal but i take care
7127-75947-0027	to say nothing said monsieur detonier so that when mademoiselle detonier thinks hethnani is the only one who knows it
7127-75947-0028	quick quick then among the high reed grass said monte laire stoop ethanier you are so tall
7127-75947-0029	the young girls had indeed made themselves small indeed invisible
7127-75947-0030	she was here just now said the count
7127-75947-0031	you are positive then
7127-75947-0032	yes but perhaps i frightened her in what way
7127-75947-0033	how is it laurier said mademoiselle de tournier that the vic comte de bragueon spoke of you as louise
7127-75947-0034	it seems the king will not consent to it
7127-75947-0035	good gracious has the king any right to interfere in matters of that kind
7127-75947-0036	i give my consent
7127-75947-0037	oh i am speaking seriously replied monsieur and my opinion in this case is quite as good as the king's i suppose is it not louise
7127-75947-0038	let us run then said all three and gracefully lifting up the long skirts of their silk dresses they lightly ran across the open space between the lake and the thicketed covert of the park
7127-75947-0039	in fact the sound of madams and the queen's carriages could be heard in the distance upon the hard dry ground of the roads followed by the mountain cavaliers
7127-75947-0040	in this way the fet of the whole court was a fet also for the mysterious inhabitants of the forest for certainly the deer in the brake the fenton on the branch the fox in its hole were all listening
7127-75946-0000	at the conclusion of the banquet which was served at five o'clock the king entered his cabinet where his tailors were awaiting him for the purpose of trying on the selected costume representing spring which was the result of so much imagination and had cost so many efforts of thought to the designers and ornament workers of the court
7127-75946-0001	ah very well
7127-75946-0002	let him come in then said the king and as if cole bear had been listening at the door for the purpose of keeping himself ocornant with the conversation he entered as soon as the king had pronounced his name to the two courtiers
7127-75946-0003	gentleman to your posts whereupon saint andon and villefort took their leave
7127-75946-0004	 certainly sire but i must have money to do that what
7127-75946-0005	what do you mean inquired louise
7127-75946-0006	he has given them with too much grace not to have others still to give if they are required which is the case at the present moment
7127-75946-0007	it is necessary therefore that he should comply the king frowned
7127-75946-0008	does your majesty then no longer believe the disloyal attempt
7127-75946-0009	not at all you are on the contrary most agreeable to me
7127-75946-0010	your majesty's plan then in this affair is
7127-75946-0011	you will take them from my private treasure
7127-75946-0012	the news circulated with the rapidity of lightning during its progress it kindled every variety of cockadry desire and wild ambition
7127-75946-0013	the king had completed his toilet by nine o'clock he appeared in an open carriage decorated with branches of trees and flowers
7127-75946-0014	the queens had taken their seats upon a magnificent daus or platform erected upon the borders of the lake in a theatre of wonderful elegance of construction
7127-75946-0015	uddenly for the purpose of restoring peace and order spring accompanied by his whole court made his appearance
7127-75946-0016	the seasons alliances of spring followed him closely to form a quadrile which after many words of more or less flattering import was the commencement of the dance
7127-75946-0017	his legs the best shaped at court were displayed to great advantage in flesh colored silk hose of silk so fine and so transparent that it seemed almost like flesh itself
7127-75946-0018	there was something in his carriage which resembled the buoyant movements of an immortal and he did not dance so much as seemed to soar along
7127-75946-0019	yes it is suppressed
7127-75946-0020	far from it sire your majesty having given no directions about it the musici have retained it
7127-75946-0021	yes sire and ready dressed for the ballet
7127-75946-0022	 sire he said your majesties most devoted servants most devoted servant that he has already shone on the field of battle
7127-75946-0023	the king seemed only pleased with every one present
7127-75946-0024	masere was the only one who did not understand anything about the matter
7127-75946-0025	the balcony began the effect was more than beautiful
7127-75946-0026	when the music by its bursts of melody carried away these illustrious dancers when the simple untutored pantomime of that period only the more natural on account of the very indifferent acting of the august actors had reached its culmination point of triumph the theatre shook with tumultuous applause
7127-75946-0027	detainful of a success of which madame showed no acknowledgment he thought of nothing but boldly regarding the marked preference of the princess
7127-75946-0028	by degrees all his happiness all his brilliancy subsided into regret and uneasiness so that his limbs lost their power his arms hung heavily by his sides and his head drooped as though he were stupified
7127-75946-0029	the king who had from this moment become in reality the principal dancer in the quadrille cast a look upon his vanquished rival
2961-960-0000	he passes abruptly from persons to ideas and numbers to persons from austerity to philosophy he confuses or rather does not distinguish subject and object first and final causes and is dreaming of judicial figures lost in a flux of sense
2961-960-0001	the influence which the tamias has exercised upon posterity is due partly to a misunderstanding
2961-960-0002	in the supposed depths of this dialect the neo platynists found hidden meanings in connections with the jewish and christian scriptures and out of them they elicited doctrines quite at variance with the spirit of platoy
2961-960-0003	they were absorbed in his theology and were under the dominion of his name while that which was truly great and truly correctivist in him his effort to realize and connect abstractions was not understood by them at all
2961-960-0004	there is no danger of the modern combatants on de tamia's falling into the absurdities of the neoplatonists
2961-960-0005	in the present day we are well aware that an eminent philosopher is to be interpreted from himself and by the contemporary history of thought
2961-960-0006	the fancies of the neo platynists are only interesting to us because they exist a phase of the human mind which prevailed widely in the first centuries of the christian era and is not wholly extinct in our own day
2961-960-0007	but they have nothing to do with the interpetition of plato and in spirit they are opposed to him
2961-960-0008	we do not know how plato would have arranged his own dialects or whether the thought of arranging any of them besides the two tragedies which he has extensively connected was ever present to his mind
2961-960-0009	the dialogue is primarily concerned with the annual creation including under this term the heavenly bodies and with man only as one among the animals
2961-960-0010	but he has not as yet defined this eminent territory which lies somewhere between medicine and mathematics and he would have felt that there was as great an impedacy in ranking theories of physics first in the order of knowledge as in placing the body before the sole
2961-960-0011	with heraclitus he acknowledges the perpetual flux like anaxagoras he asserts the predominance of mind although admitting an element of necessity which reason is incapable of subduing like the pythagorians he supposes the mystery of the world to be contained in number
2961-960-0012	many if not all the elements of the prehistoric philosophy are included in the tamis
2961-960-0013	it is probable that the relation of the ideas to god or of god to the world was differently conceived by him at different times of his life
2961-960-0014	the ideas also remain but they have become ties in nature forms of men animals birds fishes
2961-960-0015	the steel and plen of the tamias differ greatly from that of any other of the platonic dolphins
2961-960-0016	but plato has not the same mastery over his instrument which he exhibits in the feasts or symposia
2961-960-0017	nothing can exceed the beauty or art of the introduction in which his using words after his accustomed manner
2961-960-0018	but in the rest of the work the power of language seems to fail him and the dramatic form is wholly given up
2961-960-0019	he could write in one style but not in another and the greek language had not as yet been fashioned by any poet or philosopher to describe physical phenomena
2961-960-0020	and hence we find the same sort of clumsiness in the tamias of platy which characterizes the philosophical poem of lecras
2961-960-0021	there is a want of flow and often a defect of rhythm the meaning is sometimes obscure and there is a greater use of apostrophe and more of repetition than occurs in platitudes earlier writings
2961-960-0022	plato had not the command of his materials which would have enabled him to produce a perfect work of art
2961-961-0000	psychopathies begins the tymiades with a sumery of the republic
2961-961-0001	and now he desires to see the ideal state set in motion he would like to know how she behaved in some great struggle
2961-961-0002	and therefore to you i turned timius citizen of laucris who are at once a philosopher and a statesman and to you critias whom all Athenians know to be similarly accomplished and to hermocrates who also fitted by nature and education to share in our discourse
2961-961-0003	i will if timias approves i approve
2961-961-0004	listen then sorotras to a tale of solon's who being the friend of droppidas my great grandfather told it to my grandfather critias and he told me
2961-961-0005	some poems of sullen were recited by the boys
2961-961-0006	and what was the subject of the poem said the person who made the remark
2961-961-0007	the subject was a very noble one it described the most famous action in which the italian people were ever engaged
2961-961-0008	but the memory of their exploits had passed away owing to the lapse of time and the extinction of the electors
2961-961-0009	tell us said the other the whole story and where sullen heard the story
2961-961-0010	but in egypt the traditions of our own and other lands are by us registered forever in our temples
2961-961-0011	the genialities which you have recited to us out of your own angel solo are a mere children's story
2961-961-0012	for in the times before the great flood athina was the greatest and best of cities and did the noble deeds and had the best constitution of any under the face of heaven
2961-961-0013	solid marveled and desired to be informed of the particulars
2961-961-0014	nine thousand years have elapsed since she founded yours and eight thousand since she founded ours as our annals recorded
2961-961-0015	many laws exist among us which are the counterpart of yours as they were in the olden time
2961-961-0016	i will briefly describe them to you and you shall read the account of them at your leisure in the sacred registers
2961-961-0017	observe again what care the lot took in the pursuit of wisdom searching out the deep things of the world and applying them to the use of men
2961-961-0018	the most famous of them all was the overview of the island of atlantis
2961-961-0019	for at the peril of her own existence and when the other hellens had deserted her she repelled the invader and her own accord gave liberty to all the nations within the pillars
2961-961-0020	this is the explanation of the shallows which are found in that part of the atlantic ocean
2961-961-0021	but i would not speak at the time because i wanted to refresh my memory
2961-961-0022	then now let me explain to you the order of our entertainment first timaeus who is a natural philosopher will speak of the men whom he has created and some of whom will have been educated by you and introduce them to you as the lost Athenian citizens of whom the edition records spoke
8463-287645-0000	this was what did the mischief so far as the running away was concerned
8463-287645-0001	it is hardly necessary to say more of them here
8463-287645-0002	from the manner in which he expressed himself with regard to robert hollon no man in the whole range of his recollections will be longer remembered than he his entombment while under holland will hardly ever be forgotten
8463-287645-0003	of this party edward wandered a boy of seventeen called forth much sympathy he too was claimed by holland
8463-287645-0004	john wesley combash jacob taylor and thomas edward skinner
8463-287645-0005	a few years back one of their slaves a coachman was kept on the coach box one cold night when they were out at a ball until he became almost frozen to death and fact he did die in the infirmary from the effects of the frost about one week afterwards
8463-287645-0006	the doctor who attended the injured creature in this case was simply told that she slipped and fell down the stairs as she was coming down
8463-287645-0007	another case said john wesley was a little girl half grown who was washing windows upstairs one day and luckily fell asleep in the window and in this position was found by her mistress in a two hours from the affections thereof
8463-287645-0008	as usual nothing was done in the way of punishment
8463-287645-0009	and never knew of but one man who could ever please him
8463-287645-0010	he wrapped me very hard he wanted to be beating me all the time
8463-287645-0011	she was a large homely woman they were common white people with no reputation in the community
8463-287645-0012	substantially this was jakob's unvarnished description of his master and mistress
8463-287645-0013	as to his age and also the name of his master jakob's statement varied somewhat from the advertisement
8463-287645-0014	of starting i didn't know the way to come
8463-294825-0000	it's almost beyond conjecture
8463-294825-0001	this rarity begins to explain the dark power and other worldly fascination of twenty thousand leagues under the seas
8463-294825-0002	first as a paradise stockbroker later as a celebrated author and yachtsmen he went on frequent voyages to britain america the mediterranean
8463-294825-0003	neo builds a fabulous futuristic submarine the nautilus then conducts an underwater campaign of vengeance against his imperialist opponent
8463-294825-0004	in all the novel had a difficult justation
8463-294825-0005	other suitsures occur inside each episode the textures sparkling with wit information and insight
8463-294825-0006	his specifications for an open sea submarine and a self containing diving suit were decks before their time yet modern technology bears them out triumphantly
8463-294825-0007	even the supporting cast is shrewdly drawn professor aronnax the career scientist who catches in an ethical conflict conseil the conservative ned land a creature of constant appetites man as heroic animal
8463-294825-0008	but much of the novel's brooding power comes from captain nemo
8463-294825-0009	this compulsion leads nemo into ugly contradictions he is a fighter for freedom yet all who boarded his ship are imprisoned there for good he works to save lives both human and animal yet he himself creates a hallucosis he detests imperialism yet he lays personal claim to the south pole
8463-294825-0010	and in this last action he falls into the classic sin of pride
8463-294825-0011	he is swiftly punished
8463-294825-0012	the nautilus nearly parishes in the antarctic and nemo sinks into a growing depression
8463-294825-0013	for many then this book has been a source of fascination surely one of the most influential novels ever written and inspiration for such scientists and discoverers as engineer simon lake astronomer william beckett polar traveler sir ennis shackleton
8463-294825-0014	father's six feet

8463-294828-0002	even so i had just returned from an arduous journey exhausted and badly needing a rest
8463-294828-0003	i wanted nothing more than to see my country again my friends my modest quarters by the botanical gardens my dearly beloved colonies
8463-294828-0004	but now nothing could hold me back
8463-294828-0005	cosette was my man servant
8463-294828-0006	from rubbing shoulders with scientists in our little universe by the botanical gardens the boy had come to know a thing or two
8463-294828-0007	clasifying was everything to him so he knew nothing else well versed in the theory of classification he was poorly versed in its practical application and i doubt that he could tell a sperm whale from a baleen whale
8463-294828-0008	and yet what a fine gallant lad
8463-294828-0009	not once did he comment on the length or the hardness of the journey
8463-294828-0010	never did he object to buckling up his suit case for any country whatever china or the congo no matter how far off it was
8463-294828-0011	he went here there and everywhere in perfect contentment
8463-294828-0012	please forgive me for this unwanted way of admitting that i had turned forty
8463-294828-0013	he was a fanatic on formality and he only addressed me in the third person to the point where it got hilarious
8463-294828-0014	there was good reason to stop and think even for the world's most emotionless man
8463-294828-0015	conseil i called a third time conseil appeared
8463-294828-0016	did master summon me he said entering
8463-294828-0017	pack as much into my trunk as you can my traveling kit my suits shirts and socks don't bother counting just squeeze it all in and hurry
8463-294828-0018	we'll deal with them later what
8463-294828-0019	anyhow we'll leave instructions to ship the whole merchandise to france
8463-294828-0020	yes we are certainly i replied evasively but after we make a detour
8463-294828-0021	awake slightly less direct that's all
8463-294828-0022	were leaving on the abraham lincoln
8463-294828-0023	you see my friend it's an issue of the monster the notorious narwhale
8463-294828-0024	we don't know where it will take us
8463-294828-0025	but were going just the same
8463-294828-0026	we have a commander whose game for anything
8463-294828-0027	i left instructions for shipping my containers of stuffed animals and dried plants to paris france
8463-294828-0028	i opened a line of credit sufficient to cover the barbaresca and conseil at my heels i jumped into a carriage
8463-294828-0029	our baggage was immediately carried to the deck of the frigate i rushed aboard
8463-294828-0030	i asked for commander ferragut
8463-294828-0031	one of the sailors led me to the aft deck where i stood in the presence of a smart looking officer who extended his hand to me
8463-294828-0032	in person welcome a boarder your cabin is waiting for you
8463-294828-0033	was well satisfied with my cabin which was located in the stern and opened into the officer's mess
8463-294828-0034	we'll be quite comfortable here i told conseil
8463-294828-0035	and so if i had been delayed by a quarter of an hour or even less the frigate would have gone without me and i would have missed out on this unearthly extraordinary and inconceivable expedition whose true story might well meet with some scepticism
8463-294828-0036	the wars of brooklyn and every part of new york bordering the east river were crowded with curiosity seekers
8463-294828-0037	departing from five hundred thousand throats three cheers burst forth in succession
8463-294828-0038	thousands of handkerchiefs were waving above these tightly packed masses hauling the abraham lincoln until it reached the waters of the hudson river at the tip of the long peninsula that forms new york city
8230-279154-0000	the analysis of knowledge will occupy us until the end of the thirteenth lecture and is the most difficult part of our whole enterprise
8230-279154-0001	what is called perception differs from sensation by the fact that the sensation indigenous bring up habitual associations images and expectations of their usual correlates all of which are objectively indistinguishable from the sensation
8230-279154-0002	whether or not this principle is liable to exceptions every one would agree that it has a broad measure of truth though the word exactly might seem an overstatement and it might seem more correct to say that ideas ostensibly represent impressions
8230-279154-0003	and what sort of evidence is logically possible
8230-279154-0004	there is no logical impossibility in the hypothesis that the world sprang into being five minutes ago exactly as it then was with a population that remembered a wholly unreal past
8230-279154-0005	all that i am doing is to use its logical tenability as a help in the analysis of what occurs when we remember
8230-279154-0006	theaviorist who attempts to make science a record of behavior has to trust his memory in making the record
8230-279154-0007	habit is a consequence involving the occurrence of similar events at different times if the behaviorist fills confident that there is such a phenomenon as habit that can only be because he trusts his memory when it assures him that there have been other times
8230-279154-0008	but i do not think such an interference is warranted
8230-279154-0009	our confidence or lack of confidence in the accuracy of a memory image must industrial cases be based upon a characteristic of the image itself since we cannot evoke the past bodily and compare it with the present image
8230-279154-0010	we sometimes have images that are by no means personally vague which yet we do not trust for example under the influence of fatigue we may see a friend's face visibly and clearly but horribly distorted
8230-279154-0011	some images like some sensations fill very familiar while others feel strange
8230-279154-0012	facility is a feeling capable of degrees
8230-279154-0013	in an image of a well known face for example some parts may feel more familiar than others when this happens we have more belief in the accuracy of the familiar parts than in that of the unfamiliar parts
8230-279154-0014	i come now to the other characteristic which memory images must have in order to account for our knowledge of the past
8230-279154-0015	they must have some characteristic which makes us regard them as referring to more or less remote portions of the past
8230-279154-0016	in actual fact there are doubtless various factors that concern in giving us the feeling of greater or less remoteness in some remembered event
8230-279154-0017	there may be a specific filling which could be called the filling of pastness especially where immediate memory is concerned
8230-279154-0018	there is of course a difference between knowing the temporal relation of a remembered event to the present and knowing the time order of two remembered events
8230-279154-0019	it would seem that only rather recent events can be placed at all accurately by means of feelings giving their temporal relation to the present but it is clear that such feelings must play an essential part in the process of dating remembered events
8230-279154-0020	if we had retained the subject or act in knowledge the whole problem of memory would have been comparatively simple
8230-279154-0021	remembering has to be a present occurrence in some way resembling or related to what is remembered
8230-279154-0022	some points may be taken as fixed and such as any theory of memory must arise at
8230-279154-0023	in this case as in most others what may be taken as certain in advance is rather vague
8230-279154-0024	the first of our vague but indubitable date is that there is knowledge of the past
8230-279154-0025	we might provisionally though perhaps not quite correctly define memory as that of knowing about the past which has no analogy in our knowledge of the future such a definition would at least serve to mark the problem with which we are concerned though some explications may deserve to rank with memory as regards immediacy
8230-279154-0026	this distinction is vital to the understanding of memory but it is not so easy to carry out in practice as it is to draw in theory
8230-279154-0027	a gramine by the help of suitable records might relate to us the incidents of its past and people are not so different from grammonts as they like to believe
8230-279154-0028	i can set to work now to remember things i never remembered before such as what i had to eat for breakfast this morning and it can hardly be wholly habit that enables me to do this
8230-279154-0029	the fact that a man can recite a poem does not show that he remembers any previous occasion on which he has recited or read it
8230-279154-0030	simon's two books mentioned in an earlier lecture do not touch knowledge memory at all closely
8230-279154-0031	they give laws according to which images of past occasions come into our minds but do not discuss our beliefs that these images refer to past occurrences which is what constitutes knowledge memory
8230-279154-0032	it is this that is of interest to theory of knowledge
8230-279154-0033	it is by no means always reliable almost everybody has at some time experienced the unknown illusion that all that is happening now happened before at some time
8230-279154-0034	whenever the sense of familiarity occurs without a definite object it leads us to search the environment until we are satisfied that we have found the appropriate object which leads us to the judgment this is familiar
8230-279154-0035	thus no knowledge as to the past is to be derived from the feeling of familiarity alone
8230-279154-0036	another stage is recognition
8230-279154-0037	regnation in this sense does not necessarily involve more than a habit of association the kind of object we are seeing at the moment is associated with the word cat or with an automatic image of purring or whatever other characteristic we may happen to recognize in the cat of the moment
8230-279154-0038	we are of course in fact able to judge when we recognize an object that we have seen it before but this judgment is something over and above recognition in this first sense and may very probably be impossible to animals that nevertheless have the experience of recognition in this first sense of the word
8230-279154-0039	this knowledge is memory in one sense though in another it is not
8230-279154-0040	there are however several points in which such an account of registration is inadequate to begin with it might seem at first sight more correct to define recognition as i have seen this before than as this has existed before
8230-279154-0041	the definition of my experience is difficult broadly speaking it is everything that is connected with what i am experiencing now by certain links of which the various forms of memory are among the most important
8230-279154-0042	thus if i recognize a thing the occasion of its previous existence in virtue of which i recognize it forms part of my experience by definition recognition will be one of the marks by which my experience is singled out from the rest of the world
8230-279154-0043	of course the words this has existed before are a very inadequate translation of what actually happens when we form a judgment of recognition but that is unavoidable words are framed to express a level of thought which is by no means primitive and are quite incapable of expressing such an elementary occurrence as recognition
7176-92135-0000	he is a welcome figure at the garden parties of the elite who are always ready to encourage him by accepting free seats for his play actor managers nod to him editors allow him to contribute without charge to a composition on the price of golf balls
7176-92135-0001	in short he becomes a prominent figure in london society and if he is not careful somebody will say so
7176-92135-0002	but even the unsuccessful diplomat has his moments
7176-92135-0003	you're play must be not merely a good play but a successful one
7176-92135-0004	frankly i cannot always say
7176-92135-0005	but suppose you said i'm fond of writing my people always say my letters home or good enough for punch
7176-92135-0006	i've got a little idea for a play about a man and a woman and another woman and perhaps i'd better keep the plot a secret for the moment
7176-92135-0007	anyhow it's jolly exciting and i can do the dialogue all right
7176-92135-0008	listen me your ear for ten minutes and you shall learn just what stage craft is
7176-92135-0009	and i should begin with a short homely on sexuality
7176-92135-0010	ham too be or not to be
7176-92135-0011	now the object of this solitude is plain
7176-92135-0012	indeed isolation being the keenest of hamlet's solitude a clever player could to some extent indicate the whole thirty lines by a silent working of the jaw but at the same time it would be idle to deny that he would miss the finer shades of the dramatic meaning
7176-92135-0013	we moderns however see the absurdity of it
7176-92135-0014	if it be granted first that the thoughts of a certain character should be known to the audience and secondly that sociology or the habit of thinking aloud is in opposition to modern stage technique how shall a sociology be avoided without damage to the play
7176-92135-0015	and so on till you get to the end when ophelia might say ah yes or something noncommittal of that sort
7176-92135-0016	this would be an easy way of doing it but it would not be the best way for the reason that it is too easy to call attention to itself
7176-92135-0017	and the old badly made play it was frequently necessary for one of the characters to take the audience into his confidence
7176-92135-0018	in the modern well constructed play he simply rings up an imaginary conference and tells them what he is going to do could anything be more natural
7176-92135-0019	i want double nine hullo
7176-92135-0020	double nine two three elsonor double not yes hello is that euralia hamilton speaking
7176-92135-0021	i say i've been wondering about this business
7176-92135-0022	do be or not to be that is the question whether it is nobler in the mind to suffer the springs and arrows what no hamlet speaking
7176-92135-0023	you gave me double five i want double nine hello is that you horatio hamlet speaking
7176-92135-0024	do be or not to be that is the question whether tis nobler
7176-92135-0025	it is to let hamlet if that happened to be the name of your character enter with a small dog pet falcon monaco tame bear or whatever animal is most in keeping with the part and confined in this animal such sorrows hopes or secret history as the audience has got to know
7176-92135-0026	enter hamlet with his favorite borchond
7176-92135-0027	lady larkspur started suddenly and turns toward him
7176-92135-0028	larque bit me again this morning for the third time
7176-92135-0029	i want to get away from it all swoon
7176-92135-0030	enter lord arthur fluffin's
7176-92135-0031	and there you are you will of course appreciate that the unfinished sentences not only save time but also make the maneuvering very much more natural
7176-92135-0032	how you may be wondering are you to begin your masterpiece
7176-92135-0033	relapses into silence for the rest of the evening
7176-92135-0034	the dresses of southbridge two lord reggies oh reggie what did you say
7176-92135-0035	then lord tuppenny will what about auction
7176-92135-0036	the crowd drifts off leaving the hero and heroine alone in the middle of the stage and then you can begin
7176-92135-0037	then is the time to introduce a mile on the stage
7176-92135-0038	a stage is popular because it proves to the audience at the actors even when called charles holtro or owin nears real people just like you and me
7176-92135-0039	teach matthews butler impassibly
7176-92135-0040	hostess replace those limp and inclines empty tea pot over tray for a moment then hands me cup painted brown inside thus deceiving the gentleman with the telescope in the upper circle
7176-92135-0041	reynor butler and three footmen who removed the tea things hostess too guest
7176-92135-0042	in novels the hero has often pushed his meals away untasted but no steed hero would do anything so unnatural as this
7176-92135-0043	two bits are made and the bread is crumbled with an air of great eagerness indeed one feels that in real life the guest would clutch hold of the food and say half a mow old chap i have it nearly finished but the actor is better suited than this
7176-92135-0044	but it is the cigarette which chiefly has brought the modern drama to its present state of perfection
7176-92135-0045	lawdon taking out gold cigarette case from his left hand upper waistcoat pocket
7176-88083-0000	all about him was a tumult of bright and broken color scattered in broad splashes
7176-88083-0001	the marguerite had a crest of eroded green back a broad collar of lustrous white black and white wings white belly sides finely penciled in black and white and a breast of rich chestnut red streaked with black
7176-88083-0002	his feet were red his long narrow beak with its saw toothed edges and sharp hooked tip was bright red
7176-88083-0003	but here he was at a terrible disadvantage as compared with the owls hawks and eagles he had no rending claws
7176-88083-0004	but suddenly straight and swift as a diving cormant he shot down into the torrent and disappeared beneath the surface
7176-88083-0005	once fairly a wing however he wheeled and made back hurriedly for his perch
7176-88083-0006	it might have seemed that a trout of this size was a fairly substantial meal
7176-88083-0007	but such was his keenness that even while the wide flecks of his engorged vision were still sticking out at the corners of his beak his fierce red eyes were once more peering downward into the torrent in search of fresh prey
7176-88083-0008	in despair he hurled himself downward too soon
7176-88083-0009	the great hawk folded hurriedly to retrieve his prey from the ground
7176-88083-0010	the cat growled softly picked up the prize in her jaws and trotted into the bushes to devour it
7176-88083-0011	in fact he had just finished it the last of the trout's tail had just vanished with a spasm down his strained gullet when the baffled hock caught sight of him and swooped
7176-88083-0012	the hawk alighted on the dead branch and sat upright motionless as if surprised
7176-88083-0013	like his unfortunate little cousin the teel he too had felt the fear of death smitten into his heart and was heading desperately for the refuge of some dark overhanging bank deep fringed with weeds where the dreadful eye of the hawk should not discern him
7176-88083-0014	the hawk sat upon the branch and watched his quarry swimming beneath the surface
7176-88083-0015	almost instantly he was forced to the top
7176-88083-0016	straightway the hawk glided from his perch and darted after him
7176-88083-0017	but at this point in the rapids it was impossible for him to stay down
7176-88083-0018	but this fragment of the heights of air for all his savage valley was troubled at the leaping waves and the tossing foam of these mad rapids he did not understand them
7176-88083-0019	as he flew his downreaching clutching talons were not half a yard about the fugitive's head
7176-88083-0020	where the waves for an instant sank they came closer but not quite within grasping reach
7176-88083-0021	but as before the leaping waves of the rapids were too much for his pursuer and he was able to flap his way onward in a cloud of foam while doom hung low above his head yet hesitated to strike
7176-88083-0022	the hawk embittered by the loss of his first quarry had become as dogged in pursuit as a wheasel not to be shaken off or evaded or deceived
7176-88083-0023	he had a lot of line out and the place was none too free for a long cast but he was impatient to drop his flies again on the spot where the big fish was feeding
7176-88083-0024	the last dropfly as luck would have it caught just in the corner of the hawks angrily open beak hooking itself firmly
7176-88083-0025	at the sudden sharp sting of it the great bird turned his head and noticed for the first time the fishermen standing on the bank
7176-88083-0026	the drag upon his neck and the light check upon his wings were inexplicable to him and appalling
7176-88083-0027	then the leader parted from the line
1995-1836-0000	the honorable charles smith miss sarah's brother was walking swiftly uptown from mister easterly's walnut office and his face was pale
1995-1836-0001	at last the cotton combine was to all appearances assured fact and he was sated for the senate
1995-1836-0002	why should he not be as other men
1995-1836-0003	she was not herself a notably intelligent woman she greatly admired intelligence or whatever looked to her like intelligence in others
1995-1836-0004	as she awaited her guess she surveyed the table with both satisfaction and dismay for her social functions were few to night there were she checked them off on her fingers sir james christopher the rich englishman a unionist from new jersey a selection of guests that had been determined unknown to the hostess by the meeting of cotton interests earlier in the day
1995-1836-0005	missus gray had met sisters before but not intimately and she always had in mind vividly their cruelty to poor negroes a subject she made a point of introducing forthwith
1995-1836-0006	she was therefore more agreeably surprised to hear mister cresswell express himself so cordially as approving of negro education
1995-1836-0007	do you believe in some agitation asked mary taylor
1995-1836-0008	i believe in the training of people to their highest capacity the english here heartily seconded him
1995-1836-0009	but creswell added significantly capitalism differs enormously between races
1995-1836-0010	the vandemoors were sure of this and the english answering india became quite eloquent missus gray was mystified but hardly dared admit it the general trend of the conversation seemed to be that most individuals to them
1995-1836-0011	positively heroic added creswell avoiding his sister's eyes
1995-1836-0012	but we're not a and exactly welcome
1995-1836-0013	mary taylor however related the tale of zora to missus gray's private ear later
1995-1836-0014	fortunately said mister vanderpool northerly and southerners are arriving at a better mutual understanding on most of these matters
1995-1826-0000	in the debate between the senior societies her defence of the fifteenth amendment had been not only a notable bit of reasoning but delivered with real enthusiasm

1995-1826-0002	john taylor who had supported her through college was interested in cotton
1995-1826-0003	better go he had counseled succinctly
1995-1826-0004	might learn something useful down there
1995-1826-0005	but john there's no society just elementary work

1995-1826-0008	some others too big cotton count
1995-1826-0009	you ought to know john if i teach negroes i'll scarcely see much of people in my own class
1995-1826-0010	at any rate i say go
1995-1826-0011	here she was teaching dirty children and the smell of confused officers and the smell of confused officers and the smell of confused officers and the smell of confused officers and the smell of confused officers and the smell of confused officers and the smell of confused officers and the smell of confused officers and the smell of confused officers and the smell of confused officers and the smell of confused officers and the smell of confused officers and the smell of confused officers and the smell of confused officers and the smell of confused officers and the smell of confused officers and the smell of confused officers and the smell of confused officers and the smell of confused officers and the smell of confused officers and the smell of confused officers and the smell of confused officers and the smell of confused officers and the smell of confused officers and the smell of confused officers and the smell of confused officers and the smell of confused officers and the smell of confused officers and the smell of confused officers and the smell of confused officers and the smell of confused officers and the smell of confused officers and the

1995-1826-0013	so for the hundredth time she was thinking to day as she walked alone up the lane back of the barn and then slowly down through the bottoms
1995-1826-0014	caught she paused
1995-1826-0015	she had almost forgotten that it was here within touch and sight
1995-1826-0016	the glimmering sea of delicate leaves whispered and murmured before her stretching away to the northward
1995-1826-0017	there might be a bit of poetry here and there but most of this place was such desperate prose
1995-1826-0018	her regard shifted to the green stalks and leaves again and she started to move away
1995-1826-0019	cowton is a wonderful thing isn't it not boys she said rather primly
1995-1826-0020	miss taylor did not know much about cotton but at least one more remarked seemed called for
1995-1826-0021	don't know we'll of all things inadvertently burned and caught and oh well as much as to ask what's the use she turned again to go
1995-1826-0022	i suppose though it's too early for them then came the explosion
1995-1826-0023	goobles don't grow on the tops of vines but on the ground on the roots like yams is that so

1995-1826-0025	sometimes you tell me please won't you
1995-1826-0026	now for a one little half hour she had been a woman talking to a boy no not even that she had been talking just talking there were no persons in the conversation just things one thing cotton
1995-1837-0000	he knew the silver fleece his and soras must be ruined
1995-1837-0001	it was the first great sorrow of his life it was not so much the loss of the cotton itself but the famine the hopes the dreams built around it
1995-1837-0002	ah the swamp the cruel swamp
1995-1837-0003	the revelation of his love lighted and brightened slowly till it flamed like a sunrise over him and left him in burning wonder
1995-1837-0004	he panted to know if she too knew or knew and cared not or cared and knew not
1995-1837-0005	she was so strange and human a creature
1995-1837-0006	the world was watered in mists
1995-1837-0007	then of a sudden at midday the sun shot out hot and still no breath of air stirred the sky was like blue steel the earth steamed
1995-1837-0008	where was the use of ammunition
1995-1837-0009	the lagoon had been levelled with the dice a week ago and now
1995-1837-0010	perhaps she too might be there waiting weeping
1995-1837-0011	he started at the thought he hurried forth sadly
1995-1837-0012	he splashed and stamped along farther and farther onward until he neered the rampart of the clearing and put foot upon the tree bridge
1995-1837-0013	then he looked down the lagoon was dry
1995-1837-0014	he stood a moment bewildered then turned and rushed upon the island a great sheet of dazzling sunlight swept the place and beneath lay a tiny mass of olive green thick tall wet and willowy
1995-1837-0015	the squares of cotton sharp edged heavy were just about to burst to bolts
1995-1837-0016	for one long moment he paused stupidly agape with utter amazement then leaned dizzily against the tree
1995-1837-0017	he gazed about perplexed astonished
1995-1837-0018	here lay the reading of the riddle with infinite work and pain some one had dug a canal from the laguna to the creek into which the former had drained by a long and crooked way thus allowing it to empty directly
1995-1837-0019	he sat down weak bewildered and one thought was uppermost sorah
1995-1837-0020	the years of the days of her dying were ten
1995-1837-0021	the hope and dream of harvest was upon the land
1995-1837-0022	up in the sick room sorra lay on the little white bed
1995-1837-0023	the net and web of endless things had been crawling and creeping around her she had struggled in dumb speechless terror against some mighty grasping that strove for her life with gnarled and creeping fingers but now at last weakly she opened her eyes and questioned
1995-1837-0024	for a while she lay in her chair in happy dreamy pleasure at sun and bird and tree
1995-1837-0025	she rose with a fleeting glance gathered the shawl around her then gliding forward wavering tremulously slipped across the road and into the swamp
1995-1837-0026	she had been born within its borders within its borders she had lived and grown and with in its borders she had met her love
1995-1837-0027	on she hurried until sweeping down to the lounge and the island low the cotton lay before her
1995-1837-0028	the chair was empty but he knew
1995-1837-0029	he darted through the trees and paused a tall man strongly but slimly made
1284-1181-0000	oz examined this curious contrivance with wonder
1284-1181-0001	 margaret had first made the girl's form from the patchwork quilt and then she had dressed it with a patchwork skirt and an apron with pockets in it using the same gay material throughout
1284-1181-0002	the head of the patchwork girl was the most curious part of her
1284-1181-0003	the hair was of brown yarn and hung down on her neck in several neat braids
1284-1181-0004	gold is the most common metal in the land of os and is used for many purposes because it is soft and pliable
1284-1181-0005	now i forgot all about the brains exclaimed the woman
1284-1181-0006	well that may be true agreed margolot but on the contrary a servant with too much brains is sure to become independent and high and mighty and feel above her work
1284-1181-0007	she poured into the dish a quantity from each of these bottles
1284-1181-0008	i think that will do she continued for the other qualities are not needed in a servant
1284-1181-0009	she ran to her husband's side at once and helped him lift the four cedils from the fire
1284-1181-0010	their contents had all boiled away leaving in the bottom of each kettle a few grains of fine white powder
1284-1181-0011	very carefully the magician removed this powder placing it altogether in a golden dish where he mixed it with a golden spoon
1284-1181-0012	one saw him do this for all were looking at the powder of life but soon the woman remembered what she had been doing and came back to the cupboard
1284-1181-0013	oz became a bit uneasy at this for he had already put quite a lot of the cleverness powder in the dish but he dared not interfere and so he comforted himself with the thought that one cannot have too much cleverness
1284-1181-0014	he selected a small gold bottle with a pepper box top so that the powder might be sprinkled on any object through the small holes
1284-1181-0015	most people talk too much so it is a relief to find one who talks too little
1284-1181-0016	i am not allowed to perform magic except for my own amusement he told his visitors as he lighted a pipe with a crooked stem and began to smoke
1284-1181-0017	the wizard of ours who used to be a humbug and knew no magic at all has been taking lessons of glind and i'm told he is getting to be a pretty good wizard but he is merely the assistant of the great sorcerer
1284-1181-0018	it truly is asserted the magician
1284-1181-0019	now use them as a permanent substitute in my garden
1284-1181-0020	dear me what a chatter box you're getting to be ank remarked the magician who was pleased with the compliment
1284-1181-0021	asked the voice in scornful accents
1284-1180-0000	he wore blue silk stockings blue knee pants with gold buckles a blue ruffled waist and a jacket of bright blue braided with gold
1284-1180-0001	his hat had a peaked crown at a flat brim and around the brim was a row of tiny golden bells that tinkled when he moved
1284-1180-0002	instead of shoes the old man wore boots with torn outer tops and his blue coat had wide cuffs of gold braid
1284-1180-0003	for a long time he had wished to explore the beautiful land of as in which they lived
1284-1180-0004	when they were outside unkempt the door and started up the path
1284-1180-0005	now one would disturb their little house even if any one came so far into the thick forest while they were gone
1284-1180-0006	at the foot of the mountain that separated the country of the monchins from the country of the gilokuns the path divided
1284-1180-0007	he knew it would take them to the house of the crooked magician whom he had never seen but who was their nearest neighbor
1284-1180-0008	all the morning they trudged up the mountain path and at noon unk and ojo sat on a fallen tree trunk and ate the last of the bread which the old monk had placed in his pocket
1284-1180-0009	then they started on again and two hours later came in sight of the house of doctor pipett
1284-1180-0010	unc knocked at the door of the house and a chubby pleasant faced woman dressed all in blue opened it and greeted the visitors with a smile
1284-1180-0011	i am my dear and all strangers are welcome to my home
1284-1180-0012	we have come from a far lonelier place than this a lonelier place
1284-1180-0013	and you must be o joe the unlucky she added
1284-1180-0014	ojoe had never eaten such a fine meal in all his life
1284-1180-0015	we're traveling replied o joe and we stopped at your house just to rest and refresh ourselves
1284-1180-0016	the woman seemed thoughtful
1284-1180-0017	at one end stood a great fireplace in which a blue log was blazing with a blue flame and over the fire hung four kettles in a row all bubbling and steaming at a great rate
1284-1180-0018	it takes me several years to make this magic powder but at this moment i am pleased to say it is nearly done you see i am making it for my good wife margaret lott who wants to use some of it for a purpose of her own
1284-1180-0019	you must know said margaloct when they were all seated together on the broad window seat that my husband foolishly gave away all the powder of life he first made to old mombi the witch who used to live in the country of the giligans to the north of here
1284-1180-0020	the first lot we tested on our glass cat which not only began to live but has lived ever since
1284-1180-0021	i think the next glass cat the magician makes will have neither brains nor heart for then it will not object to catching mice and may prove of some use to us
1284-1180-0022	im afraid i don't know much about the land of ours
1284-1180-0023	you see i've lived all my life with uncleunky the silent one and there was no one to tell me anything
1284-1180-0024	that is one reason you are ojo the unlucky said the woman in a sympathetic tone
1284-1180-0025	i think i must show you my patchwork girl said margaret laughing at the boys astonishment for she is rather difficult to explain
1284-1180-0026	but first i will tell you that for many years i have longed for a servant to help me with the household and to cook the meals and wash the dishes
1284-1180-0027	yet that task was not so easy as you may suppose
1284-1180-0028	a bed quilt made of patches of different kinds and colors of cloth all neatly sewed together
1284-1180-0029	sometimes it is called a crazy quilt because the patches and colors are so mixed up
1284-1180-0030	when i found it i said to myself that it would do nicely for my servant girl for when she was brought to life she would not be proud nor haughty as the glass cat is for such a dreadful mixture of colors would discourage her from trying to be as dignified as the blue monkkins are
1284-1180-0031	at the emerald city where our princess osma lives green is the popular color
1284-1180-0032	i will show you what a good job i did and she went to a tall cupboard and threw open the doors
1284-134647-0000	the grateful applause of the clergy has consecrated the memory of a prince who indulged their passions and promoted their interests
1284-134647-0001	the edict of malan the great charger of tolerance had confirmed to each individual of the roman world the privilege of choosing and professing his own religion
1284-134647-0002	but this enigmatical privilege was soon violated with the knowledge of truth the emperor embided the maxims of persecution and the sects which descended from the catholic church were afflicted and oppressed by the triumph of christianity
1284-134647-0003	constante easily believed that the hermits who presumed to dispute his opinions or to oppose his commands were guilty of the most absurd and criminal obstinacy and that a sensible application of moderate severities might save those unhappy men from the danger of an everlasting condemnation
1284-134647-0004	some of the penal regulations were copied from the edicts of diocletion and this method of conversion were obeyed by the same bishops who had felt the hand of oppression and pleaded for the rights of humanity
1284-134647-0005	they asserted with confidence and almost with exaltation that the apostolic succession was interrupted that all the bishops of europe and asia were infected to the chosen portion of the african believers who alone had preserved inviolate the integrity of their faith and discipline
1284-134647-0006	bishop virgins and even spotless infants were subjected to the disgrace of a public penance before they could be admitted to the communion of the dominants
1284-134647-0007	prescribed by the civil and ecclesiastical powers of the empire the donatist still maintained in some provinces particularly in nimidia their superior numbers and four hundred bishops acknowledged the jurisdiction of their primeate
5142-36377-0000	it was one of the masterly and charming stories of damon the elder
5142-36377-0001	in five minutes i was in a new world and my melancholy room was full of the liveliest french company
5142-36377-0002	the sound of an imperative and uncompromising bell recalled me in due time to the regions of reality
5142-36377-0003	ambrose met me the bottom of the stairs and showed me the way to the supper room
5142-36377-0004	she signed to me with a ghostly solemnity to take the vacant place on the left of her father
5142-36377-0005	the door opened again while i was still studying the two brothers without i honestly confessed being very favorably impressed by either of them
5142-36377-0006	an new member of the family circle who instantly attracted my attention entered the room
5142-36377-0007	another crack that in the popular phrase was my impression of the stranger who now made his appearance in the supper room
5142-36377-0008	mr meadowcroft the elder having not spoken one word thus far himself introduced the new comer to me with a side glance at his sons which had something like defiance in it a glance which as i was sorry to notice was returned with a defiance on their side by the two young men
5142-36377-0009	philip blaffer frank this is my overlooker mister yorke said the old man formally presenting us
5142-36377-0010	he is not well he has come over the ocean for rest and changes scene
5142-36377-0011	monter jago is an american philip
5142-36377-0012	make acquaintance with mister yago sit together
5142-36377-0013	they pointedly drew back from john yorke as he approached the empty chair next to me and moved round to the opposite side of the table
5142-36377-0014	a pretty girl and so far as i could judge by appearances a good girl too describing her generally i may say that she had a small head well carved and well set on her shoulders bright gray eyes that looked at you honestly and meant what they looked a trim slight figure too slight on english ears
5142-36377-0015	our first impressions of people are in nine cases out of ten the right impressions
5142-36377-0016	for once in a way i proved a true prophet
5142-36377-0017	the only cheerful conversation was the conversation across the table between neomi and me
5142-36377-0018	he looked up at naomi doubtfully from his plate and looked down again slowly with a frown
5142-36377-0019	when i addressed him he answered contraintedly
5142-36377-0020	more dreary and more disunited family party i never sat at the table with
5142-36377-0021	envy hatred malice and uncharitableness are never so essentially detestable to my mind as when they are animated by the sense of propriety and work under the surface but for my interest in neymie and my other interest in the little love locks which i now and then despised passing between her and ambassadors i should never have sat through that supper
5142-36377-0022	i wish you good night she laid her bonny hands on the back of mister medecoff's invalid chair cut him short in his farewell salutation to me and weeled him out to his bed as if she were wheeling him out to his grave
5142-36377-0023	you were quite right to say no ambrus began never smoke with john iago his cigars will poison you
5142-36377-0024	neyomi shook her forehead reproachfully at them as if the two sturdy young farmers had been two children
5142-36377-0025	alice sank away without a word of protest arambo stood his ground evidently bent on making his peace with neomi before he left her seeing that i was in the way i walked aside toward a glass door at the lower end of the room
5142-36600-0000	chapter seven on the races of man
5142-36600-0001	in determining whether two or more allied forms ought to be ranked as species or varieties naturalists are practically guided by the following considerations namely the amount of difference between them and whether they are of physical importance but more especially whether they are constant
5142-33396-0000	at another time harold asked
5142-33396-0001	what is your country olaf have you always been a thrall the thrall's eyes flashed
5142-33396-0002	two hundred warriors feasted in his hall and followed him to battle
5142-33396-0003	the rest of you off a viking he had three ships
5142-33396-0004	these he gave to three of my brothers
5142-33396-0005	but i stayed that spring and built me a boat
5142-33396-0006	i made her for only twenty oars because i thought few men would follow me for i was young fifteen years old
5142-33396-0007	at the prow i carved the head with open mouth and forked tongue thrust out
5142-33396-0008	i painted the eyes red for anger
5142-33396-0009	there stand so i said and glare and hiss at my foes
5142-33396-0010	in the stern i carved the tail up almost as high as the head
5142-33396-0011	there she sat on the rollers as fair a ship as i ever saw
5142-33396-0012	then i will get me a farm and will win in that land now who will follow me
5142-33396-0013	he is but a boy the man said
5142-33396-0014	thirty men one after another raised their horns and said
5142-33396-0015	as our boat flashed down the rollers into the water i made this song and sang it
5142-33396-0016	so we harried the coast of norway
5142-33396-0017	we ate at many men's tables uninvited
5142-33396-0018	my dragons belly is never full and on board went the gold
5142-33396-0019	oh it is better to live on the sea and let other men raise your crops and cook your meals
5142-33396-0020	a house smells a smoke a sheep smells of frankincense
5142-33396-0021	up and down the water we went to get much wealth and much frolic
5142-33396-0022	what of the farm olaf not yet i answered baking is better for summer
5142-33396-0023	it was so dark that i could see nothing but a few sparks on the hearth
5142-33396-0024	i stood with my back to the wall for i wanted no sword reaching out of the dark for me
5142-33396-0025	come come i called when no one obeyed a fire
5142-33396-0026	my men laughed yes a stinging hose
5142-33396-0027	he acts as though he had not expected us
5142-33396-0028	on a bench in a far corner were a dozen people huddled together
5142-33396-0029	bring in the table we are hungry
5142-33396-0030	the thralls were bringing in a great pot of meat
5142-33396-0031	they set up a crane over the fire and hung the pot upon it and we sat and watched it boil while we joked at last the supper began
5142-33396-0032	the farmer sat gloomily on the bench and would not eat and you cannot wonder for he saw us putting potfuls of his good beef and bacon leftovers into our big mouths
5142-33396-0033	you would not eat with us you cannot say no to half of my ale i drink this to your health
5142-33396-0034	then i drank half of the hornful and set the rest across the fire to the farmer he took it and smiled saying
5142-33396-0035	did you ever have such a lordly guest before i went on
5142-33396-0036	so i will give out this law that my men shall never leave you alone
5142-33396-0037	hawk and there shall be your constant companion friend farmer
5142-33396-0038	he shall not leave you day or night whether you are working or playing or sleeping or sleeping
5142-33396-0039	i named none others and said
5142-33396-0040	and these shall follow your thralls in the same way
5142-33396-0041	so i set guards over every one in that house
5142-33396-0042	so no tails got out to the neighbors besides it was a lonely place and by good luck no one came that way
5142-33396-0043	their eyes danced big torlefs stood up and stretched himself
5142-33396-0044	im stiff with long sitting he said i itch for a fight i turned to the farmer
5142-33396-0045	this is our last feast with you i said
5142-33396-0046	by the beard of odin i cried you have taken our joke like a man
5142-33396-0047	my men pounded the table with their fists
5142-33396-0048	by the hamoura thore shouted grim there is no stinging coward
5142-33396-0049	here friend take it and he thrust it into the farmer's hand
5142-33396-0050	may you drink hart's ease from it for many years
5142-33396-0051	and with it i leave you a name sift the friendly i shall hope to drink with you some time in valhalla
5142-33396-0052	here is a ring for saf the friend and here is a bracelet and a sword would not be ashamed to hang at your side
5142-33396-0053	i took five great bracelets of gold from our treasure chest and gave them to him
5142-33396-0054	that is the best way to decide for the spear will always point somewhere and one thing is as good as another
5142-33396-0055	that time it pointed us into your father's ships
5142-33396-0056	here they said is a rascal who has been harrying our coast
5142-33396-0057	we sunk a ship and men but him we brought to you
5142-33396-0058	aroobor vikings said the king and he scowled at me
5142-33396-0059	yes and with all your fingers it took you a year to catch me the king frowned more angrily
5142-33396-0060	take him out torkle and let him taste your sword
5142-33396-0061	your mother the queen was standing by
5142-33396-0062	now she put her hand on his arm and smiled and said
5142-33396-0063	and would he not be a good gift for our baby
5142-33396-0064	your father thought a moment then looked at your mother and smiled
5142-33396-0065	soft heart he said gently to her then to torkle well let him go torkle
5142-33396-0066	then he turned to me again frowning
5142-33396-0067	but young sharp tongue now that we have caught you we will put you into a trap that you cannot get out of
5142-33396-0068	so i lived and now am your tooth thral well it is the luck of war
5142-36586-0000	it is manifest that man is now subject to much variability
5142-36586-0001	so it is with the lower animals
5142-36586-0002	the variability of multiple parts
5142-36586-0003	but this subject will be more properly discussed when we treat of the different races of man kind
5142-36586-0004	effects of the increased use and disuse of parts
8455-210777-0000	i remained there alone for many hours but i must acknowledge that before i left the chambers i had gradually brought myself to look at the matter in another light
8455-210777-0001	had evremon cresswell not been good looking had jack been still at college had sir kennington oval remained in england had mister bunnett and the barkeeper not succeeded in stopping my carriage on the hill should i have succeeded in arranging for the final departure of my old friend
8455-210777-0002	on arriving at home at my own residence i found that our salon was filled with a brilliant company
8455-210777-0003	as i spoke i made him a gracious bow and i think i showed him by my mode of address that i did not bear any grudge as to my individual self
8455-210777-0004	have come to your shores mister president with the purpose of seeing how things are progressing in this distant quarter of the world
8455-210777-0005	we have our little struggles here as elsewhere and all things cannot be done by rose water
8455-210777-0006	we are quite satisfied now captain batalax said my wife
8455-210777-0007	quite satisfied said eva
8455-210777-0008	the ladies and compliance with that softness of heart which is their characteristic or on one side and the men by whom the world has to be managed are on the other
8455-210777-0009	now doubt in process of time the ladies will follow
8455-210777-0010	their masters said missus neverbind
8455-210777-0011	did not mean said captain badalax to touch upon public subjects at such a moment as this
8455-210777-0012	missus neverben you must indeed be proud of your son
8455-210777-0013	jack had been standing in the far corner of the room talking to eva and was now reduced to silence by his praises
8455-210777-0014	 sir kennington oval is a very fine player said my wife
8455-210777-0015	ye and my wife and son and the two creswellers and three or four others agreed to dine on board the ship on the next
8455-210777-0016	this i felt was paid to me as being present of the republic and i endeavored to behave myself with such mingled humility and dignity as might befit the occasion but i could not but feel that something was wanting to the simplicity of my ordinary life
8455-210777-0017	my wife on the spur of the moment managed to give the gentleman a very good dinner
8455-210777-0018	this she said was true hospitality and i am not sure that i did not agree with her
8455-210777-0019	then there were three or four leading men of the community with their wives who were for the most part the fathers and mothers of the young ladies
8455-210777-0020	oh yes said jack and i'm nowhere
8455-210777-0021	but i mean to have my innings before long
8455-210777-0022	of what missus neverben had gone through in providing birds beasts and fishes not to talk of tarts and jellys for the dinner of that day no one but myself can have any idea but it must be admitted that she accomplished her task with thorough success
8455-210777-0023	we sat with the officer some little time after dinner and then went ashore
8455-210777-0024	how much of evil a real accomplished evil had there not occurred to me during the last few days
8455-210777-0025	what could i do now but just lay myself down and die
8455-210777-0026	and the death of which i dreamed could not alas
8455-210777-0027	when this captain should have taken himself and his vessel back to england i would retire to a small farm which i possessed at the furthest side of the island and there in seclusion would i end my days
8455-210777-0028	jack would become evas's happy husband and would remain amidst the hurried duties of the eager world
8455-210777-0029	thinking of all this i went to sleep
8455-210777-0030	master never bend began the captain and i observed that up to that moment he had generally addressed me as president it cannot be denied that we have come here on an unpleasant mission
8455-210777-0031	you have received us with all that courtesy and hospitality for which your character in england stand so high
8455-210777-0032	it is a duty said i
8455-210777-0033	but your power is so superior to any that i can advance as to make us here feel that there is no disgrace in yielding to it
8455-210777-0034	not a doubt but had your force been only double or triple our own i should have found it my duty to struggle with you
8455-210777-0035	that is all quite true mister neverben said sir friedman and co
8455-210777-0036	i can afford to smile because i am absolutely powerless before you but i do not the less feel that in a matter of which the progress of the world is concerned i or rather we have been put down by brute force
8455-210777-0037	you have come to us threatening us with absolute destruction
8455-210777-0038	therefore i feel myself quite able as president of this republic to receive you with a courtesy due to the service of a friendly ally
8455-210777-0039	i can assure you he has not even allowed me to see the trigger since i have been on board
8455-210777-0040	then said sir ferdinand there is nothing for it but that we must take you with him
8455-210777-0041	there came upon me a sudden shock when i heard these words which exceeded anything which i had yet felt
8455-210777-0042	you hear what sir ferdinand brown has said replied captain baldaxac
8455-210777-0043	but what is delectable mission i asked
8455-210777-0044	was to be taken away and carried to england or elsewhere or drowned upon the voyage it mattered not which
8455-210777-0045	then the republic of britain eula was to be declared as non existent and the british flag was to be exalted and a british governor installed in the executive chambers
8455-210777-0046	you may be quite sure it's there said captain baldacque and that i can so use it as to half obliterate your town within two minutes of my return on board
8455-210777-0047	you propose to kidnap me i said
8455-210777-0048	what would become of your gun were i to kinnap you
8455-210777-0049	lieutenant crosby's is a very gallant officer
8455-210777-0050	one of us always remains on board while the other is on shore
8455-210777-0051	what world wide innocence such a speech as that describes said i still turning myself to the captain for though i would have crushed them both by my words had it been possible my dislike centered itself on sir ferdinand and
8455-210777-0052	you will allow me to suggest said he that that is a matter of opinion
8455-210777-0053	were i to comply with your orders without expressing my own opinion i should seem to have done so willingly hereafter
8455-210777-0054	the letter ran as follows
8455-210777-0055	ser i have it in command to inform your excellency that you have been appointed governor of the crown colony which is called britain uula
8455-210777-0056	the peculiar circumstances of the colony are within your excellency's knowledge
8455-210777-0057	but in their selection of a constitution the britons have unfortunately allowed themselves but one deliberate assembly and hence have sprung their present difficulties
8455-210777-0058	it is founded on the acknowledged weakness of those who survive that period of life at which men cease to work
8455-210777-0059	but it is surmised that you will find difficulties in the way of your entering at once upon your governor
8455-210777-0060	the john bright is armed with a weapon of great power against which it is impossible that the people of britain yula should prevail
8455-210777-0061	you will carry out with you one hundred men of the north northwest burringham regiment which will probably suffice for your own security as it is thought that if mister neverben be withdrawn the people will revert easily to their old habits of obedience
8455-210777-0062	when do you intend that the job bright shall start
8455-210777-0063	to day i shouted
8455-210777-0064	and i have no one ready to whom i can give up the arcs of the government
8455-210777-0065	i shall be happy to take charge of them said sir ferdinand and
8455-210777-0066	they of course must all be auctioned
8455-210777-0067	or of the habits of our people it is quite impossible
8455-210777-0068	your power is sufficient i said
8455-210777-0069	if you will give us your promise to meet captain addison here at this time tomorrow we will stretch a point and delay the departure of the john bright for twenty four hours
8455-210777-0070	and this plan was adopted too in order to extract from me a promise that i would depart in peace
2830-3980-0000	in every way they sought to undermine the authority of saint paul
2830-3980-0001	they said to the gelatinous you have no right to think highly of paul
2830-3980-0002	he was the last to turn to christ
2830-3980-0003	pol came later and is beneath us
2830-3980-0004	indeed he persecuted the church of christ for a long time
2830-3980-0005	do you suppose that god for the sake of a few laurean heroes would dishonor his entire church
2830-3980-0006	against these boasting false ossuls paul boldly defends his apostolic authority and ministry
2830-3980-0007	as the ambassador of a government is honored for his office and not for his private person so the minister of crime should exalt his office in order to gain authority among men
2830-3980-0008	pol takes pride in his ministry not to his own praise but to the praise of god
2830-3980-0009	pull an apple not of men et cetera
2830-3980-0010	either he calls ministers through the agency of men or he calls them directly as he called the prophets and apostles
2830-3980-0011	pal declares that the false ossils were called or sent neither by men nor by man
2830-3980-0012	the most they could claim is that they were sent by others
2830-3980-0013	he mentions the apostles first because they were appointed directly by god
2830-3980-0014	the call is not to be taken lightly
2830-3980-0015	for a person to possess knowledge is not enough
2830-3980-0016	it spoils one's best work
2830-3980-0017	when i was a young man i thought paul was making too much of his call
2830-3980-0018	i did not then realize the importance of the ministry
2830-3980-0019	i knew nothing of the doctrine of faith because we were taught sophistry instead of certainty and nobody understood spiritual boasting
2830-3980-0020	this is no sinful pride it is wholly pride
2830-3980-0021	and god the father who raised him from the dead
2830-3980-0022	the cloak seemed superfluous on first sight
2830-3980-0023	these purters of the righteousness of christ resist the father and the son and the works of them both
2830-3980-0024	in this whole apocalypse paul treats of the resurrection of christ
2830-3980-0025	by his resolution crisp won the victory over law sin flesh world devil death hell and every evil
2830-3980-0026	first two
2830-3980-0027	and all the brethren which are with me
2830-3980-0028	this should go far in shutting the mouths of the false pistols
2830-3980-0029	although the brethren with me are not allies like myself yet there are all of one mind with me think right and teach as i do
2830-3980-0030	they do not go where the enemies of the gospel predominant they go where the christians are
2830-3980-0031	why did they not invade the catholic provinces and preach their doctrine to godless princes bishops and doctors as we have done by the help of god
2830-3980-0032	we look for that reward which i have not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man
2830-3980-0033	not all the glaciers had become perturbed
2830-3980-0034	these means cannot be contaminated
2830-3980-0035	they remained divine regardless of men's opinion
2830-3980-0036	wherever the means of grace are found there is the holy church even though antichrist reigns there
2830-3980-0037	so much for the title of the apostle now follows the greeting of the apostle verse three
2830-3980-0038	grace be to you and peace from god the father and from our lord jesus christ
2830-3980-0039	the terms of grace and peace are common terms with paul and are now pretty well understood
2830-3980-0040	the greeting of the apostle is refreshing
2830-3980-0041	grace involves the removal of sins peace and a happy conscience
2830-3980-0042	the world brands this a pernicious doctrine
2830-3980-0043	experience proves this
2830-3980-0044	however the grace and peace of god will
2830-3980-0045	men should not speculate about the nature of god
2830-3980-0046	was it not enough to say from god the father
2830-3980-0047	to do so is to lose god altogether because god becomes intolerable when we seek to measure and to comprehend his infinite majesty
2830-3980-0048	he came down to earth lived among men suffered was crucified and then he died standing clearly before us so that our hearts and eyes may fasten upon him
2830-3980-0049	embrace him and forget about the nature of god
2830-3980-0050	did not christ himself say i am the way and the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me
2830-3980-0051	when you argue about the nature of god a part from the question of justification you may be as profound as you like
2830-3980-0052	we are to hear christ who has been appointed by the father as our divine teacher
2830-3980-0053	at the same time paul comforts our creed that christ is very god
2830-3980-0054	that christ is very god is apparent in that paul describes to him divine powers equally with the father as for instance the power to descend grace and peace
2830-3980-0055	to bestow peace and grace in the province of god who alone can create these blessings the angels cannot
2830-3980-0056	otherwise pall should have written grace from god the father and peace from our lord jesus christ
2830-3980-0057	the errands took crime for a noble and perfect creature superior even to the angels because by him god created heaven and earth
2830-3980-0058	mo hamid also speaks highly of christ
2830-3980-0059	pol stick to his theme
2830-3980-0060	he never loses sight of the purpose of his island
2830-3980-0061	not gold or silver or patchy lambs or an angel but himself what for
2830-3980-0062	not for a crown or a kingdom or our goodness but for our sins
2830-3980-0063	understore these words for they are full of comfort for sore consciences
2830-3980-0064	how may we obtain remission of our sins
2830-3980-0065	pol answers the man who is named jesus christ and the son of god gave himself for our sins
2830-3980-0066	since christ was given for our sins it stands to reason that they cannot be put away by our own efforts
2830-3980-0067	this sentence also defines our sins as great so great a fact that the whole world could not make amends for a single sin
2830-3980-0068	the greatness of the ransom Christ the son of god indicates this
2830-3980-0069	the vicious character of sin is brought out by the words who gave himself for our sins
2830-3980-0070	but we are careless we make light of sin
2830-3980-0071	we think that by some little work or merit we can dismiss sin
2830-3980-0072	this passage then bears out the fact that all men are sold under sin
2830-3980-0073	this attitude springs from a false conception of sin the conception that sin is a small matter easily taken care of by good works that we must present ourselves unto god with a good conscience that we must feel no sin before we may feel that christ was given for our sins
2830-3980-0074	this attitude is universal and particularly developed in those who consider themselves better than others
2830-3980-0075	but the real significance and comfort of the words for our sins is lost upon them
2830-3980-0076	on the other hand we are not to regard them as so terrible that we must despair
2830-3979-0000	we want you to help us publish some leading work of writers for the general american market will you do it
2830-3979-0001	the condition is that i will be permitted to make laurean talk american stream line him so to speak because you will never get people whether in or outside the laurean church actually to read laurean unless we make him talk as he would talk to day to americans
2830-3979-0002	let us begin with that his commercial analogies
2830-3979-0003	the undertaking which seemed so attractive when viewed as a literary task proved a most difficult one and at times became oppressive
2830-3979-0004	it was written in latin
2830-3979-0005	the work had to be condensed
2830-3979-0006	the word should now be said about the origin of luther's contemporary analogies
2830-3979-0007	much later when a friend of his was preparing an edition of all his latin works he remarked to his home circle if i had my way about it they would reproduce only those of my books which have doctor myallations for instance
2830-3979-0008	in other words these three men took down the legends which luther addressed to his students in the course of galations and rour prepared the manuscript for the printer
2830-3979-0009	it presents like no other of dutch's writings the central thought of christianity the justification of the sinner for the sake of christ merits alone
2830-3979-0010	but the essence of luther's lectures is there
2830-3979-0011	the lord who has given us power to teach and to hear let him also give us the power to serve and to do luc two
2830-3979-0012	the word of our god shall stand forever
4446-2271-0000	maenald liked alexander because he was an engineer
4446-2271-0001	he had conceived ideas about everything and his idea about americans was that they should be engineers mechanics
4446-2271-0002	it's tremendously well put on too
4446-2271-0003	it's been on only two weeks and i've been half a dozen times already
4446-2271-0004	do you know alexander maneal looked with perplexity up into the top of the hemisphere and rubbed his pink cheek with his gloved finger do you know i sometimes think of taking to criticism seriously myself
4446-2271-0005	she saves her hand too she's at her best in the second act
4446-2271-0006	he's been wanting to marry hilda these three years and more
4446-2271-0007	she doesn't take up with anybody you know
4446-2271-0008	irene begone one of her family told me in confidence that there was a romance somewhere back in the beginning
4446-2271-0009	maenhole vaulted for her constancy with a loftiness that made alexander smile even while a kind of rapid excitement was tingling through him
4446-2271-0010	he's another who's awfully keen about her let me introduce you
4446-2271-0011	 sir harry town mister bartle alexander the american engineer
4446-2271-0012	i say sir harry the little girls are going famously tonight isn't she
4446-2271-0013	you know i thought the dance of bit conservative to night for the first time
4446-2271-0014	westmere and i were back after the first act and we thought she seemed quite uncertain of herself
4446-2271-0015	a little attack of nerves possibly
4446-2271-0016	he was beginning to feel a keen interest in the slender barefoot donkey girl who slipped in and out of the play singing like some one winding through a hilly field
4446-2271-0017	one night when he and winchester were sitting together on the bridge he told that things had happened while he was studying abroad that he was sorry for one thing in particular and he asked her whether she thought she ought to know about them
4446-2271-0018	she considered for a moment and then said no i think not though i am glad you ask me
4446-2271-0019	after that it was easy to forget actually to forget
4446-2271-0020	of course he reflected she always had that combination of something homely and sensible and something utterly wild and daft
4446-2271-0021	she must care about the theatre a great deal more than she used to
4446-2271-0022	um glad she's held her own since
4446-2271-0023	after all we were awfully young
4446-2271-0024	i shouldn't wonder if she could laugh about it with me now
4446-2273-0000	hillda was very nice to him and he sat on the edge of his chair flushed with his conversational efforts and moving his chin about nervously over his high collar
4446-2273-0001	they asked him to come to see them in chelsea and they spoke very tenderly of hilda
4446-2273-0002	lam would care a great deal about many of them i fancy
4446-2273-0003	when bartley arrived at bedford square on sunday evening merrick the pretty little french girl met him at the door and conducted him upstairs
4446-2273-0004	i should never have asked you if molly had been here for i remember you don't like english cookery
4446-2273-0005	i haven't had a chance yet to tell you what a jolly little place i think this is
4446-2273-0006	they are all skirts made about the ville de stey you see
4446-2273-0007	those fellows are all very loyal even maneau
4446-2273-0008	if i've managed to save something every year and that with helping my three sisters now and then and tying poor cousin mike over bad seasons
4446-2273-0009	it's not particularly rare she said but some of it was my mother's
4446-2273-0010	there was water creek soup and sole and a delightful omlet stuffed with mushrooms and truffles and two small rare ducklings and arctic chops and a dry yellow roasted wine of which bartley had always been very fond
4446-2273-0011	there is nothing else that looks so jolly
4446-2273-0012	thank you but i don't like it so well as this
4446-2273-0013	have you been in paradise much these late years
4446-2273-0014	there are few changes in the old quarter
4446-2273-0015	don't i though i'm so sorry to hear it how did her son turn out
4446-2273-0016	her hair is still like flax and her blue eyes are just like a babies and she has the same three flocks on her little nose and talks about going back to our bandit mera
4446-2273-0017	how jolly it was being young hilda
4446-2273-0018	do you remember that first walk we took together in paris
4446-2273-0019	come we'll have our coffee in the other room and you can smoke
4446-2273-0020	i think we did she answered demurely
4446-2273-0021	what she wanted from us was neither our flowers nor our frank but just our youth
4446-2273-0022	they were both remembering what the woman had said when she took the money god give you a happy love
4446-2273-0023	the strange woman and her passionate sentence that rang out so sharply had frightened them both
4446-2273-0024	barley started when hilla rang the little bell beside her dear me why did you do that
4446-2273-0025	it was very jolly he murmured lazily as merrick came in to take away the coffee
4446-2273-0026	have i told you about my new play
4446-2273-0027	when she finished alexander shook himself out of a reverie
4446-2273-0028	once of course i can't really sing except the way my mother and grandmother did before me
4446-2273-0029	it's really too warm in this room to sing don't you feel it
4446-2273-0030	alexander went over and opened the window for her
4446-2273-0031	there just in front
4446-2273-0032	he stood a little behind her and tried to steady himself as he said it's soft and misty see how white the stars are
4446-2273-0033	for a long time neither hilda nor barty spoke
4446-2273-0034	he felt a tremor run through the slender yellow figure in front of him
4446-2273-0035	bartley leaned over her shoulder without touching her and whispered in her ear you are giving me a chance yes
4446-2273-0036	alexander clenching the two hands at his sides
4446-2275-0000	the stop at queens town the tedious passage up the mercy were things that he noted dimly through his growing impatience
4446-2275-0001	she blushed and smiled and fumbled his card in her confusion before she ran upstairs
4446-2275-0002	alexander paced up and down the hallway buttoning and unbuttering his overcoat until she returned and took him up to hillside living room
4446-2275-0003	the room was empty when he entered
4446-2275-0004	alexander did not sit down
4446-2275-0005	i felt it in my bones when i woke this morning that something splendid was going to turn up
4446-2275-0006	i thought it might be sister katy or cousin mike would be happening along
4446-2275-0007	she pushed him toward the big chair by the fire and sat down on a stool at the opposite side of the hearth her knees drawn up to her chin laughing like a happy little girl
4446-2275-0008	when did you come bartle and how did it happen you haven't spoken a word
4446-2275-0009	i got in about ten minutes ago
4446-2275-0010	alexander leaned forward and warmed his hands before the blaze
4446-2275-0011	bartley bent lower over the fire
4446-2275-0012	she looked at his heavy shoulders and big determined head thrust forward like a cadap in lace
4446-2275-0013	ill do anything you wish me to bartle she said tremulously
4446-2275-0014	i can't stand seeing you miserable
4446-2275-0015	he pulled up a window as if the air were heavy
4446-2275-0016	hillda watched him from the corner trembling and scarcely breathing dark shadows growing about her eyes it
4446-2275-0017	but it's worse now it's unbearable
4446-2275-0018	i get nothing but misery out of either
4446-2275-0019	the world is all there just as it used to be but i can't get at it any more
4446-2275-0020	it was myself i was defying hilda
4446-2275-0021	hill's face quivered but she whispered yes i think it must have been
4446-2275-0022	but why didn't you tell me when you were here in the summer
4446-2275-0023	alexander groaned i meant to but somehow i couldn't
4446-2275-0024	she pressed his hand gently in gratitude
4446-2275-0025	 weren't you happy then at all
4446-2275-0026	she closed her eyes and took a deep breath as if to draw in again the fragrance of those days
4446-2275-0027	he moved uneasily and his chair creaked
4446-2275-0028	yes yes she hurried pulling her head gently away from him
4446-2275-0029	please tell me one thing bartley at least tell me that you believe i thought i was making you happy
4446-2275-0030	yes hilda i know that he said simply
4446-2275-0031	i understand bartley i was wrong
4446-2275-0032	but i didn't know you've only to tell me now
4446-2275-0033	what i mean is that i want you to promise never to see me again no matter how often i come no matter how hard i beg
4446-2275-0034	keep away if you wish when i ever followed you
4446-2275-0035	alexander rose and shook himself angrily yes i know i'm cowardly
4446-2275-0036	he took her roughly in his arms do you know what i mean
4446-2275-0037	oh bartley what am i to do
4446-2275-0038	i will ask the least imaginable but i must have something
4446-2275-0039	i must know about you
4446-2275-0040	the sight of you bartle to see you living and happy and successful can i never make you understand what that means to me
4446-2275-0041	you see loving some one as i love you makes the whole world different
4446-2275-0042	and then you came back not caring very much but it made no difference
4446-2275-0043	bartley bent over and took her in his arms kissing her mouth and her wet tired eyes
4446-2275-0044	don't cry don't cry he whispered
4446-2275-0045	we've tortured each other enough for to night
4077-13754-0000	the army found the people in poverty and left them in comparative wealth
4077-13754-0001	but a word further concerning the expedition in general
4077-13754-0002	it was through floydus advice that buccanean ordered the military expedition to utah obstinately to install federal officials and to repress and alleged infantile rebellion which fact had never come into existence but in reality to further the interests of thecessionists
4077-13754-0003	moreover had the people been inclined to rebellion what greater opportunity could they have wished
4077-13754-0004	already a north and a south were talked of why not set up also a west
4077-13754-0005	they knew no north no south no east no west they stood positively by the constitution and would have nothing to do in the bloody strife between brothers unless indeed they were summoned by the authority to which they had already once loyalty responded to furnish men and arms for the country's need
4077-13754-0006	what the latter saints call sexual marriage is characteristic of the church and is in very general practice but of celestial marriage polarity of wives was an incident never an accident
4077-13754-0007	we believe in a literal resolution and an actual hereafter in which future state shall be recognized every sanctified and orthodox religion existing here on earth of parent and child brother and sister husband and wife
4077-13754-0008	it has been my privilege to tread the soil of many lands to observe the customs and study the habits of more nations than one and i have yet to find the place and meet the people where and with whom the purity of man and woman is held more precious than among the multiformes in the mountain valleys of the west
4077-13754-0009	at the intersection of purple marriage among the latter day saints there was no law national or state against its practice
4077-13754-0010	in eighteen sixty two a law was enacted with a purpose of suppressing plural marriage and as had been predicted in the national senate prior to its passage it lay for many years a dead letter
4077-13754-0011	fatal judgments and united states attornies in utah who were not mortals nor lovers of mormonism refused to entertain complaints or prosecute cases under the law because of its manifest injustice and iniquity
4077-13754-0012	this meant that for an alleged misdemeanor for which congress prescribed a maximum penalty of six months imprisonment and a fine of three hundred dollars a man might be imprisoned for life i for many terms of a man's natural life did the courts power to enforce its sentences extend so far and might be fined millions of dollars
4077-13754-0013	before this tragedy on the administration of law could be brought before the court of last resort and there met with the revulse and rebuke it deserved men were imprisoned under sentence of many years detention
4077-13754-0014	the people contested these measures one by one in the courts presenting in case after case the different fases of the subject and urging the unconstitutionality of the measure
4077-13754-0015	then the church was disencouraged and its property both real and personal confiscated and issued to the government of the united states and although the personal property were soon restored restate of great value long lay in the hands of the courts receiver and the mormon church had to pay the national government high rent on its own property
4077-13754-0016	and so the story of mormonism runs on its fanalty has not yet been written the current press presents continually new stages of its progress new developments of its plan
4077-13751-0000	on the sixth of april eighteen thirty the church of jesus christ of london saints was formerly organized and thus took on a legal existence
4077-13751-0001	its origin was small a germ an insignificant seed hardly to be thought of as likely to arouse opposition
4077-13751-0002	instead of but six regularly affiliated members and at most two score of adherents the organization numbers to day many hundred thousand souls
4077-13751-0003	in place of a single hamlet in the smallest corner of which the members could have congregated there now are about seventy stakes of zion and about seven hundred organized wards each ward and stake with its full complement of officers and principal organizations
4077-13751-0004	the practice of gathering its prosiles into one place prevents the building up and strengthening of foreign branches and inasmuch as extensive and strong organizations are seldom met with abroad very erroneous ideas existing concerning the strength of the church
4077-13751-0005	nevertheless the mustered seed among the smallest of all seeds has attained the proportions of a tree and the birds of the air are nesting in its branches the acre is now an oak offering protection and the sweets of satisfaction to every earnest pilgrim journeying its way for truth
4077-13751-0006	their eyes were from the first turned in anticipation toward the evening sun not merely that the work of proselytizing should be carried on in the west but that the headquarters of the church should be there established
4077-13751-0007	the book o morn had taught the people the true origin and destiny of the american indians and toward this dark skinned remnant of a once mighty people the minorities of mormonism early turned their eyes and with their eyes went their hearts and their hopes
4077-13751-0008	it is notable that the indian tribes have generally regarded the religion of the latter day saints with favor seeing in the book of mormon striking agreement with their own traditions
4077-13751-0009	the first well established seat of the church was in the pretty little town of curtland ohio almost within sight of lake erie and here soon rose the first temple of modern times
4077-13751-0010	to the fervent laboratory saint a temple is not simply a church building a house for a religious assembly
4077-13751-0011	soon thousands of convents had rented or purchased homes in mesurie independence jackson county being their center but from the first they were unpopular among the mesurians
4077-13751-0012	the lieutenant governor lilburn butts afterward governor was a pronounced mormon hater and throughout the period of the troubles he manifest his sympathy with the persecutors
4077-13751-0013	their sufferings have never yet been fully chronicled by human scribe
4077-13751-0014	making their way across the river most of the refugees found shelter among the more hospitable people of clay county and afterward established themselves in coldwell county therein founding the city of far west
4077-13751-0015	a small settlement had been founded by mormon families on shale creek and here on the thirtieth of october eighteen thirty eight a company of two hundred and forty fell upon the haphazard settlers and butchered a score
4077-13751-0016	be it said to the honor of some of the officers entrusted with a terrible commission that when they learned its true significance they resigned their authority rather than have anything to do with what they designated a cold blooded butcherery
4077-13751-0017	oh what a record to read what a picture to gaze upon how awful the fact
4077-13751-0018	american schools read with emotions of horror of the albiges driven beaten and killed with a paddle legate directing the butchery and of the vodeur hunted like beasts as the effect of a royal decree and they yet shall read in the history of their own country of scenes as terrible as these in the exhibition of injustice and humiliation hate
4077-13751-0019	who began the quarrel was it the mormons
4077-13751-0020	as the sample of the present comments against the brutality of the mirrians i quote a paragraph from the quincy argus march sixteen eighteen thirty nine
4077-13751-0021	it will be observed that an organized mob aided by many of the civil and military officers of mosier with governor boggs at their head have been the prominent actors in this business incited too it appears against the mormons by political hatred and by the official motives of plunder and revenge
1221-135767-0000	hester prin went one day to the mansion of governor belingham with a pair of gloves which he had fringed and embroidered to his order and which were to be worn on some great occasion of state for though the chances of a popular election had caused this former ruler to descend a step or two from the highest rank he still held an honorable and influential place among the colonial magistracy
1221-135767-0001	another and far more important reason than the delivery of a pair of embroidered gloves impelled hester at this time to seek an interview with a personage of so much power and activity in the affairs of the settlement
1221-135767-0002	at that epoch of pristine simplicity however matters of even slight public interest and of far less intrinsic weight than the welfare of hester and her child were strangely mixed up with the deliberations of legislators and acts of state
1221-135767-0003	the period was hardly if at all earlier than that of our story when a dispute concerning the right of property in a pig not only caused a fierce and bitter contest in the legislative body of the colony but resulted in an important modification of the framework itself of the legislation
1221-135767-0004	we have spoken of pearls rich and luxuriant beauty a beauty that shone with deep and vivid tints a bright complexion eyes possessing intensity both of depth and glow and hair already of a deep glossy brown and which in after years would be nearly akin to black
1221-135767-0005	it was the scarlet letter in another form the scarlet letter endowed with life
1221-135767-0006	the mother herself as if the red ignominy were so deeply scorched into her brain that all her conceptions assumed its form had carefully wrought out the similitude lavishing many hours of morbid ingenuity to create an analogy between the object of her affection and the emblem of her guilt and torture
1221-135767-0007	but in truth pearl was the one as well as the other and only in consequence of that identity had hester contrived so perfectly to represent the scarlet letter in her appearance
1221-135767-0008	come therefore and let us fling mud at them
1221-135767-0009	but purle who was a dauntless child after frowning stamping her foot and shaking her little hand with a variety of threatening gestures suddenly made a rush at the knot of her enemies and put them all to flight
1221-135767-0010	she screamed and shouted too with a terrific volume of sound which doubtless caused the hearts of the fugitives to quake within them
1221-135767-0011	it was further decorated with strange and seemingly catastrophic figures and diagrams suitable to the quaint taste of the age which had been drawn in the stucco when newly laid on and had now grown hard and durable for the admiration of after times
1221-135767-0012	they approached the door which was of an arched form and flanked on each side by a narrow tower or projection of the edifice in both of which were lattice windows the wooden shutters to close over them at need
1221-135767-0013	lifting the iron hammer that hung at the portal hester reyn gave a summons which was answered by one of the governor's servants a freeborn englishman but now a seven years slave
1221-135767-0014	yes his honorable worship is within but he have a godly minister or two with him and likewise a lease
1221-135767-0015	ye may not see his worship now
1221-135767-0016	with many variations suggested by the nature of his building materials diversity of climate and a different mode of social life governor bellingham had planned his new habitation after the residences of gentlemen of fair estate in his native land
1221-135767-0017	on the table invented that the sentiment of old english hospitality had not been left behind stood a large purple tankard at the bottom of which had herster or pearl peeped into it they might have seen the frothy remnant of a recent draft of ale
1221-135767-0018	little pearl who was as greatly pleased with the gleaming armor as she had been with the glittering front piece of the house spent some time looking into the polished mirror of the breastplate
1221-135767-0019	mother cried she i see you here look look
1221-135767-0020	in truth she seemed absolutely hidden behind it
1221-135767-0021	purle accordingly ran to the bow window at the farther end of the hall and looked along the vista of a garden walk carpeted with closely shaved grass and bordered with some rude and immature attempt at shrubbery
1221-135767-0022	but the proprietor appeared already to have relinquished as hopeless the effort to perpetuate on this side of the atlantic in a hard soil and amid the close struggle for subsistence the native english taste for original gardening
1221-135767-0023	there were a few rose bushes however and a number of apple trees probably the descendants of those planted by the reverend mister blackstone the first settler of the peninsula that half mythical personage who rides through our early annals seated on the back of a bull
1221-135767-0024	purle seeing the roses began to cry for a red rose and would not be pacified
1221-135766-0000	how strange it seemed to the sad woman as she watched the growth and the beauty that became every day more brilliant and the intelligence that threw its quivering sunshine over the tiny features of this child
1221-135766-0001	god as a direct consequence of the sin which man thus punished had given her a lovely child whose place was on that same dishonored bosom to connect her parent forever with the race and descent of mortals and to be finally a blessed soul in heaven
1221-135766-0002	yet these thoughts affected hester prine less with hope than apprehension
1221-135766-0003	the child had a native grace which does not invariably coincide with faultless beauty its attire however simple always impressed the beholder as if it were the very garb that precisely became it best
1221-135766-0004	this outward mutability indicated and did not more than fairly express the various properties of her inner life
1221-135766-0005	hester could only account for the child's character and even then most vaguely and imperfectly by recalling what she herself had been during that momentous period while purle was imbuing her soul from the spiritual world and her bodily frame from its material of earth
1221-135766-0006	they were now illuminated by the morning radiance of a young child's disposition but later in the day of early existence might be prophetic of the storm and whirlwind
1221-135766-0007	hester pren nevertheless the loving mother of this one child ran little risk of earning on the side of undue severity
1221-135766-0008	mindful however of her own errors and misfortunes she early sought to impose a tender but strict control over the infant immortality that was committed to her charge
1221-135766-0009	as to any other kind of discipline whether addressed to her mind or heart little pearl might or might not be within its reach in accordance with the caprice that ruled the moment
1221-135766-0010	it was a look so intelligent yet inexplicable perverse sometimes so malicious but generally accompanied by a wild flow of spirits that hester could not help questioning at such moments whether pearl was a human child
1221-135766-0011	beholding it hester was constrained to rush toward the child to pursue the little elf in the flight which she invariably began to snatch her to her bosom with a close pressure and earnest kisses not so much from overflowing love as to assure herself that pearl was flesh and blood and not utterly delusive
1221-135766-0012	brudding over all these matters the mother felt like one who has evolved a spirit but by some irregularity in the process of conjugation has failed to win the master word that should control this new and incomprehensible intelligence
1221-135766-0013	purle was a born outlaw of the infantile world
1221-135766-0014	purle saw and gazed intently but never sought to make acquaintance
1221-135766-0015	if spoken to she would not speak again
908-157963-0000	to fade away like morning beauty from her mortal day down by the river of odona her soft voice is heard and thus her gentle lamentation falls like morning dew
908-157963-0001	oh life of this our spring
908-157963-0002	why fades the locus of the water
908-157963-0003	why fade these children of the spring
908-157963-0004	thell is like a watery bow and like a parting cloud like a reflection in a glass like shadows in the water like dreams of infants like a smile upon an infant's face
908-157963-0005	like the dove's voice like tranquil day like music in the air ah
908-157963-0006	and gentle sleep the sleep of death and gently hear the voice of him that walk in the garden in the evening time
908-157963-0007	the lily of the valley breathing in the humble grass answered the lovely maid and said i am a watery weed and i am very small and love to dwell in the valley and each morn over me spreads his hand saying rejoice thou humble grass thou new born lily flower
908-157963-0008	thou gentle maid of silent valleys and of modest brooks for thou shalt be clothed in light and fed with morning manna till summer's heat melts thee beside the fountains and the springs to flourish in eternal veils they why should thouel complain
908-157963-0009	why should the mistress of the vales of haur utter a sigh
908-157963-0010	she ceased and smiled in tears then sat down in her silver shrine
908-157963-0011	which thou dost scatter on every little blade of grass that springs revives the milked cow and tames the fire breathing steed
908-157963-0012	but telle is like a faint cloud kindled at the rising sun i vanish from my purly throne and who shall find my place
908-157963-0013	and why it scatters its bright beauty through the humid air
908-157963-0014	descend a little cloud and hover before the eyes of hell
908-157963-0015	oh little cloud the virgin said i charge thee to tell me why thou complainest now when in one hour thou fad away then we shall seek thee but not find ah fell is like to thee
908-157963-0016	i pass away yet i complain and no one hears my voice
908-157963-0017	the cloud then showed his golden head and his bright form immersed
908-157963-0018	and fearest thou because i vanish and am seen no more
908-157963-0019	it is to tenfold life to love to peace and raptures wholly unseen descending wave my light wings upon balmy flowers and court the fair i do to take me to her shining tent the weeping virgin trembling heels before the risen sun
908-157963-0020	til we arise linked in a golden band and never part but walk united bearing food to all our tender flowers
908-157963-0021	lies not alone nor of itself fear not and i will call the weak worm from its lowly bed and thou shalt hear its voice
908-157963-0022	come forth worm and the silent valley to thy pensive queen
908-157963-0023	the helpless worm arose and sat upon the lily's leaf and the bright cloud sailed on to find his partner in the veil
908-157963-0024	image of weakness art thou but a worm
908-157963-0025	i see they lay helpless and naked weeping and none to answer none to cherish thee with mother's smiles
908-157963-0026	and says thou mother of my children i have loved thee and i have given thee a crown that none can take away
908-157963-0027	and lay me down in thy cold bed and leave my shining lot
908-157963-0028	or an eye of gifts and graces showering fruits and coin'd gold
908-157963-0029	why a tongue impressed with honey from every wind
908-157963-0030	why an ear a whirlpool fierce to draw creations in
908-31957-0000	all is said without a word
908-31957-0001	i sit beneath thy looks as children do in the noon sun with souls that tremble through their happy eyelids from an unaweded yet prodigious inward joy
908-31957-0002	i did not wrong myself so but i placed a wrong on thee
908-31957-0003	when called before i told how hastily i dropped my flowers or break off from a game
908-31957-0004	shall i never miss home talk and blessing and the common kiss that comes to each in turn nor count it strange when i look up to drop on a new range of walls and floors another home than this
908-31957-0005	alas i have grieved so i am hard to love
908-31957-0006	open thy heart wide and fold within the wet wings of thy dove
908-31957-0007	could it mean to last a love set pendulum between sorrow and sorrow
908-31957-0008	neigh i rather thrilled disturbing every light that seemed to guide the onward path and feared to overleane a finger even
908-31957-0009	and though i have grown serene and strong since then i think that god has willed a still renewable fear
908-31957-0010	oh love oh thrift
908-31957-0011	and love be false
908-31957-0012	if he to keep one oath must lose one joy by his life's star foretold
908-31957-0013	slow to world greetings quick with its o lit when the angel speak
908-31957-0014	a ring of amphithist i could not wear here plainer to my sight than that first kiss
908-31957-0015	that was the cranium of love which love's own crown with sanctifying sweetness did precede the third upon my lips was folded down in perfect purple state since when indeed i have been proud and said my love my own
908-31957-0016	dearest teach me so to pour out gratitude as thou dost good
908-31957-0017	mustelins and geyser throwed curtsies at a smile and have no ruth for any weeping
908-31957-0018	but thou art not such a lover my beloved
908-31957-0019	thou canst wait through sorrow and sickness to bring souls to touch and think it soon when others cry too late
908-31957-0020	i thank all who have loved me in their hearts with thanks and love from mine
908-31957-0021	oh to shoot my souls full meaning into future years that they should lend it utterance and salute love that endures from life that disappears
908-31957-0022	then i long tried by natural ils received the comfort fast while budding at thy sight my pilgrim staff gave out green leaves with morning dews impurled
908-31957-0023	i love thee freely as men strive for right i love thee purity as they turn from prays
908-31957-0024	i love thee with the passion put to use and my old griefs and with my childhood's faith
908-31957-0025	love thee with a love i seemed to lose with my lost saints i love thee with the breath smiles tears of all my life and if god choose i shall but love thee better after death
7021-79759-0000	nature of the fact produced by early impressions
7021-79759-0001	that is comparatively nothing
7021-79759-0002	they are chiefly formed from combinations of the impressions made in childhood
7021-79759-0003	fast importance and influence of this mental furnishing
7021-79759-0004	without going to any such extreme as this we can easily see on reflection how vast an influence on the ideas and conceptions as well as on the principles of action in mature years must be exerted by the nature and character of the images which the period of infancy and childhood impress upon the mind
7021-79759-0005	the pain produced by an act of hasty and angry violence to which a father subjects his son may soon pass away but the memory of it does not pass away with the pain
7021-79740-0000	to such persons these indirect modes of training children in habits of subordination to their will or rather of yielding to their influence are specially useful
7021-79740-0001	delta had a young sister named miria and a cousin whose name was jane
7021-79740-0002	now delia contrived to obtain a great influence and ascendancy over the minds of the children by means of these dolls
7021-79740-0003	to give an idea of these conversations i will report one of them in full
7021-79740-0004	you have come andela and della was the name of jane's doll to make rosalie a visit
7021-79740-0005	i am very glad
7021-79740-0006	i expect you have been a very good girl andela since you were here last
7021-79740-0007	then turning to jane she asked in a somewhat altered tone has she been a good girl jane
7021-79740-0008	for instance one day the children had been playing upon the pyramids with blocks and other playthings and finally had gone into the house leaving all the things on the floor of the pyramids instead of putting them away in their places as they ought to have done
7021-79740-0009	they were now playing with their dolls in the parlour
7021-79740-0010	delia came to the parlor and with an air of great mystery beckoned the children aside and said to them in a whisper leave andrea and rosalie here and don't say a word to them
7021-79740-0011	so saying she led the way on tiptoe followed by the children out of the room and round by a sorcerous route to the pyramids there
7021-79740-0012	said she pointing to the playthings see
7021-79740-0013	put these playthings all away quick and carefully and we will not let them know anything about your leaving them out
7021-79740-0014	and this method of treating the case was much more effective in making them dispose to avoid committing a similar fault another time than any direct rebukes or expressions of displeasure addressed personally to them would have been
7021-79730-0000	the three modes of management
7021-79730-0001	to suppose that the object of this work is to aid in affording such a substitution as that is entirely to mistake its nature and design
7021-79730-0002	by reason and affection
7021-79730-0003	as the chase drives away mary stands bewildered and perplexed on the doorstep her mind in a tumult of excitement in which the structure and development of the sole so closely depend doing perhaps an irreparable injury
7021-79730-0004	the mother as soon as the chase is so far turned that mary can no longer watch the expression of her countenance goes away from the door with a smile of complacency and satisfaction on her face at the ingenuity and success of her little artist
7021-79730-0005	so you will be a good girl i know and not make any trouble but will stay at home contentedly won't you
7021-79730-0006	the mother in managing the case in this way relies partly on convincing the reason of the child and partly on an appeal to her affection
7021-79730-0007	if you should not be a good girl but should show signs of making us any trouble i shall have to send you out somewhere to the back part of the house until we are gone
7021-79730-0008	but this last supposition is almost always unnecessary for if mary has been habitually managed on this principle she will not make any trouble
7021-79730-0009	it is indeed true that the importance of tact and skill in the training of the young and of cultivating their reason and securing their affection cannot be overrated
7021-85628-0000	but anders cared nothing about that
7021-85628-0001	he made a bow so deep that his back came near breaking and he was dumfounded i can tell you when he saw it was nobody but anders
7021-85628-0002	he was such a big boy that he wore high boots and carried a jackknife
7021-85628-0003	now this knife was a splendid one though half the blade was gone and the handle was a little cracked and anders knew that one is almost a man as soon as one has a jackknife
7021-85628-0004	yes why not thought anders
7021-85628-0005	seeing that i am so fine i may as well go and visit the king
7021-85628-0006	i am going to the court ball answered anderson
7021-85628-0007	and she took anderson's hand and walked with him up the broad marble stairs where soldiers were posted at every third step and through the magnificent halls where courtiers in silk and velvet stood bowing wherever he went
7021-85628-0008	for like as not they must have thought him a prince when they saw his fine cap
7021-85628-0009	at the farther end of the largest hall a table was set with golden cups and golden plates in long rows
7021-85628-0010	on huge silver platters were pyramids of tarts and cakes and red wine sparkled in glittering decanters
7021-85628-0011	the princess sat down under a blue canopy with cosmetics of roses and she let andrea sit in a golden chair by her side
7021-85628-0012	but you must not eat with your cap on your head she said and was going to take it off
7021-85628-0013	the princess certainly was beautiful and he would have dearly liked to be kissed by her but the cap which his mother had made he would not give up on any condition
7021-85628-0014	he only shook his head
7021-85628-0015	well but now said the princess and she filled his pockets with cakes and put her own heavy gold chain around his neck and bent down and kissed him
7021-85628-0016	that is a very fine cap you have he said
7021-85628-0017	so it is said anders
7021-85628-0018	and it is made of mother's best yarn and she knit it herself and everybody wants to get it away from me
7021-85628-0019	with one jump andanders got out of his chair
7021-85628-0020	he darted like an arrow through all the halls down all the stairs and across the yard
7021-85628-0021	he still held onto it with both hands as he rushed into his mother's cottage
7021-85628-0022	and all his brothers and sisters stood round and listened with their mouths open
7021-85628-0023	but when his big brother heard that he had refused to give his cap for a king's golden crown he said that andders were a stupid
7021-85628-0024	anders face grew red
7021-85628-0025	but his mother hugged him close
7021-85628-0026	now my little son she said
7021-85628-0027	if you dressed in silk and gold from top to toe you could not look any nicer than in your little red cap
8224-274384-0000	he passed through henley scent albans and came so near to london as harrow on the hill
8224-274384-0001	the scottish generals and commissioners affected great surprise on the appearance of the king and though they paid him all the extraordinary respect due to his dignity they instantly set a guard upon him under color of protection and made him in reality a prisoner
8224-274384-0002	they informed the english parliament of this unexpected incident and assured them that they had entered into no private treaty with the king
8224-274384-0003	or have he given us any gift
8224-274384-0004	and the men of israel answered the men of juda and said we have ten parts in the king and we have also more right inland than ye why then did ye despise us that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king
8224-274384-0005	another preacher after reproaching him to his face with his misgoverned ordered this psalm to be sung
8224-274384-0006	the king stood up and called for that sperm which begins with these words
8224-274384-0007	have mercy lord on me i pray for men would me devour
8224-274384-0008	the good natured audience in pity to fallen majesty showed for once greater deference to the king than to the minister and sung the psalm which the former had called for
8224-274384-0009	the parliament and the scouts laid their proposals before the king
8224-274384-0010	before the settlement of terms the administration must be possessed entirely by the parliaments of both kingdoms and how incompatible that scheme with the liberty of the king is easily imagined
8224-274384-0011	the english it is evident had they not been previously assured of receiving the king would never have parted with so considerable a sum and while they weakened themselves by the same measure have strengthened a people with whom they must afterwards have so material an interest to disgust
8224-274384-0012	if any still retained ranker against him in his present condition they passed in silence while his well wishers more generous than prudent accompanied his march with tears with acclamations and with prayers for his safety
8224-274384-0013	his death in this conjuncture was a public misfortune
8224-274381-0000	though thrown into prison for this enterprise and detained some time he was not disgraged but still continued by his countenance and protection to enforce spirit into the distressed roylists
8224-274381-0001	among other persons of distinction who united themselves to him were lord napier of murchiston the person to whom the title of a great man is more justly due than to any other whom his country ever produced
8224-274381-0002	while the former foretold that the scottish covenanters were secretly forming a union with the english parliament and incited the necessity of preventing them by some vigorous undertaking the latter still insisted that every such attempt would precipitate them into measures to which otherwise they were not perhaps inclined
8224-274381-0003	the king's ears were now open to montrous's counsels who proposed none but the boldest and most daring agreeably to the desperate state of the royal course in scotland
8224-274381-0004	five hundred men more who had been levied by the convoyers were persuaded to embrace the royal choice and with this combined force he hastened to attack lord elkoh who lay at purt with an army of six thousand men assembled upon the first news of the irish invasion
8224-274381-0005	reading the superior power of argyle who having joined his vassals to a force levied by the public was approaching with a considerably army montero hastened northward in order to rouse again the marquis of huntley and the gordon's who having before hastily taken arms had been instantly suppressed by the covensers
8224-274381-0006	this nobleman's character though celebrated for political courage and conduct was very low for military prowess and after some skirmishes in which he was wrested he here allowed montero's to escape him
8224-274381-0007	by quick marches through these inaccessible mountains that general freed himself from the superior forces of the covennants
8224-274381-0008	with these and some reinforcements of the athol men and montgomerys whom he had recalled montero fell suddenly upon argyle's country and let loose upon it all the rage of war carrying off the castle burning the houses and putting the inhabitants to the sword
8224-274381-0009	this severity by which monroe sullied his victories was the result of private animosity against the chief as much as of zeal for the public cause argyle collecting three thousand men marched in quest of the enemy who had retired with their plunder and he lay at interlaken supposing himself still at a considerable distance from them
8224-274381-0010	by a quick and unexpected march montero hastened to inerlochy and presented himself in order of battle before the surprised but not afrighted cavaliers
8224-274381-0011	his conduct and presence of mind in this emergency appeared conspicuous
8224-274381-0012	montrose weak in cavalry here lined his troops of horse with infantry and after putting the enemy's horse to rout fell with united force upon their foot who were entirely cut in pieces though with the loss of the gallant lord gordon on the part of the royists
8224-274381-0013	from the same men new regiments and new companies were formed different officers appointed and the whole military force put into such hands as the independence could rely on
8224-274381-0014	besides members of parliament who were excluded many officers unwilling to serve under the new generals threw up their commissions and unwarily facilitated the project of putting the army entirely into the hands of that faction
8224-274381-0015	though the discipline of the former parliamentary army was not contemptible a more exact plan was introduced and rigorously executed by these new commanders
8224-274381-0016	valor indeed was very generally diffused over the one party as well as the other during this period discipline also was attained by the forces of the parliament but the perfection of the military art in consorting the general plans of action and the operations of the field seems still on both sides to have been in a great measure wanting
8224-274381-0017	histories at least perhaps from their own ignorance and incompetence have not remarked anything but a headlong impetuous conduct each party hurrying to a battle where valor and fortune chiefly determined the success
4507-16021-0000	chapter one origin
4507-16021-0001	it engenders a whole world la pecheur for which red theft and a hell la pecheur for which red hunger
4507-16021-0002	thus idleness is the mother
4507-16021-0003	she has a son theft and a daughter hunger
4507-16021-0004	what is slang
4507-16021-0005	we have never understood this sort of objections
4507-16021-0006	slang is odious
4507-16021-0007	slang makes one shudder
4507-16021-0008	who denies that of course it does
4507-16021-0009	when it is a question of probbing a wound a gulf a society since when has it been considered wrong to go too far to go to the bottom
4507-16021-0010	we have always thought that it was sometimes a courageous act and at least a simple and useful deed worthy of the sympathetic attention which duty accepted and fulfilled merits
4507-16021-0011	why should one not explore everything and study everything
4507-16021-0012	why should one halt on the way
4507-16021-0013	nothing is more lugubrious than the contemplation thus in its nudity in the broad light of thought of the horrible swearing of slang
4507-16021-0014	now when has horror ever excluded study
4507-16021-0015	since when has malady banished medicine
4507-16021-0016	can one imagine a naturalist refusing to study the viper the bat the scorpion the centipede the tarantula and one who would cast them back into their darkness saying oh how ugly that is
4507-16021-0017	he would be like a philosopher refusing to examine a fact in language a philosopher hesitating to scrutinize a fact in humanity
4507-16021-0018	what is slang properly speaking
4507-16021-0019	it is the language of richness
4507-16021-0020	we may be stopped the fact may be put to us in general terms which is one way of attaining it we may be told that all trades professions it may be added all the accidents of the social hierarchy and all forms of intelligence have their own slang
4507-16021-0021	the painter who says my grinder the notary who says my mealy back the cobbler who says my cubby talk's slang
4507-16021-0022	there is the slang of the affected lady as well as of the purses
4507-16021-0023	the sugar manufacturer who says loaf claraified lumps bastard common burnt this honest manufactory talked slang
4507-16021-0024	algebra medicine botany have each there slang
4507-16021-0025	to meet the needs of this conflict richness has invented a language of combat which is slang
4507-16021-0026	to keep aloft and to rescue from oblivion to hold above the globe were it but a fragment of some language which man has spoken and which would otherwise be lost that is to say one of the elements good or bad of which it is composed to extend the records of social observation is to serve civilization itself
4507-16021-0027	fanacia very good
4507-16021-0028	even dialogue let that pass
4507-16021-0029	to this we reply in one word only
4507-16021-0030	assuredly if the tongue which a nation or a province has spoken is worthy of interest the language which has been spoken by a minority is still more worthy of attention and study
4507-16021-0031	and then we insist upon it the study of social deformities and infirmities and the task of pointing them out with a view to remedy is not a business in which choice is permitted
4507-16021-0032	he must descend with his heart full of charity and severity at the same time as a brother and as a judge to those who bleed and those who deal the blow those who weep and those who inflict it
4507-16021-0033	do we really know the mountain well when we are not acquainted with the cavern
4507-16021-0034	they constitute two different orders of facts which correspond to each other which are always interlaced and which often bring forth results
4507-16021-0035	true history being a mixture of all things the true historian mingles in everything
4507-16021-0036	facts form one of these and ideas the other
4507-16021-0037	there it closes itself in wired masks in metaphorical rags
4507-16021-0038	in this guise it becomes horrible
4507-16021-0039	one perceives without understanding it a hideous murmur sounding almost like human accents but more nearly resembling a howl than an articulate word
4507-16021-0040	one thinks one hears hydra talking
4507-16021-0041	it is unintelligible in the dark
4507-16021-0042	it is black in misfortune it is blacker still in crime these two blacknesses amalgamated compose slang
4507-16021-0043	the earth is not divided of resemblance to a jail
4507-16021-0044	look closely at life
4507-16021-0045	it is so made that everywhere we feel the sense of punishment
4507-16021-0046	each day has its own great grief for its little care
4507-16021-0047	yes day you were trembling for a health that is dear to you today you fear for your own to morrow the prevailing weather then the prevailing weather
4507-16021-0048	this without reckoning in the pains of the heart and so it goes on
4507-16021-0049	there is hardly one day out of a hundred which is wholly joyous and sunny
4507-16021-0050	and you belong to that small class you are happy
4507-16021-0051	in this world evidently the vestige of another there are no fortune
4507-16021-0052	the real human division is this the luminous and the shady
4507-16021-0053	to diminish the number of the shadi to augment the number of the luminous that is the object
4507-16021-0054	that is why we cry education science
4507-16021-0055	to teach reading means to light the fire every syllable spelled out sparks
4507-16021-0056	however he who says light does not necessarily say joy
4507-16021-0057	people suffer in the light excess burns
4507-16021-0058	the flame is the enemy of the wing
4507-16021-0059	to burn without ceasing to fly therein lies the marvel of genius
672-122797-0000	out in the woods stood a nice little fir tree
672-122797-0001	the place he had been a very good one the sun shone on him as to fresh air there was enough of that and round him grew many large sized comrades pines as well as firs
672-122797-0002	he did not think of the warm sun and of the fresh air he did not care for the little cottage children that ran about and prattled when they were in the woods looking for wild strawberries
672-122797-0003	but this was what the tree could not bear to hear
672-122797-0004	in winter when the snow lay glittering on the ground a hare would often come leaping along and jump right over the little tree
672-122797-0005	oh that made him so angry
672-122797-0006	to grow and grow to get older and be tall thought the tree that after all is the most delightful thing in the world
672-122797-0007	in autumn the wood cutters always came and fellled some of the largest trees
672-122797-0008	this happened every year and the young fir tree that had now grown to a very comely size trembled at the sight for the magnificent great trees fell to the earth with noise and cracking the branches were laid in carts and the horses dragged them out of the wood
672-122797-0009	have you not met them anywhere
672-122797-0010	rejoice in thy growth said the sunbeams
672-122797-0011	and then what happens then
672-122797-0012	i would fain know if i am destined for so glorious a career cried the tree rejoicing
672-122797-0013	i am now tall and my branches spread like the others that were carried off last year oh
672-122797-0014	were i but already on the cart
672-122797-0015	were i in the warm room with all the splendor and magnificence
672-122797-0016	yes then something better something still grander will surely follow or wherefore should they thus ornament me
672-122797-0017	something better something still grander must follow but what
672-122797-0018	rejoice in our presence said the air and the sunlight
672-122797-0019	rejoice in thy own fresh youth
672-122797-0020	but the tree did not rejoice at all he grew and grew and was green both winter and summer
672-122797-0021	and towards christmas he was one of the first that was cut down
672-122797-0022	the axe struck deep into the very pit the tree fell to the earth with a sigh he felt a pang it was like a swoon he could not think of happiness for he was sorrowful at being separated from his home from the place where he had sprung up
672-122797-0023	he well knew that he should never see his dear old comrades the little bushes and flowers around him any more perhaps not even the birds
672-122797-0024	the departure was not at all agreeable
672-122797-0025	the tree only came to himself when he was unloaded in a courtyard with the other trees and heard a man say that one is splendid we don't want the others
672-122797-0026	there too were large easy chairs silken sofas large tables full of picture books and full of toys worth hundreds and hundreds of crowns at least the children said so
672-122797-0027	the servants as well as the young ladies decorated it
672-122797-0028	this evening they all said
672-122797-0029	how it will shine this evening
672-122797-0030	perhaps the other trees from the forest will come to look at me
672-122797-0031	it blazed up famously help help
672-122797-0032	cried the young ladies and they quickly put out the fire
672-122797-0033	the story
672-122797-0034	the story cried the children drawing a little fat man towards the tree
672-122797-0035	but i shall tell only one story
672-122797-0036	humby donny fell downstairs and yet he married the princess
672-122797-0037	that's the way of the world
672-122797-0038	thought the fur tree and believed it all because the man who told the story was so good looking well well
672-122797-0039	i won't tremble to morrow thought the fur tree
672-122797-0040	and the whole night the tree stood still and in deep thought
672-122797-0041	in the morning the servant and the housemaid came in
672-122797-0042	but they dragged him out of the room and up the stairs into the loft and here in a dark corner where no daylight could enter they left him
672-122797-0043	what's the meaning of this thought the tree
672-122797-0044	and he leaned against the wall lost in reverie
672-122797-0045	time enough had he too for his reflections for days and nights past on and nobody came up and when at last somebody did come it was only to put some great trunks in a corner out of the way
672-122797-0046	there's now winter out of doors thought the tree
672-122797-0047	how kind man is after all
672-122797-0048	if it it only were not so dark here and so terribly lonely
672-122797-0049	skrik squeak
672-122797-0050	they snuffed about the fur tree and rustled among the branches
672-122797-0051	i am by no means old said the fur tree
672-122797-0052	there's many a one considerably older than i am
672-122797-0053	they were so extremely curious
672-122797-0054	i know no such place said the tree
672-122797-0055	and then he told all about his youth and the little mice had never heard the like before and they listened and said
672-122797-0056	said the fur tree thinking over what he had himself related
672-122797-0057	yes in reality those were happy times
672-122797-0058	oh isumpy dumpy asked the mice
672-122797-0059	only that one answered the tree
672-122797-0060	it is a very stupid story
672-122797-0061	don't you know one about bacon and tallow candles can't you tell any harder stories
672-122797-0062	now said the tree
672-122797-0063	then good bye said the rats and they went home
672-122797-0064	at last the little mice stayed away also and the tree sighed after all it was very pleasant when the sleek little mouse sat round me and listened to what i told them
672-122797-0065	now that too is over
672-122797-0066	while one morning there came a quantity of people and set to work in the loft
672-122797-0067	the trunks were moved the tree was pulled out and thrown rather hard it is true down on the floor but a man drew him toward the stairs where the daylight shone
672-122797-0068	but it was not the fur tree that they meant
672-122797-0069	it was in a corner that he lay among weeds and nettles
672-122797-0070	the golden star of tinsel was still on the top of the tree and glittered in the sunshine
672-122797-0071	in the courtyard some of the merric children were playing who had danced at christmas round the fir tree and were so glad at the sight of him
672-122797-0072	and the gardeners boy chopped the tree into small pieces there was a whole heap lying there
672-122797-0073	the wood flamed up splendidly under the large brewing cooper and it sided so deeply
672-122797-0074	however that was over now the tree gone the story at an end
5105-28241-0000	her seeing qualities were excellent and would have amply sufficed for a circumvallation of the globe
5105-28241-0001	after an apprenticeship on a merchant ship he had entered the imperial navy and had already reached the rank of lieutenant when the count appointed him to the charge of his own private yacht in which he was accustomed to spend by far the greater part of his time throughout the winter generally cruising in the mediterranean whilst in the summer he visited more northern waters
5105-28241-0002	the late astounding events however had rendered proko manfully uneasy and not the less so from his consciousness that the count secretly parted of his own anxiety
5105-28241-0003	steam up and canvas spread the schooner started eastward
5105-28241-0004	although only a moderate breeze was blowing the sea was rough a circumstance to be accounted for only by the diminution in the force of the earth's attraction rendering the liquid particles so buoyant that by the mere effect of oscillation they were carried to a height that was quite unprecedented
5105-28241-0005	for a few miles she followed the line hitherto presumably occupied by the coast of algeria but no land appeared to the south
5105-28241-0006	the log and the compass therefore were able to be called upon to do the work of the sextant which had become utterly useless
5105-28241-0007	there's no fear of that sir
5105-28241-0008	the earth has undoubtedly entered upon a new orbit but she is not encircling any probable risk of being precipitated on to the sun
5105-28241-0009	and what demonstration do you offer asked servadac eagerly that it will not happen
5105-28241-0010	option reigned supreme
5105-28241-0011	all the images of his past life floated upon his memory his thoughts sped away to his native france only to return again to wonder whether the depths of ocean would reveal any traces of the algerian metropolis
5105-28241-0012	is it not impossible he murmured aloud that any city should disappear so completely
5105-28241-0013	would not the loftiest eminences of the city at least be visible
5105-28241-0014	another circumstance was most remarkable
5105-28241-0015	to the surprise of all and especially of lieutenant proko the line indicated a bottom at a nearly uniform depth of from four to five feet and although the sounding was perspicuous in any degree to what would be expected over the site of a city that had been terrorized like the seats of an amphitheatre
5105-28241-0016	you must see lieutenant i should think that we are not so near the coast of algeria as you imagined
5105-28241-0017	after pondering a while he said if we were farther away i should expect to find a depth of two or three hundred fathoms instead of five fathoms five fathoms
5105-28241-0018	its depth remained irreversible still four or at most five fathoms and although its bottom was assiduously dredged it was only to prove it barren of marine production of any type
5105-28241-0019	nothing was to be done but to put about and return and disappointment toward the north
5105-28240-0000	fast as his legs could carry him servadak had made his way to the top of the cliff
5105-28240-0001	it was quite true that a vessel was in sight hardly more than six miles from the shore but owing to the increase in the earth's convexity and the consequent limitation of the range of vision the wringing of the top masts alone was visible above the water
5105-28240-0002	exclaimed servadak keeping his eye unmoved at his temple
5105-28240-0003	she is under seal but she is count timoshchev's yacht he was right
5105-28240-0004	if the count were on board a strange fatigue was bringing him to the presence of his rival
5105-28240-0005	he reckoned therefore not only upon asserting the extent of the late catastrophe but upon learning its cause
5105-28240-0006	the wind being avert the dobrina did not make very rapid progress but as the weather in spite of a few clouds remained calm and the sea was quite smooth she was enabled to hold a steady course
5105-28240-0007	servant took it forgotten that the debray was endeavoring to put in
5105-28240-0008	another channel formed a passage through the ridge of rocks that protected it from the open sea and which even in the roughest weather would ensure the calmness of its waters
5105-28240-0009	slightly changing her course she first struck her mane sail and in order to facilitate the movements of her helmsmen soon carried nothing but her two topsails brigantine and gib
5105-28240-0010	captain servard hastened toward him
5105-28240-0011	i left you on a continent and here i have the honor of finding you on an island
5105-28240-0012	never mind now interposed the captain we will talk of that by and bye
5105-28240-0013	nothing more than you know yourself
5105-28240-0014	are you certain that this is the mediterranean
5105-28240-0015	for some moments he seemed perfectly stupidified and then recovering himself he began to overwhelm the count with a torrent of questions
5105-28240-0016	to all these inquiries the count responded in the affirmative
5105-28240-0017	some mysterious force seemed to have brought about a convulsion of the elements
5105-28240-0018	you will take me on board count will you not
5105-28240-0019	my yah is at your service sir even should you require to make a tour around the world
5105-28240-0020	the count shook his head
5105-28240-0021	before starting it was indispensable that the engine of the debray should be repaired to sail under canvas only would in contrary winds and rough seas be both tedious and difficult
5105-28240-0022	it was on the last day of january that the repairs of the schooner were completed
5105-28240-0023	a slight diminution in the excessively high temperature which had prevailed for the last few weeks was the only apparent change in the general order of things but whether this was to be attributed to any alteration in the earth's orbit was a question which would still require several days to decide
5105-28240-0024	duits now arose and some discussion followed whether or not it was desirable for ben zuf to accompany his master
5105-28233-0000	length of service fourteen years three months and five days
5105-28233-0001	he seemed born to please without being conscious of the power he possessed
5105-28233-0002	it must be owned and no one was more ready to confess it than himself that his literary attainments were by no means of a high order
5105-28233-0003	we don't spin tops is a favorite saying amongst artillery officers indicating that they do not shirk their duty by frivolous pursuits but it must be confessed that servitude being naturally idle was very much given to spinning tops
5105-28233-0004	once in action he was leading a detachment of infantry through an entrenchment
5105-28233-0005	sometimes he would wander on foot upon the sandy shore and sometimes he would enjoy a ride along the summit of the cliff altogether being in no hurry at all to bring his task to an end
5105-28233-0006	now a cathedral not even burgess itself could vie with the church at montmartre
5105-28233-0007	benzos most ambitious desire was to induce the captain to go with him and end his days in his much loved home and so incessently were servadac's ears besieged with descriptions of the unparalleled beauties and advantages of this eighteenth arrondasment of paris that he could scarcely hear the name of montmartre without a conscious thrill of aversion
5105-28233-0008	when a private in the eighth cavalry he had been on the point of quitting the army at twenty eight years of age but unexpectedly he had been appointed officer to captain servadack
5105-28233-0009	the bond of union thus effected could never be severed and although ben zuf's achievements had fairly earned him the right of retirement he firmly declined all honors or any pension that might part him from his superior officer
5105-28233-0010	unlike his master he made no pretension to any gift of poetic power but his inexhaustible memory made him a living enigmatical and for his stalk of anecdotes and trooper tales he was matchless
3729-6852-0000	to celebrate the arrival of her son silvia gave a splendid supper to which she had invited all her relatives and it was a good opportunity for me to make their acquaintance
3729-6852-0001	without saying it positively she made me understand that being herself and illustrious member of the republic of letters she was well aware that she was speaking to an insult
3729-6852-0002	in order to please her i spoke to her of the abby cantey and i had occasion to quote two lines of that profound writer
3729-6852-0003	madame corrected me with a patronizing air for my pronunciation of the word skerova which means divided saying that it ought to be pronounced skerova and she added that i ought to be very glad to have learned so much on the first day of my arrival in paris telling me that it would be an important day in my life
3729-6852-0004	her face was an enigma for it inspired every one with the warmest sympathy and yet if you examined it attentively there was not one beautiful feature she could not be called handsome but no one could have thought her ugly
3729-6852-0005	celevia was the adoration of france and her talent was the real support of all the commodities which the greatest authors wrote for her especially of the plays of marius for without her his commodities would never have gone to prosperity
3729-6852-0006	celevia did not think that her good conduct was a merit for she knew that she was virtuous only because herself love compelled her to be so and she never exhibited any pride or assumed any superiority towards her theatrical sisters although satisfied to shine by their talent or their beauty they cared little about rendering themselves conspicuous by their virtue
3729-6852-0007	two years before her death i saw her perform the character of marianna in the comedy of meravio and in spite of her age and declining health the illusion was complete
3729-6852-0008	she was honorably buried in the church of saint savere without the slightest opposition from the venerable priest who far from sharing the anti christian intolerance of the clergy in general said that her profession as an actress had not hindered her from being a good christian and that the earth was a common mother of all human beings as jesus christ had been the saver of all mankind
3729-6852-0009	you will forgive me dear reader if i have made you attend the funeral of savina ten years before her death believe me i have no intention of performing a miracle you may console yourself with the idea that i shall spare you that unpleasant task when poor savina dies
3729-6852-0010	never had any family
3729-6852-0011	i had a name i believe in my young days but i have forgotten it since i have been in service
3729-6852-0012	i shall call you as spree
3729-6852-0013	you do me a great honor
3729-6852-0014	here go and get me changed for a louis i have it sir
3729-6852-0015	at your service sir
3729-6852-0016	madame quercourt besides can answer your inquiries
3729-6852-0017	i see a quantity of chairs for hire at the rate of one sou men reading the newspaper under the shade of the trees girls and men breakfasting either alone or in company waiters who were rapidly going up and down a narrow staircase hidden under the foliage
3729-6852-0018	i sit down at a small table a waiter comes immediately to inquire my wishes
3729-6852-0019	i tell him to give me some coffee if it is good
3729-6852-0020	then turning towards me he says that i look like a foreigner and when i say that i am italian he begins to speak to me of the coast the city of the theatres and at last he offers to accompany me everywhere
3729-6852-0021	i thank him and take my leave
3729-6852-0022	i address him in italian and he answers very wittily but his way of speaking makes me smile and i tell him why
3729-6852-0023	my remark pleases him but i soon prove to him that it is not the right way to speak however perfect may have been the language of that ancient writer
3729-6852-0024	i see a crowd in one corner of the garden everybody standing still and looking up
3729-6852-0025	is there not a miradian everywhere
3729-6852-0026	yes but the miradian of the palais royale is the most exact
3729-6852-0027	that is true badaultrey
3729-6852-0028	all these honest persons are waiting their turn to get their snuff boxes filled
3729-6852-0029	it is sold everywhere but for the last three weeks nobody will use any stuff but that sole at the savet cat
3729-6852-0030	is it better than anywhere else
3729-6852-0031	but how did she manage to render it so fashionable
3729-6852-0032	simply by stopping her carriage two or three times before the shop to have her snuff box filled and by saying aloud to the young girl who handed back the box that her snuff was the very best in paris
3729-6852-0033	you are now in the only country in the world where wit can make a fortune by selling either a genuine or a false article in the first case it receives the welcome of intelligence of the people here and however wonderful it may appear silliness is the daughter of wit
3729-6852-0034	let a man run and everybody will run after him the crowd will not stop unless the man is proved to be mad but to prove it is indeed a difficult task because we have a crowd of men who mad from their birth are still considered wise
3729-6852-0035	it seems to me i replied that such approval such rapture of the opinion expressed by the king the princes of the blood et cetera is rather a proof of the affection felt for them by the nation for the french carry that affection to such an extent that they believe them infallible
3729-6852-0036	when the king comes to paris everybody calls out vive le roi
3729-6852-0037	she introduced me to all her guests and gave me some particulars respecting every one of them
3729-6852-0038	what sir i said to him am i fortunate enough to see you
3729-6852-0039	he himself recited the same passage in french and politely pointed out the parts in which he thought that i had improved on the original
3729-6852-0040	for the first day sir i think that what you have done gives great hopes of you and without any doubt you will make rapid progress
3729-6852-0041	i believe it sir and that is what i fear therefore the principal object of my visit here is to devote myself entirely to the study of the french language
3729-6852-0042	i am a very unpleasant pupil always asking questions curious troublesome insatiable and even supposing that i could meet with the teacher i require i am afraid i am not rich enough to pay him
3729-6852-0043	i resided in the marseilles rue de duesport
3729-6852-0044	i will make you translate them into french and you need not be afraid of my finding you insatiable
3729-6852-0045	he had a good appetite could tell a good story without laughing was celebrated for his witty rapartes and his respectable manners but he spent his life at home seldom going out and seeing hardly any one because he always had a pipe in his mouth and was surrounded by at least twenty cats with which he would amuse himself all day
3729-6852-0046	his housekeeper had the management of everything she never allowed him to be in need of anything and she gave no account of his money which she kept altogether because he never asked her to render any accounts
1089-134691-0000	he could wait no longer
1089-134691-0001	for a full hour he had paced up and down waiting but he could wait no longer
1089-134691-0002	he set off abruptly for the bull walking rapidly lest his father's shrill whistle might call him back and in a few moments he had rounded the curve at the police barricade and was safe
1089-134691-0003	the unity
1089-134691-0004	pride after satisfaction uplifted him like long slow waves
1089-134691-0005	whose feet are as the feet of hearts and underneath the everlasting arms
1089-134691-0006	the pride of that dim image brought back to his mind the dignity of the office he had refused
1089-134691-0007	soon the whole bridge was trembling and resounding
1089-134691-0008	the uncouth faces past him two by two stained yellow or red or livid by the sea and as he strove to look at them with ease and indifference a faint stain of personal shame and commiseration rose to his own face
1089-134691-0009	angry with himself he tried to hide his face from their eyes by gazing down sideways into the shallow swirling water under the bridge but he still saw a reflection therein of their top heavy silk hats and humble tape like collars and loosely hanging clerical clothes brother hicky
1089-134691-0010	brother macardel brother kiough
1089-134691-0011	their pity would be like their names like their faces like their clothes and it was idle for him to tell himself that their humble and contrite hearts it might be paid a far richer tribute of devotion than his had ever been a gift tenfold more acceptable than his elaborate adoration
1089-134691-0012	it was idle for him to move himself to be generous towards them to tell himself that if he ever came to their gates stripped of his pride beaten and in beggars weeds that they would be generous towards him loving him as themselves
1089-134691-0013	idle and embittering finally to argue against his own dispassionate sentiment that the command of love bade us not to love our neighbor as ourselves with the same amount and intensity of love but to love him as ourselves with the same kind of love
1089-134691-0014	the phrase and the day and the scene harmonized in accord
1089-134691-0015	words was it their colors
1089-134691-0016	they were voyaging across the deserts of the sky a host of no mads on the march voyaging high over ireland westward bound
1089-134691-0017	the europe they had come from lay out there beyond the irish sea europe of strange tongues and vaunted and would begirt and sittied and of entrenched and marshalled races
1089-134691-0018	again again
1089-134691-0019	a voice from beyond the world was calling
1089-134691-0020	hello stephanos here comes the dedalus
1089-134691-0021	their diving stone poised on its rude supports and rocking under their plunges and the rough hewn stones of the sloping breakwater over which they scrambled in their horseplay gleamed with cold wet luster
1089-134691-0022	he stood still in deference to their calls and parried their banter with easy words
1089-134691-0023	it was a pain to see them and a sword like pain to see the signs of addiction that made repentant their pitiable nakedness
1089-134691-0024	stephanos derlos
1089-134691-0025	moment before the ghost of the ancient kingdom of the deanes had looked forth through the vestige of the haze wrapped city
1089-134686-0000	he hoped there would be stew for dinner turnips and carrots and bruised potatoes and fat mutton pieces to be ladled out in thick peppered flour fat sauce
1089-134686-0001	stuff it into you his belly counseled him
1089-134686-0002	after early nightfall the yellow lamps would light up here and there the solitary quarter of the brawths
1089-134686-0003	hello burty any good in your mind
1089-134686-0004	numbers ten fresh nelly is waiting on you good night husband
1089-134686-0005	the music came nearer and he recalled the words the words of shelly's fragment upon the moon wandering companionless pale for weariness
1089-134686-0006	the dull light fell more faintly upon the page whereon another equation began to unfold itself slowly and to spread abroad its widening tail
1089-134686-0007	a cold lucid indifference reigned in his soul
1089-134686-0008	the caesar in which his ardor extinguished itself was a cold indifferent knowledge of himself
1089-134686-0009	at most by an alms given to a beggar whose blessing he fled from he might hope wearily to win for himself some measure of actual grace
1089-134686-0010	well now ensign i declare you have a head and so has my stick
1089-134686-0011	on saturday mornings when the soda factory met in the chapel to recite the little office his place was a cushioned kneeling desk at the right of the altar from which he led his wing of boys through the responses
1089-134686-0012	her eyes seemed to regard him with mild pity her holiness a strange light glowing faintly upon her frail flesh did not humble the senior who approached her
1089-134686-0013	if ever he was impelled to cast sin from him and to repent the impulse that moved him was the wish to be her night
1089-134686-0014	he tried to think how it could be
1089-134686-0015	but the dusk deepening in the school room covered over his thoughts the bell rang
1089-134686-0016	then you can ask him questions on the catastrophe dedalus
1089-134686-0017	stephen leaning back and drawing idly on his scribbler listened to the talk about him which harron checked from time to time by saying
1089-134686-0018	it was strange too that he found an arid pleasure following up to the end the rigid lines of the doctors of the church and pertaining into obscure silences only to hear and feel the more deeply his own condemnation
1089-134686-0019	the sentence of saint james's which says that he who affends against one commandment becomes guilty of all had seemed to him first a swollen phrase until he had begun to grope in the darkness of his own state
1089-134686-0020	if a man had stolen a pound in his youth and had used that pound to amass a huge fortune how much was he obliged to give back the pound he had stolen only or the pound together with the compound interest accruing upon it or all his huge fortune
1089-134686-0021	if a lamb in giving baptism pour the water before saying the words is the child baptized
1089-134686-0022	how comes it that while the first beatitude promises the kingdom of heaven to the poor of heart the second beatitude promises also to the meek that they shall possess the land
1089-134686-0023	why was the sacrifice of the eucoris intended under the two species of bread and wine if jesus christ be present body and blood sole and divinity in the bread alone and in the wine alone
1089-134686-0024	if the wine change into vinegar and the host crumble into corruption after they have been consecrated is jesus christ still present under their species as god and as man
1089-134686-0025	gentle kick from the tall boy in the bench behind urged stephen to ask a difficult question
1089-134686-0026	the reader did not ask for a catalog to hear the lesson from
1089-134686-0027	he clasped his hands on the desk and said
1089-134686-0028	the retreat will begin on wednesday afternoon in honor of saint francis zavvier whose feast day is saturday
1089-134686-0029	on friday confession will be heard all the afternoon after beards
1089-134686-0030	be aware of making that mistake
1089-134686-0031	stephen's heart began slowly to fold and fade with fear like a withering flower
1089-134686-0032	he has called as you know the apostle of the indies
1089-134686-0033	a great saint saint francis zavvier
1089-134686-0034	the reader paused and then shaking his clasped hands before him went on
1089-134686-0035	he had the faith in him that moves mountains
1089-134686-0036	a great saint saint francis zavier
1089-134686-0037	in the silence their dark fire kindled the dusk into a tawny glow
1188-133604-0000	you will find me continually speaking of four men tithon holbein turner and tintoret in almost the same terms
1188-133604-0001	they unite every quality and sometimes you will find me referring to them as colorists sometimes as chemists
1188-133604-0002	by being stupid of color they are stupid of division and while the curiosist devotes himself to the representation of degrees of force in one thing unseparated light the colonists have for their faction the attainment of beauty by arrangement of the divisions of light
1188-133604-0003	my first principal reason was that they enforced beyond all resistance on any student who might attempt to copy them this method of laying portions of distinct hue side by side
1188-133604-0004	some of the touches indeed when the tint has been mixed with much water have been laid in little drops or ponds so that the pigment might crystallize hard at the edge
1188-133604-0005	it is the head of a parasite with a little flower in his beak from a picture of carpotyza one of his series of the life of saint george
1188-133604-0006	then he comes to the beak of it
1188-133604-0007	the brown ground beneath is left for the most part one touch of black is put for the hollow two delicate lines of dark gray define the outer curve and one little quivering touch of white draws the inner edge of the mandible
1188-133604-0008	for believe me the final philosophy of art can only rattle their opinion that the beauty of a cock robin is to be read and the best skill of art is instantly ceasing on the manifold dishonesty of light which you can only seize by prescription of instantaneous touch
1188-133604-0009	now you will see in these studies that the moment the white is enclosed properly and harmonized with the other hues it becomes somehow more precious and purly than the white paper and that i am not afraid to leave a whole field of untried white paper will tell as jewels if they are gratuated justly
1188-133604-0010	but in this veniat copied from turner you have the two principles brought out perfectly
1188-133604-0011	they are beyond all other works than i know existing dependent for their effect on low subdued tones their favorite choice in time of day being either dawn or twilight and even their brightest subsets produced chiefly out of gray paper
1188-133604-0012	it may be that a great colorist will use his utmost force of color as a singer his full power of voice but loud or low the virtue is in both cases always in refinement never in loudness
1188-133604-0013	it must remember be one or the other
1188-133604-0014	do not therefore think that the gothic school's and easy one
1188-133604-0015	the law of that school is that everything shall be seen clearly or at least only in such mist or faintness as shall be delightful and i have no doubt that the best introduction to it would be the elementary practice of painting every study on a golden ground
1188-133604-0016	this at once compels you to understand that the work is to be imaginative and decorative that it represents beautiful things in the clearest way but not under existing conditions and that fact fact fact
1188-133604-0017	that a style is restrained or severe does not mean that it is also ornate
1188-133604-0018	in all early gothic art indeed you will find failure of this kind especially distortion and rigidity which are in many respects painfully to be compared with the splendid pose of classic art
1188-133604-0019	the large letter contains indeed entirely feeble and ill drawn figures that is merely childish and failing work of an inferior hand it is not characteristic of gothic or any other school
1188-133604-0020	but observe you can only do this on one condition that of striving also to create in reality the beauty which you seek imagination
1188-133604-0021	it will be wholly impossible for you to retain the tranquillity of temper and facility of faith necessary for noble purist painting unless you are actively engaged in promoting the felicity and peace of practical life
1188-133604-0022	you must look at him in the face fight him conquer him with what scathe you may you need not think to keep out of the way of him
1188-133604-0023	the colorist says first of all as my delicious parquet was ruby so this nasty viper shall be black and then is the question can i round him off even though he is black and make him sly me and yet springing and close down cloned like a pool of black blood on the earth all the same
1188-133604-0024	nothing will be more precious to you i think in the practical study of art than the conviction which will force itself on you more and more every hour of the way all things are bound together little and great spirit and in matter
1188-133604-0025	you know i have just been telling you how this school of materialism and clay involved itself at last and cloud and fire
1188-133604-0026	here is an equally typical greek school landscape by wilson lost wholly and golden mists the trees so slightly drawn that you don't know if they are trees or towers and no care for color whatever perfectly decisive and marvelous effect of sunshine through the mist a hollow and the pythone
1188-133604-0027	now here is raffael exactly between the two trees still drawn leaf by leaf wholly formal but beautiful mist coming gradually into the distance
1188-133604-0028	well then last here is turners greek school of the highest class and you define his art absolutely as first the displaying intensely and with the sternest intellect of natural form as it is and then the envelopment of it with cloud and fire
1188-133604-0029	only there are two sorts of cloud and fire
1188-133604-0030	he knows them both
1188-133604-0031	there's one and there's another the dudley and the flint
1188-133604-0032	it is only a pencil outline by edward barnes and illustration of the story of psyche it is the introduction of psychology after all her troubles into heaven
1188-133604-0033	every plant in the grass is set formally grows perfectly and may be realized completely
1188-133604-0034	exquisite order and universal with eternal life and light this is the faith and effort of the schools of christel and you may describe and complete their work quite literally by taking any verses of chaucer in his tender mood and observing how he insists on the clearness and brightness first and then on the order
1188-133604-0035	thus in chaucer's dream
1188-133604-0036	in both these high mythical subjects the surrounding nature though suffering is still dignified and beautiful
1188-133604-0037	every line in which the master traces it even where seemingly negligent is lovely and set down with a meditative calmness which makes these two etchings capable of being placed beside the most tranquil work of holbein or du r
1188-133604-0038	but now here is a subject of which you will wonder at first why turner drew it at all
1188-133604-0039	it has no beauty whatsoever no species of picturicness and all its lines are cramped and poor
1188-133604-0040	the crampness and the poverty are all intended
1188-133604-0041	it is a gleaner bringing down her one sheet of corn to an old water mill it itself mossy and rent scarcely able to get its stones to turn
1188-133604-0042	the scene is absolutely orcadian
1188-133604-0043	see that your lives be in nothing worse than a boy's climbing for his entangled kite
1188-133604-0044	it will be well for you if you join not with those who instead of knights fly falcons who instead of obedience the last words of the great cloud shepherd to feed his sheep live the lives how much less than vanity of the war wolf and the year eagle
2300-131720-0000	the paris plant like that at the christel palace was a temporary exhibit
2300-131720-0001	the london plant was less temporary but not permanent supplying before it was torn out no fewer than three thousand lamps in hotels churches stores and dwellings in the vicinity of holborn viaduct
2300-131720-0002	there messrs johnson and hamre put into practice many of the ideas now standard in the art and secured much useful data for the work in new york of which the story has just been told
2300-131720-0003	the dynamo electric machine though small was robust for under all the varying speeds of water power and the vicissitudes of the plant to which it belonged it continued in active use until eighteen ninety nine seventeen years
2300-131720-0004	owing to his insistence on low pressure direct current for use in densely populated districts as the only safe and truly universal profitable way of delivering electrical energy to the consumers edison has been frequently spoken of as an opponent of the alternating current
2300-131720-0005	why if we erect a station at the falls it is a great economy to get it up to the city
2300-131720-0006	there seems no good reason for believing that it will change
2300-131720-0007	backward as the prayers and free and thought as the winds that swept them he is ego sensitrically opposed to loose and wasteful methods to plans of empire that neglect the poor at the gate
2300-131720-0008	every thing he has done has been aimed at the conservation of energy the contraction of space the entrapment of culture
2300-131720-0009	for some years it was not found feasible to operate motors on alternating current circuits and that reason was often urged against it seriously
2300-131720-0010	it could not be used for electroplating or deposition nor could it charge storage batteries all of which are easily within the ability of the direct current
2300-131720-0011	but when it came to be a question of lighting a scattered suburb a group of dwellings on the outskirts a remote country residence or a farm house the alternating current in all elements save its danger was and is ideal
2300-131720-0012	edison was intelligent of sham and shaw and nothing would satisfy him that could not stand cross examination by microscope test tube and galvanometer
2300-131720-0013	unless he could secure an engine of smoother running and more exactly governed and regulated than those available for his diploma and lamp edison realized that he would find it almost impossible to give a steady light
2300-131720-0014	master edison was a leader far ahead of the time
2300-131720-0015	he obtained the desired speed and load with a friction brake also regulator of speed but waited for an indicator to verify it
2300-131720-0016	then again there was no known way to lubricate an engine for continuous running and mister edison informed me that as a merrick engine started before the ship left new york and continued running until it reached its home port so an engineer for his purposes must produce light at all times
2300-131720-0017	edison had installed his historic first grade central station system in new york on the multiple arc system covered by his feeder and main invention which resulted in a notable saving in the cost of conductors as against a straight two wire system through out of the tree kind
2300-131720-0018	he soon foresaw that still greater economy would be necessary for commercial success not alone for the larger territory opening but for the compact district of large cities
2300-131720-0019	the strong position held by the edison system under the strident competition that was already springing up was enormously improved by the introduction of the three wire system and it gave an immediate impetus to incandescent lighting
2300-131720-0020	it was specially suited for a trial plant also in the early days when a yield of six or eight lamps to the horse power was considered subject for congratulation
2300-131720-0021	the street conductors were of the overhead pole line construction and were installed by the construction company that had been organized by edison to build and equip central stations
2300-131720-0022	meanwhile he had called upon me to make a report of the three war system known in england as the hopkinson both doctor john hopkinson and mister edison being independent inventors at practically the same time
2300-131720-0023	think he was perhaps more appreciative that i was of the discipline of the edison construction department and thought it would be well for us to wait until the morning of the fourth before we started up
2300-131720-0024	but the plant ran and it was the first three year station in this country
2300-131720-0025	they were later used as reserve machines and finally with the engine retired from service as part of the coalition of eosonia but they remain in practically as good condition as when installed in eighteen eighty three
2300-131720-0026	the armpit installed outside a customer's premises or in a circuit for public street lighting burned so many hours nightly so many nights in the month and was paid for at that rate subject to rebait for hours when the lamp might be out through accident
2300-131720-0027	edison held that the electricity sold must be measured just like gas or water and he proceeded to develop a meter
2300-131720-0028	there were infinite scepticism around him on the subject and while other inventors were also giving the subject their thought the public took it for granted that anything so utterable as electricity that could not be seen or waded and only gave secondary evidence of itself at the exact point of use could not be brought to accurate registration
2300-131720-0029	once the asteroid electric meter is no longer used despite its excellent qualities
2300-131720-0030	the principal employed in the edition electric meter is that which exemplifies the power of electricity to decompose a chemical substance
2300-131720-0031	associated with this simple form of apparatus were various ingenious details and refinements to secure regularity of operation freedom from inaccuracy and immunity from such tampering as would permit theft of current or damage
2300-131720-0032	the standard edition meter practice was to remove the cells once a month to the meter room of the central station company for examination another set being substituted
2300-131720-0033	in december eighteen eighty eight mister david jeanks read an interesting paper before the american institute of electrical engineers on the six years of practical experience had up to that time with the meter then more generally in use than any other
2300-131720-0034	the others having been in operation too short a time to show definite results although they also went quickly to a dividend basis
2300-131720-0035	in this connection it should be mentioned that the association of edison illuminating companies in the same year adopted resolutions unanimously to the effect that the edison meter was accurate and that its use was not expensive for stations above one thousand lights and that the best financial results were invariably secured in a station selling current by meter
2300-131720-0036	the mediator continued in general service during eighteen ninety nine and probably up to the close of the century
2300-131720-0037	he weighed and re weighed the meter plates and pursued every line of investigation imaginable but all in vain
2300-131720-0038	he felt he was up against it and that perhaps another kind of a job would suit him better
2300-131720-0039	the problem was solved
2300-131720-0040	we were more interested in the technical condition of the station than in the commercial part
2300-131720-0041	we had medders in which there were two bottles of liquid
6829-68769-0000	henry and beth reigned from telling the other girls or uncle john of old will roger's visit but they got mister watson in the library and questioned him closely about the penalty for forging a check
6829-68769-0001	it was a serious crime indeed mister watson told them and tom gates bade fare to serve a lengthier term in the states prison as a consequence of his rash act
6829-68769-0002	i can't see it in that light said the old lawyer
6829-68769-0003	it was a deliberate theft from his employers to protect a girl he loved
6829-68769-0004	but they could not have prevented a case against lucy if she was innocent and all their threats of arresting her were properly a mere bluff
6829-68769-0005	he was soft hearted and impetuous said beth and being in love he didn't stop to count the cost
6829-68769-0006	if the prosecution were withdrawn and the case settled with the victim of the forged check then the young man would be allowed his freedom
6829-68769-0007	but under the circumstances i doubt if such an arrangement could be made
6829-68769-0008	farve was twelve miles away but by ten o'clock they drew up at the county drail
6829-68769-0009	they were received in the little office by a man named markham who was the jailer
6829-68769-0010	we wished to talk with him answered kenneth talk
6829-68769-0011	im running for representative on the republican ticket said kenneth quietly
6829-68769-0012	oh say that's different observed markham altering his demeanor
6829-68769-0013	may be gates at once asked kenneth
6829-68769-0014	they followed the jailor along a succession of passages
6829-68769-0015	sometimes i'm that yearning for a smoke i'm nearly crazy and i don't know which is worse dying one way or another
6829-68769-0016	he unlocked the door and called here's visitors tom
6829-68769-0017	worst tom worse than ever replied the jailer gloomily
6829-68769-0018	master graft said kenneth noticing the boy's face critically as he stood where the light from the passage fell upon it
6829-68769-0019	sorry we haven't any reception room in the jail
6829-68769-0020	cut down please said gates in a cheerful and pleasant voice there's a bench here
6829-68769-0021	a fresh handsome looking boy was tom gates with steady gray eyes an intelligent forehead but a sensitive rather weak mouth
6829-68769-0022	we have heard something of your story said kenneth and are interested in it
6829-68769-0023	i didn't stop to think whether it was foolish or not i did it and i'm glad i did it
6829-68769-0024	old will is a fine fellow but poor and helpless since missus rogers had her accident
6829-68769-0025	then rodgers wouldn't do anything but lead her around and wait a moment and the place went to rack and ruin
6829-68769-0026	he spoke simply but paced up and down the narrow cell in front of them
6829-68769-0027	whose name did you sign to the check asked kenneth
6829-68769-0028	he is supposed to sign all the checks of the concern
6829-68769-0029	it's a stock company and rich
6829-68769-0030	i was bitten keeper so it was easy to get a blank check and forge the signature
6829-68769-0031	as regards my robbing the company i'll say that i saved him a heavy loss one day
6829-68769-0032	i discovered and put out a fire that would have destroyed the whole plant but martill never even thanked me
6829-68769-0033	it was better for him to think the girl unfeeling than to know the truth
6829-68769-0034	im going to see mister marshall said kenneth and discover what i can do to assist you thank you sir
6829-68769-0035	it won't be much but i'm grateful to find a friend
6829-68769-0036	they left him then for the jail arrived to unlock the door and escort them to the office
6829-68769-0037	i've seen lots of that kind in my day
6829-68769-0038	and it ruins a man's disposition
6829-68769-0039	he looked up rather ungraciously but motioned them to be seated
6829-68769-0040	some girl has been in here twice to interview my men and i have refused to admit her
6829-68769-0041	im not electioneering just now
6829-68769-0042	oh well sir what about em
6829-68769-0043	and he deserves a term in states prison
6829-68769-0044	it has cost me twice sixty dollars in annoyance
6829-68769-0045	ill pay all the cost besides
6829-68769-0046	you are foolish why should you do all this
6829-68769-0047	i have my own reasons mister marshall
6829-68769-0048	give me a check for a hundred and fifty and i'll turn over to you the forge check and quash further proceedings
6829-68769-0049	he detested the grasping disposition that would endeavor to take advantage of his evident desire to help young gates
6829-68769-0050	beth uneasy at a silence nudged him
6829-68769-0051	there was a grim smile of amusement on his shrewd face
6829-68769-0052	he might have had that forge check for the face of it if he'd been sharp
6829-68769-0053	and to think we can save all that misery and despair by the payment of a hundred and fifty dollars
6829-68771-0000	so to the surprise of the democratic committee and all his friends mister hopkins announced that he would oppose forbes aggressive campaign with an equal aggressiveness and spend as many dollars in doing so as might be necessary
6829-68771-0001	one of mister hopkins's first tasks after calling his faithful henchman around him was to make a careful canvass of the voters of his district to see what was still to be accomplished
6829-68771-0002	the weak need contingency must be strengthened and fortified and a couple of hundred votes in one way or the other secured from opposition
6829-68771-0003	the democratic committee figured out a way to do this
6829-68771-0004	under ordinary conditions renels was sure to be elected but the committee proposed to sacrifice him in order to elect hopkins
6829-68771-0005	the only thing necessary was to fix set reins and this hopkins arranged personally
6829-68771-0006	and this was why kenneth and beth discovered him conversing with the young woman in the buggy
6829-68771-0007	the description she gave of the coming reception to the women political league was so humorous and diverting that they were both laughing heartily over the thing when the young people passed them and thus mister hopkins failed to notice who the occupant of the other vehicle were
6829-68771-0008	these women were flattered by the attention of the young lady and had promised to assist in establishing mister forbes
6829-68771-0009	loise hoped for excellent results from this organization and wished the entertainment to be so offensive in winning their good will that they would work earnestly for the cause in which they were enlisted
6829-68771-0010	the fair view band was engaged to discourse as much harmony as it could produce and the resources of the great house were taxed to entertain the guests
6829-68771-0011	tables were spread on the lawn and a dainty but substantial repast was to be served
6829-68771-0012	this was the first occasion within a generation when such an entertainment had been given at elmhurst and the only when within the memory of man where the neighbors and country people had been the invited guests
6829-68771-0013	the attendance was unexpectedly large and the girls were delighted for seeing great success for their fight
6829-68771-0014	we ought to have more attendance beth said louise approaching her cousin
6829-68771-0015	won't you run into the house and see if martha can't spare one or two more mates
6829-68771-0016	she was very fond of the young ladies whom she had known when aunt jane was their mistress here and beth was her especial favorite
6829-68771-0017	the housekeeper led the way and beth followed
6829-68771-0018	for a moment beth stood staring while the new maid regarded her with composure and a slight smile upon her beautiful face
6829-68771-0019	she was dressed in the regulation costume of the maids at elmhurst a plain black gown with a white apron and cap
6829-68771-0020	then she gave a little laugh and replied no miss beth i'm elizabeth parsons
6829-68771-0021	but it can't be protested the girl
6829-68771-0022	i attend to the household mending you know and care for the linen
6829-68771-0023	you speak like an educated person said beth wonderingly where is your home
6829-68771-0024	for the first time the maid seemed a little confused and her gaze wandered from the face of her visitor
6829-68771-0025	she sat down in a rocking chair and clasping her hands in her lap rocked slowly back and forth i'm sorry said beth
6829-68771-0026	alice parsons shook her head
6829-68771-0027	they they excite me in some way and i can't bear them you must excuse me
6829-68771-0028	she even seemed mildly amused at the attention she attracted
6829-68771-0029	beth was a beautiful girl the handsomest of the three cousins by far yet eliza surpassed her in natural charm and seemed well aware of the fact
6829-68771-0030	her manner was neither independent nor assertive but rather one of well bred composure and calm reliability
6829-68771-0031	her eyes wandered to the mate's hands
6829-68771-0032	however her features and form might repress any evidence of nervousness these hands told a different story
6829-68771-0033	she rose quickly to her feet with an impetuous gesture that made her visitor catch her breath
6829-68771-0034	i wish i knew myself she cried fiercely
6829-68771-0035	will you leave me alone in my own room or must i go away to escape you
6829-68771-0036	alice closed the door behind her with a decided slam and a key clicked in the lock
1580-141083-0000	i will endeavor in my statement to avoid such terms as would serve to limit the events to any particular place or give a clew as to the people concerned
1580-141083-0001	i had always known him to be restless in his manner but on this particular occasion he was in such a state of uncontrollable agitation that it clear something very unusual had occurred
1580-141083-0002	my friend's temper had not improved since he had been deprived of the congenial surroundings of baker street
1580-141083-0003	without his scrap books his chemicals and his homely untidiness he was an uncomfortable man
1580-141083-0004	i had to read it over carefully as the text must be absolutely correct
1580-141083-0005	i was absent rather more than an hour
1580-141083-0006	the only duplicate which existed so far as i knew was that which belonged to my servant banister a man who has looked after my room for ten years and whose honesty is absolutely above suspicion
1580-141083-0007	the moment i looked at my table i was aware that some one had rummaged among my papers
1580-141083-0008	the proof was in three long slips i had left them all together
1580-141083-0009	the alternative was that some one passing had observed the key in the door had known that i was out and had entered to look at the papers
1580-141083-0010	i gave him a little brandy and left him collapsed in a chair while i made a most careful examination of the room
1580-141083-0011	a broken tip of lead was lying there also
1580-141083-0012	not only this but on the table i found a small bowl of black dough or clay with specks of something which looked like sawdust in it
1580-141083-0013	above all things i desire to settle the matter quietly and discreetly
1580-141083-0014	to the best of my belief they were rolled up
1580-141083-0015	did any one know that these proofs would be there no one save the printer
1580-141083-0016	i was in such a hurry to come to you you left your door open
1580-141083-0017	so it seems to me
1580-141083-0018	now mister somes at your disposal
1580-141083-0019	above were three students one on each story
1580-141083-0020	then he approached it and standing on tiptoe with his neck craned he looked into the room
1580-141083-0021	there is no opening except the one pane said our learned guide
1580-141083-0022	i am afraid there are no signs here said he
1580-141083-0023	one could hardly hope for any upon so dry a day
1580-141083-0024	you left him in a chair you say which chair by the window there
1580-141083-0025	the man entered and took the papers sheet by sheet from the central table
1580-141083-0026	as a matter of fact he could not said somes for i entered by the side door
1580-141083-0027	how long would it take him to do that using every possible contraction a quarter of an hour not less
1580-141083-0028	then he tossed it down and seized the neck
1580-141083-0029	he was in the midst of that when your return caused him to make a very hurried retreat very hurried since he had not time to replace the papers which would tell you that he had been there
1580-141083-0030	master sams was somewhat overwhelmed by this flood of information
1580-141083-0031	hom's held out a small chip with the letters n n and a space of clear wood after them you see
1580-141083-0032	weston i have always done you an injustice there are others
1580-141083-0033	i was hoping that if the paper on which he wrote was thin some trace of it might come through upon this polished surface no i see nothing
1580-141083-0034	as home drew the curtain i was aware from some little rigidity and an alertness of his attitude that he was prepared for an emergency
1580-141083-0035	hamsters turned away and stooped suddenly to the floor hola what is this
1580-141083-0036	hom's held it out on his open palm in the glare of the electric light
1580-141083-0037	what could he do he caught up everything which would betray him and he rushed into your bedroom to conceal himself
1580-141083-0038	i understand you to say that there are three students who use this stair and are in the habit of passing your door yes there are
1580-141083-0039	and they are all in for this examination yes
1580-141083-0040	one hardly likes to throw suspicion where there are no proofs
1580-141083-0041	let us hear the suspensions i will look after the proofs
1580-141083-0042	my sister has been left very poor but he is hard working and industrious he will do well
1580-141083-0043	the top floor belongs to malcolm mc claren
1580-141083-0044	i dare not go so far as that but of the three he is perhaps the least unlikely
1580-141083-0045	he was still suffering from this sudden disturbance of the quiet routine of his life
1580-141083-0046	but i have occasionally done the same thing at other times
1580-141083-0047	did you look at these papers on the table
1580-141083-0048	how came you to leave the key in the door
1580-141083-0049	anyone in the room could get out yes sir
1580-141083-0050	i really don't think he knew much about it mister homes
1580-141083-0051	only for a minute or so
1580-141083-0052	oh i would not venture to say sir
1580-141083-0053	you haven't seen any of them no sir
1580-141084-0000	it was the indian whose dark silhouette appeared suddenly upon his blind
1580-141084-0001	he was pacing swiftly up and down his room
1580-141084-0002	the set of rooms is quite the oldest in the college and it is not unusual for visitors to go over them
1580-141084-0003	now names please said homes as we knocked at gil crisp's door
1580-141084-0004	of course he did not realize that it was i who was knocking but nevertheless his conduct was very uncourteous and indeed under the circumstances rather suspicious
1580-141084-0005	that is very important said homes
1580-141084-0006	you don't seem to realize the position
1580-141084-0007	to morrow is the examination
1580-141084-0008	i cannot allow the examination to be held if one of the papers has been tampered with the situation must be faced
1580-141084-0009	it is possible that i may be in a position then to indicate some course of action
1580-141084-0010	i will take the black clay with me also the pencil cuttings good bye
1580-141084-0011	when we were out in the darkness of the quadangle we again looked up at the windows
1580-141084-0012	the foul mouthed fellow at the top
1580-141084-0013	he is the one with the worst record
1580-141084-0014	why banister the servant what's his game in the matter
1580-141084-0015	he impressed me as being a perfectly honest man
1580-141084-0016	my friend did not appear to be depressed by his failure but shrugged his shoulders and half humorous resignation
1580-141084-0017	now good my dear watson
1580-141084-0018	i think so you have formed a conclusion
1580-141084-0019	yes my dear watson i have solved the mystery
1580-141084-0020	look at that he held out his hand
1580-141084-0021	on the palm were three little pyramids of black dewy clay
1580-141084-0022	and one more this morning
1580-141084-0023	in a few hours the examination would commence and he was still in the dilemma between making the facts public and allowing the culprit to complete for the valuable scholarship
1580-141084-0024	he could hardly stand still so great was his mental agitation and he ran toward homes with two eager hands outstretched thank heaven that you have come
1580-141084-0025	you know him i think so
1580-141084-0026	if this matter is not to become public we must give ourselves certain powers and resolve ourselves into a small private cartel
1580-141084-0027	now sir certainly not
1580-141084-0028	there was no man sir
1580-141084-0029	his troubled blue eyes glanced at each of us and finally rested with an expression of blank dismay upon banister in the farther corner
1580-141084-0030	just close the door said homes
1580-141084-0031	we want to know mister gluckrist how you an honorable man ever came to commit such an action as that of yesterday
1580-141084-0032	for a moment gil crisp with outraged hand tried to control his writhing features
1580-141084-0033	come come said homers kindly it is human to air and at least no one can accuse you of being a careless criminal
1580-141084-0034	well don't trouble to answer listen and see that i do you no injustice
1580-141084-0035	he could examine the papers in his own office
1580-141084-0036	the indian i also thought nothing of
1580-141084-0037	when i approached your room i examined the window
1580-141084-0038	now one less than that would have a chance
1580-141084-0039	i entered and i took you into my confidence as to the suggestions of the side table
1580-141084-0040	he returned carrying his jumping shoes which are provided as you are there with several sharp spikes
1580-141084-0041	now harm would have been done had it not been that as he passed your door he perceived the key which had been left by the carelessness of your servant
1580-141084-0042	a sudden impulse came over him to enter and see if they were indeed the primes
1580-141084-0043	he put his shoes on the table
1580-141084-0044	 Gloves said the young man
1580-141084-0045	uddenly he heard him at the very door there was no possible escape
1580-141084-0046	have i told the truth mister gilcrest
1580-141084-0047	i have a letter here mister somes which i wrote to you early this morning in the middle of a restless night
1580-141084-0048	it will be clear to you from what i have said that only you could have let this young man out since you were left in the room and must have locked the door when you went out
1580-141084-0049	it was simple enough sir if you only had known but with all your cleverness it was impossible that you could know
1580-141084-0050	if mister somes saw them the game was up
4970-29095-0000	she was tired of other things
4970-29095-0001	she tried this morning an air or two upon the piano sang a simple song in a sweet but slightly metallic voice and then seating herself by the open window read philip's letter
4970-29095-0002	well mother said the young student looking up with a shade of impatience
4970-29095-0003	i hope thee told the elders that father and i are responsible for the piano and that much as thee loves music thee is never in the room when it is played
4970-29095-0004	i heard father tell cousin abner that he was whipped so often for whistling when he was a boy that he was determined to have what compensation he could get now
4970-29095-0005	thy ways greatly try me ruth and all thy relations
4970-29095-0006	is thy father willing thee should go away to a school of the world's people
4970-29095-0007	i have not asked him ruth replied with a look that might imply that she was one of those determined little bodies who first made up her own mind and then compelled others to make up theirs in accordance with hers
4970-29095-0008	mother i am going to study medicine
4970-29095-0009	marcourt bulton almost lost for a moment her habitual politeness
4970-29095-0010	the study medicine
4970-29095-0011	does thee think thee could stand it six months
4970-29095-0012	and besides suppose dee does learn medicine
4970-29095-0013	i will practice it
4970-29095-0014	where thee and thy family are known
4970-29095-0015	if i can get patience
4970-29095-0016	 ruth sat quite still for a time with face intent and flushed it was out now
4970-29095-0017	the sightseers returned in high spirits from the city
4970-29095-0018	 ruth asked the enthusiasts if they would like to live in such a sounding moselyam with its great halls and echoing rooms and no comfortable place in it for the accommodation of any body
4970-29095-0019	and then there was broad street
4970-29095-0020	there certainly was no end to it and even ruth was philadelphia enough to believe that a street ought not to have any end or architectural point upon which the weary eye could rest
4970-29095-0021	but neither saint derard nor broad street neither wonders of the mint nor the galleries of the hall were the ghosts of our fathers sit always signing the declaration impressed the visitors so much as the splendors of the chestnut street windows and the bargons on eighth street
4970-29095-0022	is thee going to the yearly meeting ruth asked one of the girls
4970-29095-0023	i have nothing to wear replied that demure person
4970-29095-0024	it has occupied mother a long time to find at the shops the exact shade for her new bonnet
4970-29095-0025	and thee won't go why should i
4970-29095-0026	if i go to meeting at all i like best to sit in the quiet old house in german town where the windows are all open and i can see the trees and hear the stir of the leaves
4970-29095-0027	it's such a crush at the yearly meeting at arch street and then there's the row of sleek looking young men who lie in the curbstone and stare at us as we come out
4970-29095-0028	he doesn't say but it's on the frontier and on the map everything beyond it is marked indians and desert and looks as desolate as a wilderness meeting humph it was time for him to do something
4970-29095-0029	is he going to start a daily newspaper among the kickapoos
4970-29095-0030	father these aren't unjust to philip he's going into business
4970-29095-0031	he doesn't say exactly what it is said ruth a little dubiously but it's something about land and railways and the knows father that fortunes are made nobody knows exactly how in a new country
4970-29095-0032	but philip is honest and he has talent enough if he will stop scrabbling to make his way
4970-29095-0033	what a box women are put into measured for it and put in young if we go anywhere it's in a box veiled and pinioned and shut in by disabilities
4970-29095-0034	why should i rust and be stupid and sit in an action because i am a girl
4970-29095-0035	and if i had a fortune would thee want me to lead a useless life
4970-29095-0036	has thee consulted thy mother about a career i suppose it is a career of thee wants
4970-29095-0037	but that wise and patient woman understood the sweet rebel a great deal better than ruth understood herself
4970-29095-0038	 ruth was glad to hear that philip had made a push into the world and she was sure that his talent and courage would make a way for him
4970-29093-0000	you'll never dig it out of the asteroid library
4970-29093-0001	to the young american here or elsewhere the paths to fortune are innumerable and all open there is invitation in the air and success in all his wide horizon
4970-29093-0002	he has no traditions to bind him or guide him and his impulse is to break away from the occupation his father has followed and make a new way for himself
4970-29093-0003	the modest fellow would have liked fame thrust upon him for some worthy achievement it might be for a book or for the skillful management of some great newspaper or for some daring expedition like that of lieutenant strane or doctor cane
4970-29093-0004	he was unable to decide exactly what it should be
4970-29093-0005	sometimes he thought he would like to stand in a conspicuous pulpit and humbly preach the gospel of repentance and it even crossed his mind that it would be noble to give himself to a missionary life to some banished region where the daub palm groves and the nightingale's voice is in tune and the bulbule sings on the umbrellas
4970-29093-0006	law seemed to him well enough as a science but he never could discover a practical case where it appeared to him worth while to go to law and all the clients who stopped with this new clerk in the army who knew that justice between man and man could only be attained by the recognized processes with the attendant fees
4970-29093-0007	it is such a noble ambition that it is a pity it has usually such a shallow foundation
4970-29093-0008	he wanted to begin at the top of the ladder
4970-29093-0009	philip therefore read diligently in the asterbury library planned literary works that should compel attention and nursed his genius
4970-29093-0010	he had no friend wise enough to tell him to step into the docking convention then in session make a sketch of the men and women on the platform and take it to the editor of the daily grapevine and see what he could get a line for it
4970-29093-0011	oh very well said gringo turning away with a shade of contempt you'll find if you are going into literature and newspaper work that you can't afford a conscience like that
4970-29093-0012	but philip did afford it and he wrote thanking his friends and declining because he said the political scheme would fail and ought to fail
4970-29093-0013	and he went back to his books and to his waiting for an opening large enough for his dignified entrance into the literary world
4970-29093-0014	well i'm going as an engineer you could go as one
4970-29093-0015	you can begin by caring a rod and putting down the figures
4970-29093-0016	now it's not too soon
4970-29093-0017	i've been ready to go anywhere for six months
4970-29093-0018	the two young men who were by this time full of the adventure went down to the walnut office of henry's uncle and had a talk with that wily operator
4970-29093-0019	the night was spent in packing up and writing letters for philip would not take such an important step without informing his friends
4970-29093-0020	why it's in misery somewhere on the frontier i think we'll get a map
4970-29093-0021	was afraid it was nearer home
4970-29093-0022	he knew his uncle would be glad to hear that he had at last turned his thoughts to a practical matter
4970-29093-0023	he well knew the pearls of the frontier the savage state of society the lurking indians and the dangers of fever
4992-41797-0000	yes dead these four years and a good job for her too
4992-41797-0001	well as i say it's an awful queer world they clap all the burglars in jail and the murderers and the wives of the peace and what not and yet the law has nothing to say to a man like han lourd
4992-41797-0002	grandfather was alexander cary e l e d i doctor of laws that is
4992-41797-0003	master popom laid down his brush
4992-41797-0004	i swain to man he ejaculated if you don't work hard you can't keep up with the times doctor of laws
4992-41797-0005	don he ain't done a thing he ordered since he was born
4992-41797-0006	he keeps the thou shalt not commandements first rate hen lord does
4992-41797-0007	he gave up his position and shut the family up in that tomb of a house so and he could study his books
4992-41797-0008	master popom exaggerated nothing but on the contrary left much unsaid in his narrative of the family at the house of lords
4992-41797-0009	henry lorne with the degree of pythagor to his credit had been professor of zoology at a new england college but had resigned his post in order to write a series of scientific texts
4992-41797-0010	always irritating cold indifferent he had grown rapidly more so as years went on
4992-41797-0011	whatever appeal to her sense of beauty was straightway transferred to paper or canvas
4992-41797-0012	she is wild to know how to do things
4992-41797-0013	she makes effort after effort trembling with eagerness and when she fails to re reproduce what she sees she works herself into a frenzy of grief and disappointment
4992-41797-0014	when she could not make a rabbit or a bird look real on paper she searched in her father's books for pictures of its bones
4992-41797-0015	serial there must be some better way of doing i just draw the outline of an animal and then i put hairs or feathers on it they have no bodies
4992-41797-0016	they couldn't run or move there just paceboard
4992-41797-0017	he wouldn't search so don't worry replied sarole quietly and the two looked at each other and knew that it was so
4992-41797-0018	there in the cedar hollow then lived olive lawn an angry resentful little creature weighed down by a fierce sense of injury
4992-41797-0019	all of us its mournful black eyes met nancy's sparkling brown ones
4992-41797-0020	rance's curly chestnut crop shone in the sun and olive's thick black plates looked blacker by contrast
4992-41797-0021	she is wonderful more wonderful than any body we've ever seen anywhere and she draws better than the teacher in charles town
4992-41797-0022	she's older than i am but so tiny and sad and shy that she seems like a child
4992-23283-0000	but the more forgiveness had then prevailed the more powerful was the force of remembrance when she awoke
4992-23283-0001	miss millner's health is not good
4992-23283-0002	said missus horton a few minutes afterwards
4992-23283-0003	so there is to me added sampered with a sarcastic sneer
4992-23283-0004	and yet you must own her behavior has warranted them has it not been in this particular incorrigible and unaccountable
4992-23283-0005	not that i know of not one more than i know of he replied with astonishment at what she had insinuated and yet with a perfect assurance that she was in the wrong
4992-23283-0006	perhaps i am mistaken answered she
4992-23283-0007	to ask any more questions of you i believe would be unfair
4992-23283-0008	he seemed to wait for her reply but as she made none he proceeded
4992-23283-0009	oh my lord cried miss willey with a most forcible accent you are the last person on earth she would pardon me for intrusting
4992-23283-0010	but in such a case miss miller's election of a husband shall not direct mine
4992-23283-0011	if she does not know how to estimate her own value i do
4992-23283-0012	independent of her fortune she has beauty to captivate the heart of any man and with all her follies she has a frankness in her manner an unaffected wisdom in her thoughts a vivacity in her conversation and with all a softness in her demeanor that might alone engage the affections of a man of the nicest sentiments and the strongest understanding
4992-23283-0013	my lord miss miller's taste is not a depraved one it is but two refined
4992-23283-0014	what can you mean by that miss wadley you talk mysteriously
4992-23283-0015	is she not afraid that i will thwart her inclinations
4992-23283-0016	again he searched his own thoughts nor ineffably as before
4992-23283-0017	miss wadley was too little versed in the subject to know this would have been not to love at all at least not to the extent of breaking through engagements and all the various obstacles that still mitigated against their union
4992-23283-0018	to relieve her from both he laid his hand with force upon his heart and said do you believe me
4992-23283-0019	i will make no unjust use of what i know he replied with firmness i believe you my lord
4992-23283-0020	i have never yet however been vanquished by them and even upon this occasion my reason shall combat them to the last and my reason shall fail me before i do wrong
4992-41806-0000	natal harriman tried the kitchen pump secretly several times during the evening for the water had to run uphill all the way from the well to the kitchen sink and he believed this to be a continual miracle that might give out at any moment
4992-41806-0001	to night there was no need of extra heat and there were great ceremonies to be observed in lighting the fires on the hearth stones
4992-41806-0002	they began with the one in the family sitting room colonel wheeler routherton mister and missus bill harriman with natty and ruth thurston mister and missus popom with digby and lally joy all standing in admiring groups and thrilling with delight at the order of events
4992-41806-0003	castle waved the torch two and fro as she recited some beautiful lines written for some such purpose as that which called them together to night
4992-41806-0004	burn fire burn flicker flicker flame
4992-41806-0005	next came olive's turn to help in the ceremonies
4992-41806-0006	raw thurton had found a line of latitude for them and his beloved horace Tibby splendidocus for you the fourth signs
4992-41806-0007	oliver had painted the motto on a long narrow panel of canvas and giving it to mister popom stood by the fireplace while he deftly fitted it into the place prepared for it
4992-41806-0008	olave has another lovely gift for the yellow house said mother carey rising and to carry out the next part of the program we shall have to go in procession upstairs to my bedroom
4992-41806-0009	exclaimed bill harron to his wife as they went through the lighted hall
4992-41806-0010	ain't they the greatest
4992-41806-0011	mother carry poured coffee nancy chocolate and the others help serve the sandwiches and cake donuts and tartlets
4992-41806-0012	at that moment the gentleman entered bearing a huge object concealed by a piece of green felt
4992-41806-0013	approaching the dining table he carefully placed the article in the center and removed the cloth
4992-41806-0014	think again to myself i never seen anything ash popmunk wouldn't mend if he took time enough and glue enough so i carried this little fellow home in a basket one night last month and i've spent eleven evenings putting him together
4992-41806-0015	missus harmon thought he sang too much and told her husband privately that if he was a canary bird she should want to keep a table cover over his head most of the time but he was immensely popular with the rest of his audience
4992-41806-0016	the face of the mohogany shone with delight and why not when it was doing everything almost everything within the scope of a piano and yet the family had enjoyed weeks of good nourishing meals on what had been saved by its exertions
4992-41806-0017	we shut our eyes the flowers bloom on we murmur but the coroniers fill we choose the shadow but the sun that cast it shines behind us still
61-70968-0000	he began a confused complaint against the wizard who had vanished behind the curtain on the left
61-70968-0001	give not so earnest a mind to these murmuries child
61-70968-0002	a golden fortune and a happy life
61-70968-0003	he was like unto my father in a way and yet was not my father
61-70968-0004	also there was a stripping page who turned into a maid
61-70968-0005	this was so sweet a lady sir and in some manner i do think she died
61-70968-0006	but then the picture was gone as quickly as it came
61-70968-0007	ister nell do you hear these marvels
61-70968-0008	take your place and let us see what the crystal can show to you
61-70968-0009	like as not young master though i am an old man
61-70968-0010	forthwith all ran to the opening of the tent to see what might be amiss but master will who peeped out first needed no more than one glance
61-70968-0011	he gave way to the others very readily and retreated unseen by the sire and mistress phithouth to the rear of the tent
61-70968-0012	cries of anatame a notching
61-70968-0013	before them fled the stroller and his three sons capricious and terrified
61-70968-0014	what is the tumult and rioting cried out the sire authoritatively and he blew twice on the silver whistle which hung at his belt
61-70968-0015	neay we refuse there request most politely most noble said the little stroller
61-70968-0016	and then they became vexed and would have snatched your purse from us
61-70968-0017	i could not see my boy injured excellence for but doing his duty as one of cumberland sons
61-70968-0018	so i did push this fellow
61-70968-0019	it is enough said george game well sharply as he turned upon the crowd
61-70968-0020	shame on you citizens cried he i blush for my fellows of nottingham
61-70968-0021	surely we can submit with good grace
61-70968-0022	that's fine for you to talk old man answered the lean solid apprentice
61-70968-0023	but i wrestled with this fellow and do know that he played unfairly in the second bout
61-70968-0024	spoke the square losing all patience and it was to you that i gave another person consolation
61-70968-0025	come to me men here here he raised his voice still louder
61-70968-0026	the stewards took their part in it with hardy zest now that they had some chance of beating off their foes
61-70968-0027	rob and the little tumbler between them tried to force the sire to stand back and very valiantly did these two complement themselves
61-70968-0028	the head and cheek of the rite the nodding ham apprentice with clenched fists threatened monsieur
61-70968-0029	the square helped to thrust them all in and entered swiftly himself
61-70968-0030	now be silent on your lives he began but the captured prince set up an instant shout
61-70968-0031	 silence you naive cried monte cris
61-70968-0032	he felt for and found the wisest black cloth the square was quite out of breath
61-70968-0033	 thrusting open the proper entrance of the tent robin suddenly rushed forth with his burden with a great shout
61-70968-0034	amortifashay amuntifashay game well to the rescue
61-70968-0035	taking advantage of this the squire's few men redoubled their efforts and encouraged by robins and the little strawlers cried fought there way to him
61-70968-0036	george montfort will never forget this day
61-70968-0037	what is your name lording asked the little stroller presently
61-70968-0038	robbin fitzooth
61-70968-0039	and mine is will stewart shall we be comrades
61-70968-0040	right willingly for between us we have won the battle answered robin
61-70968-0041	i like you will you are the second will that i have met and liked within two days is there a sign in that
61-70968-0042	montfitchet called out for robin to give him an arm
61-70968-0043	friends said montfort fleetingly to the rusters bear us escort so far as the sheriff's house
61-70968-0044	it will not be safe for you to stay here now
61-70968-0045	pray follow us with mine and my lord sheriff's men
61-70968-0046	naughtham castle was reached and admittance was demanded
61-70968-0047	master monsieur the sheriff of naughton was mildly put about when told of the rioting
61-70968-0048	and henry might return to england at any moment
61-70968-0049	have your will child if the boy also wilts it monsieur answered feeling too ill to oppose anything very strongly just then
61-70968-0050	he made an effort to hide his condition from them all and robin felt his fingers tighten upon his arm
61-70968-0051	bag me a room of the sheriff child quickly
61-70968-0052	but who is this fellow plucking at your sleeve
61-70968-0053	he is my escort excellence returned robin with dignity
61-70968-0054	 mistress fitz duft had been carried off by the sheriff's daughter and her maids as soon as they had entered the house so that robin alone had the care of monte frisca
61-70968-0055	robin was glad when at length they were left to their own devices
61-70968-0056	the wind did certainly bring back the color to the square's cheeks
61-70968-0057	these escapades are not for old game well lad his day has come to twilight
61-70968-0058	will you forgive me now
61-70968-0059	it'll be no disappointment to me
61-70968-0060	no thanks i am glad to give you such easy happiness
61-70968-0061	you are a worthy leech will presently whispered robin the wine has worked a marvel
61-70968-0062	eye and show you some pretty tricks
61-70970-0000	young fitz udo had been commanded to his mother's chamber so soon as he had come out from his converse with the sire
61-70970-0001	there befell an anxious interview mistress phithou arguing for and against the squire's project in a breath
61-70970-0002	most of all robin thought of his father what would he counsel
61-70970-0003	if for a whim you beggar yourself i cannot stay you
61-70970-0004	but take it whilst i live and where monsieur scheuch's shield in the days when my eyes can be rejoice by so brave a sight for you will never disgrace our dutch i warrant me
61-70970-0005	the lad had checked him then
61-70970-0006	never that sir he had said
61-70970-0007	he was in deep converse with the clerk and entered the hall holding him by the arm
61-70970-0008	now to bed boy
61-70970-0009	til late and i go myself within a short space
61-70970-0010	dismiss your squire robin and bid me good even
61-70970-0011	as any in england i would say said gamwell proudly that is in his day
61-70970-0012	yet he will teach you a few tricks when morning is come
61-70970-0013	there was no chance to alter his sleeping room to one nearer to ganville's chamber
61-70970-0014	presently he crossed the floor of his room with decided step
61-70970-0015	will cried he softly and stutley who had chosen his couch across the door of his young master's chamber sprang up at once in answer
61-70970-0016	we will go out together to the bower there is a way down to the court from my window
61-70970-0017	rest and be still until i warn you
61-70970-0018	the hours passed wearily by and movement could yet be heard about the hall
61-70970-0019	at last all was quiet and black in the courtyard of gainewell
61-70970-0020	will whispered robin opening his door as he spoke are you ready
61-70970-0021	they then renewed their duty and under the better light made a safe crossing of the stable roofs
61-70970-0022	robin entered the hut dragging the unwilling escort after him
61-70970-0023	be not so foolish friend said phyturus crossly
61-70970-0024	they moved thereafter cautiously about the hut grooping before and about them to find something to show that warrington had fulfilled his mission
61-70970-0025	they were upon the verge of an open trap in the far corner of the hut and stutley had tripped over the edge of the reversed flat mouth of this pit
61-70970-0026	fitz soothe's hand rested at last upon the top rug of a ladder and slowly the truth came to him
61-70970-0027	robin carefully descended the ladder and found himself soon upon firm rocky ground
61-70970-0028	studley was by his side in a flash and then they both began feeling about them to ascertain the shape and character of this vault
61-70970-0029	from the brightness behind the light they heard a voice warrentons
61-70970-0030	save me masters but you startled me rarely
61-70970-0031	cried he waving the lantern before him to make sure that these were no ghosts in front of him
61-70970-0032	enquired robin with his suspicions still upon him
61-70970-0033	truly such a horse would be worth much in naughton fair
61-70970-0034	neigh neigh lodging answered worrenton with a half laugh
61-70970-0035	warrent spoke thus with significance to show robin that he was not to think jerry's claims to the estate would be passed by
61-70970-0036	robin fitzooth saw that his doubts of warrenton had been unfared and he became ashamed of himself for harboring them
61-70970-0037	his tones rang pleasantly on warrenton's ears and forthwith a good fellowship was heralded between them
61-70970-0038	the old servant told him quietly as they crept back to gainwell that this passage led from the hut in the vicinity to sherwood and that jeffrey for the time was hiding with the outlines in the forest
61-70970-0039	he implores us to be discreet as the grave in this matter for insight his life is in the hollow of our hands
61-70970-0040	they regained their apartment apparently without disturbing the household of gainewell
8555-292519-0000	brighter than early dawn's most brilliant dye are blown clear banks of color through the sky that swirl and sweep and meet to break and foam like rainbow veils upon a bubble's dome
8555-292519-0001	guided by you how we might stroll toward death our only music one another's breath through gardens intimate with honeyhocks where silent poppies burned between the rocks by pools where birches bend to confidants above green waters skimed with lily plants
8555-292519-0002	venus
8555-292519-0003	in a sunset glowing of crimson and gold she lies the glory of the world a beached king's gallly whose sails are furled who is hung with tapisseries rich and old
8555-292519-0004	the pity that we must come and go
8555-292519-0005	while the old gold and the marble stairs forever gleaming its soft strong blaze calm in the early evening glow
8555-292519-0006	the present graveyard of my sole with sentimental skyscraper trees and flowers is filled that i may stroll in meditation at my ease
8555-292519-0007	it is my heart hung in the sky and no clouds ever float between the grave flowers and my heart on high
8555-292519-0008	over the track lined city street the young man the grinning man pass
8555-292519-0009	oh ye sails that seemed to wander in dream filled meadows say is this shore where i stand the only field of struggle or are ye hit and battered out there by waves and wind gusts as ye tack over a clashing sea of watery echoes
8555-292519-0010	old dances are simplified of their yearning bleached by time
8555-292519-0011	he had got into her courtyard
8555-292519-0012	through the black night rain he sang to her window bars
8555-292519-0013	that was but rustling of dripping planes in the dark
8555-292519-0014	she was alone that night
8555-292519-0015	he had broken into her courtyard
8555-284447-0000	then he rushed downstairs into the courtyard shouting loudly for his soldiers and threatening to pitch every body in his dominions that the salmon was not recovered
8555-284447-0001	hold him fast my men and as soon as i've had my coffee and oatmeal i'll take him to the room of the great knife and patch him
8555-284447-0002	i wouldn't mind a cup of coffee myself said cap'n bill i have had a considerable exercise this morning and i am already ready for breakfast
8555-284447-0003	but capburn made no such attempt knowing it would be useless
8555-284447-0004	as soon as they entered the room of the great knight the buccaneer gave a yell of disappointment
8555-284447-0005	the room of the great knife was high and big and around it ran rows of benches for the spectators to sit upon
8555-284447-0006	in one place at the head of the room was a raised platform for the royal family with elegant throne chairs for the king and queen and six smaller but richly ornamented chairs for the snooze princesses
8555-284447-0007	therefore her majesty paid no attention to any one and no one paid any attention to her
8555-284447-0008	rich jewels of blue stones glittered upon their persons and the royal ladies were fully as courageous as they were haughty and overcoming
8555-284447-0009	morning girls hope you feel as well as you look
8555-284447-0010	controll yourself my dears replied the buccaneer the worst punishment i know how to inflict on any one this prisoner is about to suffer you will see a very pretty patching my royal daughters
8555-284447-0011	suppose it's a friend
8555-284447-0012	the captain shook his head
8555-284447-0013	why you set to fetch the first living creature we met and that was the spighygoat replied the captain panting hard as he held fast to one of the goat's horns
8555-284447-0014	the idea of patching cat bill to a goat was vastly amusing to him and the more he thought of it the more he roared with laughter
8555-284447-0015	they look something alike you know suggested the captain of the guards looking from one to the other doubtfully and they're nearly the same size if you stand the goat on his hind legs they've both got the same style of whiskers and they're both of them obstinate and dangerous so they ought to make a good patch splendid
8555-284447-0016	fine glorious
8555-284447-0017	when this had been accomplished the buccaneer leaned over to try to discover why the frame rolled away seemingly of its own accord and he was the more puzzled because it had never done such a thing before
8555-284447-0018	at once the goat gave a leap escaped from the soldiers and with bowed head rushed upon the buccaneer
8555-284447-0019	before any could stop him he budted his majesty so furiously that the king soared far into the air and tumbled in a heap among the benches where he lay moaning and groaning
8555-284447-0020	the goats warlike spirit was roused by this successful attack
8555-284447-0021	then they sped in great haste for the door and the goat gave a final butt that sent the row of royal ladies all diving into the corridor in another tunnel whereupon they shrieked in a manner that terrified everyone within sound of their voices
8555-284447-0022	i had a notion it was you mate save me from the knife
8555-284447-0023	i couldn't shiver much being bound so tight but when i'm loose i mean to have just one good shiver to relieve my feelings
8555-284447-0024	come and get the bullalo she said going toward the benches
8555-284449-0000	so they were quite willing to obey the orders of their girl queen and in a short time the blast of trumpets and roll of drums and clashing of cymbals told trot and captain bill that the blue bands had assembled before the palace
8555-284449-0001	then they all marched out a little way into the fields and found that the army of pinkies had already formed and was advancing steadily toward them
8555-284449-0002	at the head of the pinkies were grip gissel and buton bright who had the parasite on his shoulder and they were supplied by captain corlley and captain tinnet and rosalie the witch
8555-284449-0003	when the blue skins saw gippiszel they raised another great shout for he was the favorite of the soldiers and very popular with all the people
8555-284449-0004	since last thursday i gip gissel have been the lawful buccaneer of the blue country but now that you are conquered by queen trought i suppose i am conquered too and you have no buccaneer at all
8555-284449-0005	when he finished she said cheerfully
8555-284449-0006	don't worry sylvie dear it'll all come right pretty soon
8555-284449-0007	now then let's enter the city and enjoy the great feast that's being cooked i'm nearly starved myself for this congregating kingdoms is hard work
8555-284449-0008	then she gave rosalie back her magic ring thanking the kind witch for all she had done for them
8555-284449-0009	you are mate replied the sailor
8555-284449-0010	it will be such a satisfaction
8555-284449-0011	the guards had a terrible struggle with the goat which was loose in the room and still wanted to fight but finally they subdued the animal and then they took the bullaroo out of the frame whose tie end and brought both him and the goat before queen trot who awaited them in the throne room of the palace
8555-284449-0012	ill gladly do that promised the new buccaneer and i'll feed the honorable goat all the shavings and leather and tin cans he can eat besides the grass
8555-284449-0013	excuse me said tart i neglect to tell you that you are not the buccaneer any more
8555-284449-0014	the former buccaneer groaned
8555-284449-0015	he'll not be wicked any more sighed the old buccaneer i'll reform
8555-284449-0016	as a private citizen i shall be a model of department because it would be dangerous to be otherwise
8555-284449-0017	when first they entered the throne room they tried to be as haughty and scornful as ever but the blues who were assembled there all laughed at them and jeered them for there was not a single person in all the blue country who loved the princesses the least little bit
8555-284449-0018	so gipsy ordered the captain to take a file of soldiers and escort the ravaging beauties to their new home
8555-284449-0019	that evening trot gave a grand ball in the palace to which the most important of the pinkies and the blue skins were invited
8555-284449-0020	the combined bands of both the countries played the music and a fine supper was served
237-134500-0000	frank read english slowly and the more he read about this divorce case the angrier he grew
237-134500-0001	mary sighed
237-134500-0002	brisk wind had come up and was driving puffy white clouds across the sky
237-134500-0003	the orchard was sparkling and rippling in the sun
237-134500-0004	that invitation decided her
237-134500-0005	oh but i'm glad to get this place mowed
237-134500-0006	just smell the wild roses they are always so spicy after a rain
237-134500-0007	we never had so many of them in here before
237-134500-0008	i suppose it's the wet season will you have to cut them too
237-134500-0009	i suppose that's the wet season too then
237-134500-0010	it's exciting to see everything growing so fast and to get the grass cut
237-134500-0011	aren't you splashed look at the spider webs all over the grass
237-134500-0012	in a few moments he heard the cheers dropping smartly into the pale and he began to swing his sword with that long even stroke that few american boys ever learned
237-134500-0013	mary picked cherries and sang softly to herself stripping one glittering branch after another shivering when she caught a shower of raindrops on her neck and hair
237-134500-0014	and amelia moved his way slowly down toward the cherry trees
237-134500-0015	that summer the rains had been so many and opportunune that it was almost more than chabotta and his man could do to keep up with the corn the orchard was a neglected wilderness
237-134500-0016	don't know all of them but i know lyndon's are
237-134500-0017	if i feel that way i feel that way
237-134500-0018	he reached up among the branches and began to pick the sweet insipid fruit long ivory colored berries tipped with faint pencil like white coral that fell to the ground unhewn all summer through
237-134500-0019	he dropped a handful into her lap
237-134500-0020	yes don't you
237-134500-0021	oh ever so much only he seems kind of stayed and school teacher
237-134500-0022	when she used to tell me about him i always wondered whether she wasn't a little in love with him
237-134500-0023	it would serve you all right if she walked off with carol
237-134500-0024	i like to talk to carl about new york and what a fellow can do there
237-134500-0025	oh amil
237-134500-0026	surely you are not thinking of going off there
237-134500-0027	mary's face fell under his brooding gaze
237-134500-0028	im sure alexander hopes you will stay on here she murmured
237-134500-0029	don't you want to stand around and look on
237-134500-0030	i want to be doing something on my own account
237-134500-0031	sometimes i don't want to do anything at all and sometimes i want to pull the four corners of the divide together he threw out his arm and brought it back with a jerk so like a tablecloth
237-134500-0032	i get tired of seeing men and horses going up and down up and down
237-134500-0033	i wish you weren't so restless and didn't get so worked up over things she said sadly
237-134500-0034	thank you he returned shortly
237-134500-0035	and you never use to be cross to me
237-134500-0036	i can't play with you like a little boy any more he said slowly that's what you miss mirie
237-134500-0037	but amil if i understand then all our good times are over we can never do nice things together any more
237-134500-0038	and anyway there's nothing too understand
237-134500-0039	that won't last it will go away and things will be just as they used to be
237-134500-0040	pray for you but that's not the same as if you prayed yourself
237-134500-0041	i can't pray to have the things i want he said slowly and i won't pray not to have them not if i'm damned for it
237-134500-0042	than all our good times are over
237-134493-0000	it is sixteen years since john burgess died
237-134493-0001	his wife now lies beside him and the white shaft that marks their graves gleams across the wheat fields
237-134493-0002	from the norwegian graveyard one looks out over a vast checkerboard marked off in squares of wheat and corn light and dark dark and light and dark dark and light and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark and dark
237-134493-0003	from the graveyard gate one can count a dozen gaily painted farms the gilded weathered on the big red barns wink at each other across the green and brown and yellow fields
237-134493-0004	the air and the earth are curiously mated and intermingled as if the one were the breath of the other
237-134493-0005	he was a splendid figure of a boy tall and straight as a young pine tree with a handsome head and stormy gray eyes deeply set under a serious brow
237-134493-0006	that's not much of a job for an athlete here i've been to town and back
237-134493-0007	alexander let you sleep late
237-134493-0008	she gathered up her reins
237-134493-0009	please wait for me merrick amelia coached
237-134493-0010	i never see lose sight over here
237-134493-0011	how brown you've got since you came home i wish i had an athlete to mow my orchard
237-134493-0012	i get wet to my knees when i go down to pick cherries
237-134493-0013	indeed he had looked away with the purpose of not seeing it
237-134493-0014	they think you're proud because you've been away to school or something
237-134493-0015	there were something individual about the great farm a most unusual trimness and care for detail
237-134493-0016	on either side of the road for a mile before you reached the foot of the hill stood tall osage orange hedges their glossy green marking off the yellow fields
237-134493-0017	any one thereabouts would have told you that this was one of the richest farms on the divide and that the farmer was a woman alexandra burgesson
237-134493-0018	there is even a white row of beehives in the orchard under the walnut trees
237-126133-0000	here she would stay comforted and soothed among the lovely plants and rich exaltations rejoicing the heart of old turner the guardian who since polly's first rapturous entrance had taken her into his good graces for all time
237-126133-0001	every chance she could steal after practice hours were over and after the clamorous demands of the boys upon her time were fully satisfied was seized to fly on the wings of the wind to the flowers
237-126133-0002	then dear said missus whitney you must be kinder to her than ever think what it would be for one of you to be away from home even among friends
237-126133-0003	somewhere of all the days when the home feeling was the strongest this day it seemed as if she could bear it no longer
237-126133-0004	if she could only see franz for just one moment
237-126133-0005	oh she's always at the piano said ban she must be there now somewhere and then somebody laughed
237-126133-0006	at this the bundle opened suddenly and out popped fronsy
237-126133-0007	but polly couldn't speak and if jasper hadn't caught her just in time she would have tumbled over backward from the stool frances and all
237-126133-0008	asked franz with her little face close to polly's own
237-126133-0009	now you'll stay cried mae say polly won't you
237-126133-0010	oh you are the dearest and best mister king i ever saw but how did you make mamy let her come
237-126133-0011	isn't he splendid cried jasper in intense pride swelling up father knew how to do it
237-126133-0012	there there he said soothingly patting her brown fuzzy head
237-126133-0013	oh gasped polly controlling her sobs i won't only i can't thank you
237-126133-0014	asked franz in intense interest slipping down out of polly's arms and crowding up close to jasper's side
237-126133-0015	yes all alone by himself asserted jasper vehemently and wringing furiously to the others to stop their laughter he did now truly franz
237-126133-0016	oh no jasper i must go by my very own self
237-126133-0017	there japp you've caught it laughed purcy while the others screamed at the sight of jasper's face
237-126133-0018	don't mind it polly whispered jasper wasn't her fault
237-126133-0019	dear me ejaculated the old gentleman in the utmost amazement and such a time as i have had to get her here too
237-126133-0020	how did her mother ever let her go
237-126133-0021	she asked impulsively i didn't believe you could persuade her father
237-126133-0022	i didn't have any fears if i worked it rightly said the old gentleman complacently
237-126133-0023	he cried in high dudgeon just as if he owned the whole of the peppers and could dispose of them all to suit his fancy
237-126133-0024	and the old gentleman was so delighted with his success that he had to burst out into a series of short happy bits of laughter that occupied quite a space of time
237-126133-0025	at last he came out of them and wiped his face vigorously
3570-5694-0000	but already at a point in economic evolution far antedating the emergence of the lady specialized consumption of goods as an evidence of pecuniary strength had begun to work out in a more or less elaborate system
3570-5694-0001	the utility of consumption as an evidence of wealth is to be classified as a derivative growth
3570-5694-0002	such consumption as follows to the women is merely incidental to their work it is a means to their continued labor and not a consequence directed to their own comfort and usefulness of life
3570-5694-0003	with a further advance in culture this taboo may change into simple custom of a more or less rigorous character but whatever be the theoretical basis of the distinction which is maintained whether it be a taboo or a lateral convention the features of the conventional scheme of conception do not change easily
3570-5694-0004	in the nature of things luxuries and the comforts of life belong to the leisure class
3570-5694-0005	under the taboos certain victuals and more particularly certain beverages are strictly reserved for the use of the superior class
3570-5694-0006	drunkenness and the other pathological consequences of the free use of stimulants therefore tend in their turn to become unrificious as being a mark at the second remove of the superior states of those who are able to afford the indulgence
3570-5694-0007	it has even happened that the name for certain deceased conditions of the body arising from such an origin has passed into every day speech as a synonym for noble or gentle
3570-5694-0008	the consumption of luxuries in the true sense is a conception directed to the comfort of the consummate himself and is therefore a mark of the master
3570-5694-0009	with many qualifications with more qualifications as the patriarchal tradition has gradually weakened the general rule is felt to be right and binding that women should consume only for the benefit of their mates
3570-5694-0010	the objection of course presents itself that expenditure on women's dresses and household paraphernalia is an obvious exception to this rule but it will appear in the sequel that this exception is much more obvious than substantial
3570-5694-0011	the custom of festive gatherings probably originated in motives of conviviality and religion these motives are also present in the late development but they do not continue to be the sole motives
3570-5694-0012	there is a more or less elaborate system of rank and grades
3570-5694-0013	this differentiation is founded by the inheritance of wealth and the subsequent inheritance of gentility
3570-5694-0014	many of these officiated gentlemen of leisure are at the same time less men of substance in their own right so that some of them are scarcely at all others only partially to be rated as vicarious consumers
3570-5694-0015	so many of them however as make up the remainder and hangars on of the patron may be clashed as vicarious consummate without qualification
3570-5694-0016	many of these again and also many of the other aristocracy of least degree have in turn attached to their persons a more or less comprehensive group of vicarious consuls in the persons of their wives and children their servants retainers et cetera
3570-5694-0017	the wearing of uniforms or liveries implies a considerable degree of dependence and may even be said to be a mark of civility real or otherwise
3570-5694-0018	the wearers of uniforms and livers may be roughly divided into two classes the free and the servile or the noble and the ignoble
3570-5694-0019	but the general distinction is not on that account to be overlooked
3570-5694-0020	so those offices which are by right the proper employment of the leather class are noble such as government fighting hunting the care of arms and equipment and the like in short those which may be classified as obstinately predatory implements
3570-5694-0021	whenever as in these cases the menial service in question has to do directly with a primary leisure employment of fighting and hunting it easily acquiesces a reflected aurific character
3570-5694-0022	the livery becomes obnoxious to nearly all who are required to wear it
3570-5695-0000	in a general way though not wholly nor consistently these two groups coincide
3570-5695-0001	the department who was first delegated for these duties was the wife or the chief wife and as would be expected in the late development of the institution when the number of persons by whom these duties are systematically performed gradually narrows the wife remains the last
3570-5695-0002	but as we descend the social scale the point is presently reached where the duties of various leisure and consumption devolve upon the wife alone
3570-5695-0003	in the communities of the western culture this point is at present found among the lower middle class
3570-5695-0004	if beauty is confident is achieved and it is a more or less fortuitous circumstance if they are they must be achieved by means and methods that command themselves to the great economic law of wasted effort
3570-5695-0005	the man of the household can do something in this direction and indeed he commonly does but with a still lower descent into the levels of indigence along the margin of the slums the man and presently also the children virtually cease to consume valuable goods for appearances and the woman remains virtually the sole exponent of the household pecuniary decency
3570-5695-0006	very much of squall and discomfort will be endured before the last trinket or the last pretence of pecuniary decency is put away
3570-5695-0007	there is no class or no country that has yielded so abjectly before the pressure of physical want as to deny themselves all gratitude of this higher or spiritual need
3570-5695-0008	the question is which of the two methods will most effectively reach the persons whose convictions it is desired to affect
3570-5695-0009	each will therefore serve about equally well during the earlier stages of social growth
3570-5695-0010	the modern organization of industry works in the same direction also by another line
3570-5695-0011	it is evident therefore that the present trend of the development is in the direction of heightening the utility of conspicuous consumption as compared with leisure
3570-5695-0012	it is also noticeable that the civilization of consumption as a means of reprieve as well as the existence on it as an element of decency is at its best in those portions of the community where the human contact of the individual is widest and the mobility of the population is greatest
3570-5695-0013	consumption becomes a larger element in the standard of living in the city than in the country
3570-5695-0014	among the country population its place is to some extent taken by savings and homes comforts known through the medium of neighborhood gossip sufficiently to serve the like general purpose of pecuniary repute
3570-5695-0015	the result is a great mobility of the labor employed in printing perhaps greater than in any other equally well defined and considerable body of workmen
3570-5696-0000	under the simple test of affectiveness for advertising we should expect to find leisure and the conspicuous consumption of goods dividing the field of pecuniary emulation pretty evenly between them at the outset
3570-5696-0001	but the actual course of development has been somewhat different from this ideal scheme leasure held the first place at the start and came to old rank very much above wasteful consumption of goods both as a direct expense of wealth and as an element in the standard of decency during the quasi peaceful culture
3570-5696-0002	or the circumstance permitting that instinct dispose men to look with favor upon productive efficiency and on whatever is of human use
3570-5696-0003	reconciliation between the two conflicting requirements is affected by a resort to make believe many intricate politices and a deal of talk to the end that the talks may not have occurred to reflect on what is the factual economic value of their traffic
3570-5696-0004	the silent teeth of this development of domestic service have already been indicated
3570-5696-0005	throughout the entire evolution of conspicuous expenditure whether of goods or of services or human life runs the obvious implication that in order to effectively mend the consummate good fame it must be an expenditure of superfluities
3570-5696-0006	as used in the speech of every day life the word carries an undertone of deprecation
3570-5696-0007	the use of the word waste as a technical term therefore involves no deprecation of the motives or of the ends sought by the consumer under this canon of conspicuous waste
3570-5696-0008	but it is on other grounds worth noting that the term waste in the language of everyday life involves deprecation of what is characterized as wasteful
3570-5696-0009	strict accuracy nothing should be included under the head of conspicuous waste but such expenditure as is incurred on the ground of an invincible pecuniary comparison
3570-5696-0010	an article may be useful and wasteful both and its utility to the consumer may be made up of use and waste in the most varying proportions
5683-32865-0000	you know captain leake
5683-32865-0001	said lord chalford addressing me
5683-32865-0002	he had his hand upon leck's shoulder
5683-32865-0003	they are cousins you know we are all cousins
5683-32865-0004	whatever lord chelford said miss brandon received it very graciously and even with a momentary smile
5683-32865-0005	but her greeting to captain leek was more than usually haughty and frozen and her features i fancied particularly proud and pale
5683-32865-0006	at dinner lake was easy and amusing
5683-32865-0007	i am glad you like it says warrior chuckling benignly on it over his shoulder
5683-32865-0008	i believe i have a little taste that way those are all real you know those jewels
5683-32865-0009	and he placed it in that gentleman's fingers who now took his turn at the lamp and contemplated the little parallegram with a gleam of sly amusement
5683-32865-0010	was thinking it's very like the ace of hearts answered the captain softly smiling on
5683-32865-0011	whereupon lake laughed quietly still looking on the aces of hearts with his sly eyes
5683-32865-0012	and wilder left too more suddenly and noiseily than the humor of the joke seemed quite to call for and glanced a grim look from the corners of his eyes on lake but the gallant captain did not seem to perceive it and after a few seconds more he handed it very innocently back to missus darthy only remarking
5683-32865-0013	do you know lake oh i really can't tell but he'll soon tire of country life
5683-32865-0014	he's not a man for country quarters
5683-32865-0015	i had a horrid dream about him last night that
5683-32865-0016	oh i know that's lorne brandon
5683-32865-0017	all the time he was talking to me his angry little eyes were following lake
5683-32879-0000	it was not very much past eleven that morning when the pony carriage from brandon drove up before the little garden wicket of redmond's farm
5683-32879-0001	well she was better though she had had a bad night
5683-32879-0002	so there came a step and a little rustling of feminine drapery the small door opened and rachel entered with her hand extended and a pale smile of welcome
5683-32879-0003	women can hide their pain better than we men and bear it better too except when shame drops fire into the dreadful chalice
5683-32879-0004	but poor rachel lake had more than that stoic hypocrisy which enables the tortured spirits of her sex to lift a pale face through the flames and smile
5683-32879-0005	this transient spring and lighting up our beautiful a glamour begirling our senses
5683-32879-0006	there was something of sweetness and fondness in her tones and manner which was new to rachel and comforting and she returned the greeting as kindly and felt more like herself
5683-32879-0007	raits pale and sharpened features and dilated eyes struck her with a painful surprise
5683-32879-0008	you have been so ill my poor rachel
5683-32879-0009	ill and troubled dear troubled in mind and miserly nervous
5683-32879-0010	poor rachel her nature recoiled from defeat and she told at all events as much of the truth as she dared
5683-32879-0011	she spoke with a sudden energy which parted a fear and passion and flushed her thin cheek and made her languid eyes flash
5683-32879-0012	thank you rachel my cousin rachel my only friend
5683-32879-0013	chelford had a note from mister walder this morning another note his coming delayed and something of his having to see some person who is abroad continued dox after a little pause
5683-32879-0014	yes something everything said rachel hurriedly looking frowningly at a flower which she was twirling in her fingers
5683-32879-0015	yes said rachel
5683-32879-0016	and the wan oracle having spoken she sat down in the same sort of obstruction again beside doxas and she looked full in her cousin's eyes
5683-32879-0017	of mark wilder i say this his name has been for years hateful to me and recently it has become fruitful and you will promise me simply this that you will never ask me to speak again about him
5683-32879-0018	it is an antipathy an antagonism i cannot get it over dear doric you may think it a madness but don't blame me
5683-32879-0019	i have very few to love me now and i thought you might love me as i have begun to love you
5683-32879-0020	and she threw her arms round her cousin's neck and brave reachel at last burst into tears
5683-32879-0021	doctor in her strange way was moved
5683-32879-0022	i like you still rachel i'm sure i'll always like you
5683-32879-0023	you resemble me rachel you are fearless and inflexible and generous
5683-32879-0024	yes rachel i do love you
5683-32879-0025	thank you doctor dear
5683-32866-0000	miss lake declined the carriage to night
5683-32866-0001	and he added something still less complimentary
5683-32866-0002	but don't these very wise things sometimes turn out very foolishly
5683-32866-0003	in the meantime i had formed a new idea of her
5683-32866-0004	by this time lord chalford and waldor returned and disgusted rather with myself i ruminated on my want of generalship
5683-32866-0005	and he made a little dip of his cane toward brandon hall over his shoulder
5683-32866-0006	yes so they said but that would i think have been worse
5683-32866-0007	if a fellow's been a little bit wild he is bellowed at once
5683-32866-0008	brackton is a very good fellow i can assure you
5683-32866-0009	don't know and can't say how you fine gentlemen define wickedness only as an obscure female i speak according to my lights and he is generally thought the wickedest man in this county
5683-32866-0010	while you know reddy women like wicked fellows it is contrast i suppose but they do and i am sure from what bratton has said to me i know him intimately that doctor likes him and i can't conceive why they are not married
5683-32866-0011	their walk continued silent for the greater part neither was quite satisfied with the other but rachel at last said
5683-32866-0012	now that's impossible rety for i really don't think i once thought of him all this evening except just while we were talking
5683-32866-0013	there was a bright moonlight broken by the shadows of overhanging boughs and withered leaves and the mottled lights and shadows glided oddly across his pale features
5683-32866-0014	don't insult me standley by talking again as you did this morning
5683-32866-0015	what i say is altogether on your own account
5683-32866-0016	mark my words you'll find him too strong for you i and too deep
5683-32866-0017	i am very uneasy about it whatever it is i can't help it
5683-32866-0018	to my mind there has always been something inexhaustibly awful in family feuds
5683-32866-0019	the mystery of their origin their capacity for evolving latent faculties in every new born generation have associated them somehow in my mind with a spell of life exceeding and distinct from human and essential scientific action
5683-32866-0020	the floor more than anything else showed the great age of the room
5683-32866-0021	my bed was unexpectedly comfortable but in my then mood i could have wished it a great deal more modern
5683-32866-0022	its curtains were of thick and faded tapestry
5683-32866-0023	all the furniture belonged to other times
5683-32866-0024	i shan't trouble you about my train of thoughts or fancies but i began to feel very like a gentleman in a ghost story watching experimentally in a haunted chamber
5683-32866-0025	i did not even take the precaution of smoking up the chimney
5683-32866-0026	by boldly lighted my chereute
5683-32866-0027	a cold bright moon was shining with clear sharp lights and shadows
5683-32866-0028	the sombre old trees like gigantic hurst plumes black and awful
5683-32866-0029	somewhere i had grown nervous
5683-32866-0030	a little bit of plaster tumbled down the chimney and startled me confoundedly
121-121726-0000	also a popular contrivance whereby love making may be suspended but not stopped during the picnic season
121-121726-0001	herang the tiresome proverb of a tireless tongue
121-121726-0002	anguor paine painful to hear
121-121726-0003	hay fever a heart trouble caused by falling in love with a grass widow
121-121726-0004	heaven a good place to be raised to
121-121726-0005	he'd hedge a fence
121-121726-0006	heredity the cause of all our faults
121-121726-0007	horse sense a degree of wisdom that keeps one from betting on the races
121-121726-0008	hoze man's excuse for wetting the walk
121-121726-0009	hotel a place where a guest often gives up good dollars for poor quarters
121-121726-0010	house cleaning a domestic upheaval that makes it easy for the government to enlist all the soldiers it needs
121-121726-0011	husband the next thing to a wife
121-121726-0012	husky woman and bond tie
121-121726-0013	tyde to a woman
121-121726-0014	hipocratic a horse dealer
121-123859-0000	you are my all the world and i must strive to know my shames and praises from your tongue none else to me nor i to none alive that my steed sense or changes from your tongue none else to me nor i to none alive that my steed sense or changes right or wrong
121-123859-0001	oh tis the first tis flattery in my seeing and my great mind most kingly drinks it up mine eye well knows what with his gust is greeing and to his pallid doth prepare the cup if it be poisoned tist the lesser sin that mine eye loves it and doth first begin
121-123859-0002	but reckoning time whose million accidents creep in twixt hours why fearing of times tyranny might i not then say now i love you best when i were certain or uncertainty crowning the present doubting of the rest
121-123859-0003	love is a babe then might i not say so to give full growth to that which still doth grow
121-123859-0004	so i return rebuked to my content and gain by ill thrice more than i have spent
121-127105-0000	it was this observation that drew from douglas not immediately but later in the evening a reply that had the interesting consequence to which i call attention
121-127105-0001	someone else told a story not particularly offensive which i saw he was not following
121-127105-0002	cried one of the women he took no notice of her he looked at me but as if instead of me he saw what he spoke of
121-127105-0003	there were a unanimous groan at this and much reproach after which in his preoccupied way he explained
121-127105-0004	the stories written
121-127105-0005	i could write to my man and enclose the key he could send down the packet as he finds it
121-127105-0006	the others resented postponement but it was just his scruples that charmed me
121-127105-0007	to this his answer was prompt oh thank god no and is the record yours
121-127105-0008	he hung fire again a woman's
121-127105-0009	she has been dead these twenty years
121-127105-0010	she sent me the pages in question before she died
121-127105-0011	she was the most agreeable woman i've ever known in her position she would have been worthy of any whatever
121-127105-0012	it wasn't simply that she said so but that i knew she hadn't i was sure i could see
121-127105-0013	you'll easily judge why when you hear because the thing had been such a scare he continued to fix me
121-127105-0014	you are acute
121-127105-0015	he quitted the fire and dropped back into his chair
121-127105-0016	probably not till the second post
121-127105-0017	it was almost the tone of hope everybody will stay
121-127105-0018	cried the ladies whose department had been fixed
121-127105-0019	missus griffin however expressed the need for a little more light
121-127105-0020	who was it she was in love with the story will tell i took upon myself to reply oh i can't wait for the story the story won't tell said douglas not in any literal vulgar way more is the pity then
121-127105-0021	won't you tell douglas
121-127105-0022	well if i don't know who she was in love with i know who he was
121-127105-0023	let me say here distinctly to have done with it that this narrative from an exact transcript of my own made much later is what i shall presently give
121-127105-0024	poor douglas before his death when it was in sight committed to me the manuscript that reached him on the third of these days and that on the same spot with immense effect he began to read to our hushed little circle on the night of the fourth
121-127105-0025	the departing ladies who had said they would stay didn't of course thank heaven stay they departed in consequence of arrangements made in a rage of curiosity as they professeded produced by the touches with which he had already worked us up
121-127105-0026	the first of these touches conveyed that the written statement took up the tale at a point after it had in a manner begun
121-127105-0027	he had for his own town residence a big house filled with the spoils of travel and the trophies of the chase but it was to his country home an old family place in eggs that he wished her immediately to proceed
121-127105-0028	the awkward thing was that they had practically no other relations and that his own affairs took up all his time
121-127105-0029	there were plenty of people to help but of course the young lady who should go down as governess would be in supreme authority
121-127105-0030	i don't anticipate
121-127105-0031	she was young untidy nervous it was a vision of serious duties and little company of really great loneliness
121-127105-0032	yes but that's just the beauty of her passion
121-127105-0033	it was the beauty of it
121-127105-0034	it sounded dull that sounded strange and all the more because of his male condition which was
121-127105-0035	she promised to do this and she mentioned to me that when for a moment disburdened delighted he held her hand thanking her for the sacrifice she already felt rewarded
121-127105-0036	but was that all her reward one of the ladies asked
121-123852-0000	those pretty wrongs that liberty commits when i am some time absent from thy heart thy beauty and thy years full well befits for still temptation follows where thou art
121-123852-0001	aye me
121-123852-0002	now matter then although my foot did stand upon the farthest earth removed from thee for nimble thought can jump both sea and land as soon as think the place where he would be but ah
121-123852-0003	thought kills me that i am not thought to leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone but that so much of earth and water rawt i must attend times leisure with my moan receiving not by elements so slow but heavy tears badges of eighthers woe
121-123852-0004	my heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie a closet never pierced with criminal eyes but the defendant doth that plea deny and says in him thy fair appearance lies
