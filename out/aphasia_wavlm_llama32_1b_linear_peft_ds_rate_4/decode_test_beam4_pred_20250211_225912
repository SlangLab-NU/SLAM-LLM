fridriksson07a_924.145_1.83.wav_ASR	and they called the fire department
fridriksson07a_928.923_1.59.wav_ASR	so they'll get the cat out right
fridriksson07a_932.955_6.92.wav_ASR	well i couldn't understand what the ladder's for but i guess the guy climbed up the ladder and then fell down
fridriksson07a_954.76_0.34.wav_ASR	yes
fridriksson07a_958.107_4.76.wav_ASR	oh i think the last time i read it was very good
fridriksson07a_975.646_0.54.wav_ASR	oh okay
fridriksson07a_1095.08_12.54.wav_ASR	well the the thing of it is that cinderella was under the control of her stepmother and stepsisters
fridriksson07a_1108.411_2.15.wav_ASR	and they treated her like a maid
fridriksson07a_1111.509_4.88.wav_ASR	and then they were having a ball and everything
fridriksson07a_1117.065_3.86.wav_ASR	that's what she was looking out the window at the castle and everything
fridriksson07a_1121.443_6.61.wav_ASR	and then when they decided they wouldn't let her go because she would be in competition with the other girls
fridriksson07a_1129.018_3.57.wav_ASR	and then a fairy godmother came along
fridriksson07a_1133.326_5.58.wav_ASR	and got her all dressed and everything and ready to go to the ball
fridriksson07a_1139.72_2.4.wav_ASR	and give her a pair of slippers
fridriksson07a_1143.746_8.07.wav_ASR	and she went to the ball but she hadta be back by midnight
fridriksson07a_1153.31_1.67.wav_ASR	and so she was dancing
fridriksson07a_1155.0_4.63.wav_ASR	and the the prince chose her to go to the ball
fridriksson07a_1159.677_2.02.wav_ASR	and i guess he fell in love right away
fridriksson07a_1162.249_4.76.wav_ASR	and then the clock struck midnight
fridriksson07a_1167.86_3.01.wav_ASR	and she ran out but she lost the slipper
fridriksson07a_1172.448_1.9.wav_ASR	and then they found the slipper
fridriksson07a_1174.419_9.12.wav_ASR	and then by the time she got back her her chair had turned into a pumpkin
fridriksson07a_1184.579_1.19.wav_ASR	you know what i mean
fridriksson07a_1185.919_1.97.wav_ASR	okay now let me think again
fridriksson07a_1188.29_6.09.wav_ASR	and so they were going all over looking for the person that had the slipper
fridriksson07a_1194.4_3.25.wav_ASR	and they came back to cinderella's house
fridriksson07a_1198.045_4.27.wav_ASR	so they tried it with the two stepsisters and cinderella
fridriksson07a_1203.12_4.56.wav_ASR	so then they asked cinderella to go
fridriksson07a_1207.7_1.21.wav_ASR	and and they were just
fridriksson07a_1209.733_1.54.wav_ASR	oh no she wasn't even there
fridriksson07a_1211.295_5.34.wav_ASR	but when they turned it on then i thought
fridriksson07a_1217.703_5.54.wav_ASR	so they took her back to the the castle
fridriksson07a_1224.46_4.25.wav_ASR	and the she married the prince
fridriksson07a_1231.895_1.51.wav_ASR	you got all the
fridriksson07a_1233.591_1.89.wav_ASR	well i guess she lived happily ever after
fridriksson07a_1235.5_2.72.wav_ASR	that's the whole story like i said
fridriksson07a_1250.689_2.41.wav_ASR	oh well first you get the peanut butter and jelly
fridriksson07a_1253.322_1.07.wav_ASR	you get your bread

kansas04a_54.764_1.58.wav_ASR	well i started noticing
kansas04a_56.809_9.79.wav_ASR	and then i went out with my friends and they were concerned because i was in the hospital
kansas04a_68.079_9.21.wav_ASR	and she said that i drove too close to cars and i had a headache
kansas04a_77.957_5.16.wav_ASR	and i went home and i met my husband at the local hospital
kansas04a_84.83_3.35.wav_ASR	and had a drink and everything
kansas04a_88.529_5.344.wav_ASR	that was not my usual speech
kansas04a_95.153_1.87.wav_ASR	don't talking to anybody here
kansas04a_97.072_3.29.wav_ASR	and so i went home and i went to bed again
kansas04a_100.589_2.91.wav_ASR	and i got up the next morning and went to work
kansas04a_104.276_4.63.wav_ASR	and went to a a great place
kansas04a_109.508_10.63.wav_ASR	and i parked and went in and when i came back out i noticed something was wrong
kansas04a_121.372_4.48.wav_ASR	and i went to work and then one of the girls came along
kansas04a_126.873_2.64.wav_ASR	you're not using your arm correctly
kansas04a_131.007_0.4.wav_ASR	and i said
kansas04a_131.688_1.2.wav_ASR	oh i think i'm having a stroke
kansas04a_133.315_0.93.wav_ASR	call the doctor
kansas04a_134.744_8.79.wav_ASR	and he told me she told me to go to the emergency room and get a blood test
kansas04a_144.096_13.82.wav_ASR	and at that point i was confused enough that i was thinking about the ambulance across the street and not knowing what was going on
kansas04a_158.827_1.8.wav_ASR	so i think i drove myself
kansas04a_161.92_1.11.wav_ASR	so i drove myself
kansas04a_163.284_3.31.wav_ASR	well i got out there parked in the parking lot
kansas04a_167.312_3.2.wav_ASR	and then i met my husband there
kansas04a_170.986_6.08.wav_ASR	and i told him to tell them what i was doing
kansas04a_177.562_3.58.wav_ASR	because i could not communicate at all
kansas04a_182.356_4.06.wav_ASR	and i was there for over night and they said to me
kansas04a_187.406_9.41.wav_ASR	and then i did not feel well the next morning so i i had him take me back to the hospital and stay with me
kansas04a_207.011_5.1.wav_ASR	well i had therapy and all my speech and everything
kansas04a_213.604_6.17.wav_ASR	but they didn't give it to me at all
kansas04a_220.931_5.04.wav_ASR	and i mean when i was in the hospital i had my speech and all that stuff
kansas04a_226.382_3.15.wav_ASR	and then i got home and had some physical therapy
kansas04a_259.052_0.729.wav_ASR	you're sorry
kansas04a_263.423_8.6.wav_ASR	well when i got married the first time i hadta plan my whole wedding by myself
kansas04a_273.102_2.34.wav_ASR	and she left it up to me
kansas04a_276.529_5.33.wav_ASR	and i went home and then i fell asleep
kansas04a_281.881_3.75.wav_ASR	well i got married in firstnamel firstnamel
kansas04a_294.955_9.48.wav_ASR	and we had dinner and then we went to the movies
kansas04a_304.94_3.42.wav_ASR	and the i don't know what happened
kansas04a_309.335_2.86.wav_ASR	and he's a minister minister man
kansas04a_313.018_7.98.wav_ASR	and his wife took over the bathroom didn't let me get in the shower
kansas04a_322.108_15.2.wav_ASR	and so then we went to the chapel and on the way my brotherinlaw was driving with us
kansas04a_342.23_1.91.wav_ASR	well i think that will be enough at that point
kansas04a_369.621_4.36.wav_ASR	well this little boy is practicing his soccer ball
kansas04a_376.048_2.66.wav_ASR	and then he kicks it through the window
kansas04a_379.812_1.49.wav_ASR	and it breaks the window
kansas04a_382.375_3.03.wav_ASR	and it goes into this man's house
kansas04a_386.256_1.9.wav_ASR	and he's very startled
kansas04a_389.349_6.47.wav_ASR	and he gets up and looks out the window to see what's going on
kansas04a_396.096_10.7.wav_ASR	now it doesn't tell you whether the boy ran away or whether he came home
kansas04a_435.24_4.79.wav_ASR	mother wants the little boy to take the umbrella
kansas04a_443.068_1.73.wav_ASR	he doesn't want to take the umbrella
kansas04a_446.585_4.68.wav_ASR	so he goes out and it starts to rain of course as his mother hadta go away
kansas04a_452.243_1.56.wav_ASR	so he goes back
kansas04a_454.24_0.91.wav_ASR	and she tells him
kansas04a_455.171_1.15.wav_ASR	and he's very wet
kansas04a_457.426_5.56.wav_ASR	so we go back in the house and she's very angry with him because he hasn't taken the umbrella
kansas04a_463.777_7.44.wav_ASR	so in the last picture he has the umbrella and it's up and he's walking to school
kansas04a_506.81_1.84.wav_ASR	well the cat is in the tree
kansas04a_510.155_1.81.wav_ASR	dog is barking at the cat
kansas04a_513.126_4.38.wav_ASR	and the little girl is crying because her cat is in the tree
kansas04a_519.099_8.07.wav_ASR	and her father tried to get it with a ladder and couldn't get it down
kansas04a_527.276_4.41.wav_ASR	and the father is still in the tree and he's looking for the cat
kansas04a_532.649_2.56.wav_ASR	and the birds are singing
kansas04a_537.485_4.46.wav_ASR	that's really queer as everything else is
kansas04a_542.482_5.22.wav_ASR	and the firemen have been called and they are going to hafta get the cat down
kansas04a_547.988_3.8.wav_ASR	but i think before they do they'll hafta get me out
kansas04a_576.487_1.57.wav_ASR	there has been a flood
kansas04a_582.466_4.23.wav_ASR	and this lady has been swept away by the fairy godmother
kansas04a_590.504_12.69.wav_ASR	and this gentleman in the jetta is coming to rescue her
kansas04a_604.912_6.77.wav_ASR	is been swept away in the flood also by the water
kansas04a_613.723_13.02.wav_ASR	and i do not know what's going on
kansas04a_634.622_1.22.wav_ASR	yeah i think i am
kansas04a_636.851_1.21.wav_ASR	now what is that
kansas04a_643.48_6.31.wav_ASR	yeah but which one is being rescued by the firemen
kansas04a_661.844_0.6.wav_ASR	oh yes
kansas04a_668.087_0.84.wav_ASR	now not terrible
kansas04a_688.588_0.82.wav_ASR	okay
kansas04a_756.402_5.91.wav_ASR	the story's about cinderella and her two stepsisters
kansas04a_762.492_0.68.wav_ASR	and i said
kansas04a_763.997_11.67.wav_ASR	her stepsisters were very unhappy to her and didn't like her
kansas04a_776.051_5.38.wav_ASR	and cinderella was left to sweep and clean and do everything that had to be done
kansas04a_782.592_7.02.wav_ASR	so they got a letter inviting the household to the ball
kansas04a_791.424_5.37.wav_ASR	the mother said that cinderella was going to go
kansas04a_798.1_1.62.wav_ASR	and she was very upset
kansas04a_800.608_12.89.wav_ASR	and so she tried to get her dress together and the cinderella
kansas04a_815.132_22.74.wav_ASR	and so she went out and told her fairy godmother that she wanted to go
kansas04a_837.925_6.54.wav_ASR	and and she was crying and and the fairy godmother said
kansas04a_845.377_4.79.wav_ASR	got her dress and with her wand of magic
kansas04a_850.747_14.83.wav_ASR	and so the stepstepmother and stepchildren started out at at the ball
kansas04a_865.963_15.24.wav_ASR	but she went in the carriage that the fairy godmother had converted out a pumpkin and mice into a beautiful carriage
kansas04a_881.57_0.95.wav_ASR	the horse was
kansas04a_883.45_2.91.wav_ASR	and she went to the ball
kansas04a_887.004_4.42.wav_ASR	and the prince greeted her and said
kansas04a_892.03_1.55.wav_ASR	and they danced
kansas04a_893.647_1.85.wav_ASR	and then it was a twelve o'clock
kansas04a_895.645_2.1.wav_ASR	and she hadta be home by twelve o'clock
kansas04a_897.799_2.56.wav_ASR	so she ran out and lost her slipper
kansas04a_901.571_7.85.wav_ASR	and she went and got the carriage and of course it was a pumpkin
kansas04a_909.825_1.47.wav_ASR	and she went home
kansas04a_912.607_9.82.wav_ASR	and then the following week or so i had a stroke
kansas04a_922.783_10.71.wav_ASR	the the slipper was sent out with the slipper to find which girl could fit it
kansas04a_934.46_7.29.wav_ASR	and she was locked in her room so she could not get to the ball
kansas04a_942.65_2.64.wav_ASR	and she was very upset
kansas04a_946.239_4.44.wav_ASR	and the
kansas04a_952.096_3.38.wav_ASR	and anyway the the mice locked up
kansas04a_957.72_3.9.wav_ASR	and she came down and and of course she fit the slipper
kansas04a_962.075_1.87.wav_ASR	but the other didn't work

kansas05a_401.308_2.97.wav_ASR	well i useta have time at times gone on i hadta go home
kansas05a_405.255_6.03.wav_ASR	but now where are we going to start
kansas05a_411.561_1.63.wav_ASR	what we asked me to do
kansas05a_420.085_1.64.wav_ASR	oh yes when i was talking about here
kansas05a_422.593_9.96.wav_ASR	we're i'm working along with working towards having more speech therapy
kansas05a_434.918_3.07.wav_ASR	at time goes on i learn more and more and more
kansas05a_439.556_1.65.wav_ASR	and so that's when i thought
kansas05a_467.065_0.97.wav_ASR	so they come dead
kansas05a_468.95_4.67.wav_ASR	so tell me the story with a beginning middle and an end
kansas05a_473.861_0.95.wav_ASR	how many one
kansas05a_480.821_2.29.wav_ASR	so each one of these i'm sposta do something different
kansas05a_483.43_0.79.wav_ASR	that was what you're saying
kansas05a_497.343_0.77.wav_ASR	uhhuh
kansas05a_504.475_17.939.wav_ASR	well the first one is learning through this computer program
kansas05a_529.355_7.84.wav_ASR	it's a plant a plant a tree
kansas05a_540.213_11.2.wav_ASR	that's a a plant a plant that's a living thing
kansas05a_554.453_7.16.wav_ASR	there's a friend eating with that person
kansas05a_563.678_3.27.wav_ASR	because these people are making a good job
kansas05a_580.09_0.63.wav_ASR	what is that
kansas05a_589.826_1.82.wav_ASR	oh that's kind of dumb stuff
kansas05a_593.266_2.41.wav_ASR	and i think that takes a little work to make that look good
kansas05a_596.395_2.36.wav_ASR	okay i suppose so
kansas05a_600.809_1.48.wav_ASR	when i was sposta do with this one
kansas05a_603.491_0.94.wav_ASR	what's it afraid of
kansas05a_605.0_1.13.wav_ASR	did the window break
kansas05a_608.523_1.45.wav_ASR	okay well that's it
kansas05a_643.723_19.47.wav_ASR	so the the first person is cinderella
kansas05a_666.113_5.28.wav_ASR	it's a knife
kansas05a_674.141_4.53.wav_ASR	looking at the trees ten and a half
kansas05a_681.195_14.69.wav_ASR	and believing that the second people should be
kansas05a_702.031_0.71.wav_ASR	and i think so
kansas05a_703.736_3.14.wav_ASR	he he's not sposta do that one
kansas05a_708.008_3.8.wav_ASR	well this one guy wants to call me
kansas05a_712.325_1.15.wav_ASR	or he wants it by himself
kansas05a_715.293_1.03.wav_ASR	well that's not quite right
kansas05a_718.205_0.34.wav_ASR	what
kansas05a_719.0_0.38.wav_ASR	what's your name
kansas05a_721.863_10.62.wav_ASR	there he's looking out far on the the the the the the children are going to school
kansas05a_732.528_5.87.wav_ASR	and the the old stuff that this is a good one
kansas05a_740.616_16.13.wav_ASR	there the the the mother is not not happy with her her person of what went all the time
kansas05a_759.633_4.72.wav_ASR	then he went back to school
kansas05a_764.921_0.88.wav_ASR	actually i see it
kansas05a_766.03_12.56.wav_ASR	his mother wanted him to go back to the good stuff he was done before so that he can go back on to this this kind of
kansas05a_779.24_4.95.wav_ASR	and they go back and the ideas that he's got make them go back and look at it again
kansas05a_812.463_2.81.wav_ASR	well i guess you start with the bread
kansas05a_819.976_6.9.wav_ASR	people sitting with their the they're messy and all that
kansas05a_827.928_1.1.wav_ASR	one two his shoe
kansas05a_831.043_4.35.wav_ASR	once the the kind of a bazaar is happening

kansas05a_848.486_4.42.wav_ASR	it was going to be originally care by this young man
kansas05a_854.133_3.71.wav_ASR	just can't make it is big enough to make that kind of thing
kansas05a_859.378_4.24.wav_ASR	then there would be this thing in the way
kansas05a_864.8_5.88.wav_ASR	and this isn't necessarily what's going on in the story
kansas05a_872.161_11.16.wav_ASR	here's the the people the people

kurland04b_86.066_1.83.wav_ASR	and i went grocery shopping
kurland04b_87.917_1.1.wav_ASR	and i came back

kurland04b_129.746_2.86.wav_ASR	yeah i didn't have any physical therapy
kurland04b_132.621_4.78.wav_ASR	yeah i guess that we covered a lot of ground
kurland04b_138.092_15.04.wav_ASR	but at speech therapy the therapist gave me some websites that i could go to
kurland04b_153.317_5.67.wav_ASR	and i i do a lot of things
kurland04b_159.539_3.23.wav_ASR	and i do all go to school

kurland04b_214.256_6.46.wav_ASR	but my father useta buy all three of his daughters a beautiful dress
kurland04b_221.109_3.59.wav_ASR	and he would ram them up and put them under my tongue
kurland04b_225.267_2.31.wav_ASR	and somebody was with her
kurland04b_227.736_3.29.wav_ASR	is this a salad and this is my pants and this is my shirt

kurland04b_243.417_4.24.wav_ASR	and so later on i found my speech therapist
kurland04b_247.966_3.49.wav_ASR	and i ended it and put the jelly on it
kurland04b_274.187_0.59.wav_ASR	okay
kurland04b_275.784_3.38.wav_ASR	there was a boy playing soccer
kurland04b_279.21_1.19.wav_ASR	and he kicked the ball
kurland04b_280.601_3.34.wav_ASR	and the ball went through the window
kurland04b_285.546_0.94.wav_ASR	he was outside
kurland04b_286.501_2.07.wav_ASR	and he kicked the ball inside
kurland04b_289.17_4.27.wav_ASR	and it it knocked over a lamp
kurland04b_294.053_5.06.wav_ASR	and his father is angry
kurland04b_300.412_1.58.wav_ASR	and then all of a sudden
kurland04b_302.676_5.89.wav_ASR	he picked up the ball and looked through the hole at the window
kurland04b_324.62_0.7.wav_ASR	okay
kurland04b_325.478_5.62.wav_ASR	the boy was walking or was going to school
kurland04b_332.737_2.95.wav_ASR	and his mother wanted him to take the umbrella
kurland04b_335.708_1.08.wav_ASR	and he said no
kurland04b_337.284_1.26.wav_ASR	so he left
kurland04b_339.461_2.31.wav_ASR	his mother wasn't too pleased
kurland04b_342.508_3.26.wav_ASR	and while he was walking to school it started raining
kurland04b_346.492_1.52.wav_ASR	so he ran back home
kurland04b_348.069_5.04.wav_ASR	and his mother saw him and and thought he was wet
kurland04b_353.882_7.11.wav_ASR	and he got the umbrella and walked back to school with the rain
kurland04b_374.405_13.31.wav_ASR	the man was trying to get the cat down
kurland04b_388.147_1.2.wav_ASR	he had a ladder
kurland04b_389.936_2.71.wav_ASR	and he climbed up onto the branch
kurland04b_392.665_2.29.wav_ASR	and the ladder fell over
kurland04b_395.678_2.92.wav_ASR	and someone called the fire department
kurland04b_399.132_5.21.wav_ASR	and the fire department came and got everyone out of the tree
kurland04b_411.534_0.48.wav_ASR	uhhuh
kurland04b_418.783_0.42.wav_ASR	okay
kurland04b_501.28_0.938.wav_ASR	okay
kurland04b_502.933_10.18.wav_ASR	and cinderella's father married a woman with two daughters
kurland04b_514.207_23.16.wav_ASR	and so the her cinderella's two stepsisters and her stepmother made cinderella clean up all the work
kurland04b_537.717_2.96.wav_ASR	and she hadta wash the floor
kurland04b_576.021_10.95.wav_ASR	and so the two stepsisters weren't going to go to the ball
kurland04b_588.209_21.45.wav_ASR	so after they left for the ball cinderella's fairy godmother came and was able to make her a beautiful dress
kurland04b_610.285_3.9.wav_ASR	and the pumpkin pumpkin changed into a carriage
kurland04b_614.697_6.21.wav_ASR	and the rats her mice turned into horses
kurland04b_621.488_7.74.wav_ASR	and her fairy godmother told her she hadta be back home by midnight or the slipper was gone
kurland04b_629.955_4.56.wav_ASR	and so she went in the dance
kurland04b_636.078_5.33.wav_ASR	and at the ball she met the prince
kurland04b_641.783_1.09.wav_ASR	and they dance
kurland04b_643.405_4.44.wav_ASR	and then the clock struck midnight
kurland04b_648.219_3.82.wav_ASR	and cinderella ran away
kurland04b_652.338_6.83.wav_ASR	and as she ran away her one of her glass slippers fell off
kurland04b_659.969_1.51.wav_ASR	and the prince picked it up
kurland04b_663.127_2.45.wav_ASR	and so then he
kurland04b_665.948_6.29.wav_ASR	it was the only way that he could find her was through the the dance
kurland04b_672.358_3.3.wav_ASR	so he went to everyone in the kingdom
kurland04b_676.494_9.98.wav_ASR	and at cinderella's house her stepsisters hadta try it on
kurland04b_686.985_3.17.wav_ASR	and the mice came and gave her a key
kurland04b_691.051_8.14.wav_ASR	and then the prince tried the slipper on cinderella
kurland04b_699.268_6.01.wav_ASR	and their feet were too big for the the glass slipper
kurland04b_705.772_6.16.wav_ASR	and then cinderella came out of the the palace
kurland04b_711.953_4.78.wav_ASR	and the glass glass slipper fit cinderella
kurland04b_717.438_7.39.wav_ASR	and the prince and cinderella were live happily ever after
kurland04b_737.783_0.71.wav_ASR	okay
kurland04b_739.13_3.31.wav_ASR	and i would get two pieces of bread
kurland04b_743.279_3.94.wav_ASR	and i would get out the peanut butter and jelly
kurland04b_747.695_7.73.wav_ASR	and then i would spread one slice with peanut butter and the other slice with jelly
kurland04b_756.291_5.4.wav_ASR	then i would put the two pieces together
kurland04b_762.256_2.42.wav_ASR	and i said
kurland04b_764.991_0.62.wav_ASR	and eat it
kurland04b_770.477_0.39.wav_ASR	well
kurland04b_771.798_0.74.wav_ASR	what are you up to
kurland05a_152.51_11.42.wav_ASR	well if i hadta say it was a ten before the stroke i'd say probably five or six years ago
kurland05a_170.84_0.89.wav_ASR	oh yeah very well
kurland05a_173.8_2.07.wav_ASR	yeah it was a sunday afternoon
kurland05a_176.666_5.67.wav_ASR	and i went for a ride in my my little scooter
kurland05a_182.382_2.67.wav_ASR	he was about fifty years old
kurland05a_185.106_6.18.wav_ASR	and he had downstaircase so he wasn't fifteen she was probably about fifteen
kurland05a_191.809_0.48.wav_ASR	and that's the end
kurland05a_193.024_1.21.wav_ASR	and one for her
kurland05a_194.282_4.53.wav_ASR	and doing it right something you know
kurland05a_198.988_5.04.wav_ASR	and you know i i couldn't write
kurland05a_204.622_1.36.wav_ASR	and i don't know the word
kurland05a_206.0_7.82.wav_ASR	and i was working on my right side more than my left side
kurland05a_214.253_10.25.wav_ASR	and as it turned out my speech was about about two or three to ten minutes a day
kurland05a_224.887_1.16.wav_ASR	and then it was a key long ago
kurland05a_226.186_1.23.wav_ASR	and you know what i mean
kurland05a_227.514_1.77.wav_ASR	and i sit down
kurland05a_229.301_2.07.wav_ASR	was about three o'clock three forty five
kurland05a_233.454_3.19.wav_ASR	well i'm not as scared of a child as i used to be
kurland05a_236.666_2.23.wav_ASR	and i let them get my hair done
kurland05a_239.553_2.92.wav_ASR	and then my wife was sitting with fifty one
kurland05a_242.497_0.96.wav_ASR	wait a long time
kurland05a_243.476_2.08.wav_ASR	and i knew it was a stroke
kurland05a_245.637_2.84.wav_ASR	so i i thought
kurland05a_248.5_4.2.wav_ASR	and i couldn't even get anything more than you know
kurland05a_253.449_5.039.wav_ASR	and the person on the phone i i don't know who was there
kurland05a_258.926_0.77.wav_ASR	take one or two
kurland05a_259.718_0.4.wav_ASR	and i said
kurland05a_260.801_1.56.wav_ASR	now it says cinderella
kurland05a_262.38_1.63.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
kurland05a_264.131_0.78.wav_ASR	they got a stroke
kurland05a_265.201_4.64.wav_ASR	and so she put me in the hospital
kurland05a_271.108_7.69.wav_ASR	and i didn't talk to my wife you know because i didn't want the that's
kurland05a_279.654_5.22.wav_ASR	so i thought i'd go away and you could continue to do that
kurland05a_285.064_4.19.wav_ASR	and so we went to the hospital
kurland05a_290.627_4.48.wav_ASR	it went to the hospital for me
kurland05a_295.586_1.9.wav_ASR	and i try to go to work and in motion
kurland05a_298.262_0.91.wav_ASR	and i don't know what happened
kurland05a_300.327_6.55.wav_ASR	and i drove my truck from happy mass all the way up to philadelphia
kurland05a_307.424_2.24.wav_ASR	it's a problem with me
kurland05a_310.553_6.46.wav_ASR	and on the way out it kicked through a window
kurland05a_317.918_3.01.wav_ASR	you know the rubber stroke you know right there
kurland05a_321.108_4.34.wav_ASR	and they i went off the road down cinderella country for a place to stay
kurland05a_326.11_8.58.wav_ASR	at that point there i decided i i got a little more than you know a good job
kurland05a_335.758_3.8.wav_ASR	so i i went home and that's the day i told my wife
kurland05a_340.564_1.36.wav_ASR	ten at ten in the morning
kurland05a_342.93_1.48.wav_ASR	and one day i told my wife
kurland05a_344.754_2.02.wav_ASR	and it was at the hospital
kurland05a_346.798_14.85.wav_ASR	you know you know the whole day they found out that if you go to the doctors in this three hours is you know a stroke they have chance to change the disease or something like that
kurland05a_362.512_4.01.wav_ASR	and it was the horse is out of the barn but tonight i don't know what's going on
kurland05a_367.407_2.24.wav_ASR	and i took the ambulance
kurland05a_369.736_4.53.wav_ASR	and you know i once just just speak therapy and all that
kurland05a_375.33_1.04.wav_ASR	there's two other types of them
kurland05a_376.429_0.74.wav_ASR	and i thought
kurland05a_377.191_1.66.wav_ASR	but those last a pretty long time
kurland05a_378.867_3.56.wav_ASR	and it's a speech therapy you know last at the thing
kurland05a_383.2_3.25.wav_ASR	and finally my therapist said to me
kurland05a_386.799_2.27.wav_ASR	you think you've reached the your place yet
kurland05a_389.246_3.71.wav_ASR	and they're far away and all of a sudden i was aware of it
kurland05a_393.01_3.82.wav_ASR	and it brings a smile to my face
kurland05a_396.85_2.72.wav_ASR	and i i planted you know after the stroke
kurland05a_399.661_4.34.wav_ASR	and now it's six and a half years later i'm still pretty good
kurland05a_421.506_4.57.wav_ASR	one thing that was quite clear to me
kurland05a_426.134_3.9.wav_ASR	so i useta get like six or seven sleeping at night you know
kurland05a_430.627_6.75.wav_ASR	well i probably went to nine hours you know with an ambulance in the afternoon of the first of january
kurland05a_439.185_11.7.wav_ASR	and my therapy you know i i told my therapist that i was a salesperson in the retail industry
kurland05a_450.9_1.92.wav_ASR	but she tried to help me with that
kurland05a_453.377_9.07.wav_ASR	and the only way i could really finish i i i could either use the keys cards you know to get out
kurland05a_463.012_4.16.wav_ASR	or i could have written a paper in the last year
kurland05a_467.738_5.68.wav_ASR	but i i was not able to really talk you know with one hand
kurland05a_475.53_10.57.wav_ASR	just the best way i can describe things if i was a thirty five year older arabic or something like that
kurland05a_486.35_2.39.wav_ASR	and i just couldn't get in the same way
kurland05a_489.477_14.42.wav_ASR	and it's not quite so bad you know initially but when i talk to a bunch of people in north america there's you know noise from all around the world
kurland05a_504.51_7.96.wav_ASR	very much like downstairs there's there's two people in the house
kurland05a_515.462_0.671.wav_ASR	it's gonna be better
kurland05a_554.732_7.46.wav_ASR	well i've had many things happen but i think one that was very good
kurland05a_564.856_3.3.wav_ASR	my stroke took place a few years ago
kurland05a_568.92_6.03.wav_ASR	and my physical therapist ended up first you know for four years
kurland05a_575.71_0.86.wav_ASR	and it was i said
kurland05a_576.684_1.21.wav_ASR	who married firstnamej
kurland05a_578.401_1.34.wav_ASR	at least five months to stay
kurland05a_579.76_4.27.wav_ASR	well i was all around all the places
kurland05a_584.704_4.17.wav_ASR	so i i want a trip to arizona
kurland05a_589.765_1.96.wav_ASR	and it hits a window
kurland05a_592.346_2.85.wav_ASR	and then it was my my wife and i went there
kurland05a_595.53_1.56.wav_ASR	and i took one of the sons
kurland05a_601.36_2.91.wav_ASR	and that was the end of it
kurland05a_604.371_11.19.wav_ASR	and when i got up to address the owner i said
kurland05a_622.298_0.93.wav_ASR	and that's the whole thing
kurland05a_624.482_0.93.wav_ASR	and never useta drive
kurland05a_630.564_8.41.wav_ASR	but you know it's just something that they said the a negative feeling or a loss for everybody in the family
kurland05a_639.446_6.27.wav_ASR	and that's you know and as you can see it's a pretty good one
kurland05a_649.2_2.38.wav_ASR	and it's raining
kurland05a_653.67_4.13.wav_ASR	and here a major race is going on
kurland05a_662.527_0.85.wav_ASR	so that's the way it goes
kurland05a_666.225_1.64.wav_ASR	and it's raining
kurland05a_668.408_6.34.wav_ASR	because you know i'd be with a crack in a job or something different than you know what i used to do
kurland05a_674.801_6.03.wav_ASR	you know it's just very good
kurland05a_685.515_3.9.wav_ASR	oh no
kurland05a_690.856_2.46.wav_ASR	you know washing the tv show and all that
kurland05a_695.249_3.53.wav_ASR	it might be some stuff like the bathroom or something
kurland05a_700.718_10.62.wav_ASR	if i come in you know they'll have cinderella and all the little cinderella stuff whatever you know i look forward to seeing her a lot of times
kurland05a_712.137_5.12.wav_ASR	and i don't like to show my wife but i just you know i think about it a lot
kurland05a_717.971_2.22.wav_ASR	it's it's very good
kurland05a_722.507_2.3.wav_ASR	well it a bunch of my friends were there
kurland05a_725.084_2.06.wav_ASR	oh the navy and a kindergarten
kurland05a_727.159_0.59.wav_ASR	and i thought
kurland05a_736.401_0.79.wav_ASR	knock on the door
kurland05a_767.64_0.42.wav_ASR	alright
kurland05a_768.713_6.43.wav_ASR	well this comes to the room because i play on the radio all the time
kurland05a_775.731_4.04.wav_ASR	and the first picture shows a a young guy is going to school
kurland05a_780.772_0.81.wav_ASR	he kicks the ball
kurland05a_781.6_6.34.wav_ASR	and he must be too close to the house because he he comes home
kurland05a_789.212_6.9.wav_ASR	and as luck would have it the homeowner was sitting right by the window
kurland05a_796.131_4.91.wav_ASR	and he knocked the lamp over so he landed on his lap
kurland05a_801.46_2.26.wav_ASR	so it did colorful damage to me
kurland05a_804.612_7.97.wav_ASR	and the last picture shows the home depot all holding the soccer ball in their hand
kurland05a_812.6_5.26.wav_ASR	so i can only manage what happened on the physical therapy
kurland05a_855.661_3.73.wav_ASR	well i guess it shows a woman and a probably a child
kurland05a_860.063_1.44.wav_ASR	and he wants to go outside again
kurland05a_862.307_0.51.wav_ASR	but she's
kurland05a_862.998_2.06.wav_ASR	take your umbrella
kurland05a_865.108_1.27.wav_ASR	and he didn't die
kurland05a_867.751_2.56.wav_ASR	and she offered it to her trying it on
kurland05a_870.393_1.62.wav_ASR	and i still don't know
kurland05a_872.035_0.74.wav_ASR	and he was outside
kurland05a_872.828_3.42.wav_ASR	and the third picture shows the third picture shows a girl
kurland05a_876.326_4.09.wav_ASR	and of course the fourth picture shows it's getting dirty worse and worse
kurland05a_882.162_1.98.wav_ASR	so he goes back inside the school
kurland05a_884.93_0.85.wav_ASR	and mother said
kurland05a_885.939_0.89.wav_ASR	well i told you so
kurland05a_886.879_5.12.wav_ASR	and the last picture shows him with a umbrella like he's going to school
kurland05a_903.958_0.5.wav_ASR	alright
kurland05a_916.499_3.08.wav_ASR	well eventually a cat climbed the tree
kurland05a_919.6_3.77.wav_ASR	and as cats are purring it couldn't get down the tree
kurland05a_925.566_9.21.wav_ASR	and a homeowner or somebody you know a mailman trying to get up the tree and get the cat down
kurland05a_936.567_1.42.wav_ASR	the girl's crying for a cat
kurland05a_939.74_3.82.wav_ASR	oh the reason the guy's gonna get down because this ladder fell down
kurland05a_944.348_0.99.wav_ASR	so he's stuck in the tree
kurland05a_945.353_5.63.wav_ASR	and the dog is barking at the cat and the man
kurland05a_951.07_3.66.wav_ASR	so i guess we know why the cat is up in the tree
kurland05a_955.677_6.53.wav_ASR	and then way to the right shows the fire department comes to get the cat down from the tree
kurland05a_965.049_1.31.wav_ASR	miss the this one
kurland05a_992.053_3.05.wav_ASR	oh my son watch cinderella for me
kurland05a_997.143_0.83.wav_ASR	he he what is it
kurland05a_998.255_3.97.wav_ASR	you watch all the disney movies you know all the time
kurland05a_1003.251_2.88.wav_ASR	and and i mean once upon a time that's not what it used to be
kurland05a_1008.346_1.36.wav_ASR	forty five years ago
kurland05a_1011.908_1.15.wav_ASR	well most of them
kurland05a_1016.878_9.9.wav_ASR	well it i watched so many movies with them cinderella might even in the beginning
kurland05a_1041.624_0.32.wav_ASR	wait a minute
kurland05a_1045.64_1.219.wav_ASR	that's the right one
kurland05a_1049.637_0.39.wav_ASR	okay
kurland05a_1129.285_5.26.wav_ASR	well i'm gonna give you my version it's gonna be okay
kurland05a_1136.092_2.46.wav_ASR	it starts off at the window
kurland05a_1138.93_1.73.wav_ASR	and i think she has two sisters
kurland05a_1140.678_8.22.wav_ASR	and she's a less favorite of the other three even though she's the one with the
kurland05a_1150.4_1.95.wav_ASR	her mother is even older
kurland05a_1152.368_6.1.wav_ASR	you know i i can compare the evil godmother to cinderella
kurland05a_1159.027_3.22.wav_ASR	and they usually don't
kurland05a_1163.206_2.53.wav_ASR	and anyway she wanted to go to the ball
kurland05a_1165.752_0.99.wav_ASR	well she couldn't move at all
kurland05a_1166.764_5.58.wav_ASR	it's somewhere she she got the slipper
kurland05a_1172.459_3.71.wav_ASR	and then at the ball there's a dance
kurland05a_1177.292_2.11.wav_ASR	and i think he had a slipper
kurland05a_1179.426_3.52.wav_ASR	and he tried to slip around the everybody everybody
kurland05a_1183.783_5.14.wav_ASR	and as luck would have it cinderella you know fit into the slipper
kurland05a_1190.594_3.78.wav_ASR	and anyway i hope that's enough
kurland05a_1194.524_3.16.wav_ASR	so i think you know they're happy to see me
kurland05a_1201.033_0.43.wav_ASR	the end
kurland05a_1220.688_0.84.wav_ASR	that's pretty easy
kurland05a_1222.699_3.27.wav_ASR	and i would take the peanut butter on that side of the bread
kurland05a_1227.109_5.61.wav_ASR	and i usually only rolls whole wheat bread because that's the way i like it
kurland05a_1234.237_4.55.wav_ASR	and i can tell you that i've been making lunches for a long time
kurland05a_1239.613_1.78.wav_ASR	and every tuesday has the people there
kurland05a_1241.442_5.12.wav_ASR	well i always had a whole piece of two pieces of bread
kurland05a_1247.075_1.39.wav_ASR	learn a little bit
kurland05a_1249.538_2.64.wav_ASR	and one i put the grape jelly
kurland05a_1252.921_0.81.wav_ASR	he lost rain
kurland05a_1254.656_4.23.wav_ASR	and then i put a slice of bread spread a peanut butter on it
kurland05a_1259.156_3.63.wav_ASR	and i put the pieces of bread together
kurland05a_1262.831_7.23.wav_ASR	and i cut them four pieces because you know milk all the way to a sandwich or something like that
kurland05a_1270.32_5.5.wav_ASR	and then i i have a little bag that they give me
kurland05a_1275.84_2.65.wav_ASR	and they close the sandwich up
kurland05a_1278.506_3.21.wav_ASR	and i can't remember
kurland05b_50.075_4.4.wav_ASR	my speech is as i just said it's pretty good
kurland05b_56.5_10.98.wav_ASR	you know if you're gonna have a raise of one to ten and ten be your stroke it probably raises from one to seven or eight
kurland05b_68.384_18.84.wav_ASR	and depending on you know how much sleep i had and you know what did the day before and you know if you feel like you're in a high side it it's gonna be very easy to say you know
kurland05b_97.474_0.39.wav_ASR	oh yeah
kurland05b_101.171_8.37.wav_ASR	my stroke occurred on a sunday in january
kurland05b_110.667_3.95.wav_ASR	people three or four before in the beginning
kurland05b_115.886_5.05.wav_ASR	and i was taking my son firstnamek for a ride to school
kurland05b_121.942_7.89.wav_ASR	and sometimes during the ride about an hour ride it's hard to talk
kurland05b_131.038_7.6.wav_ASR	and but she didn't feel good about it
kurland05b_138.764_4.16.wav_ASR	and i i know something was wrong but that's the whole problem with it
kurland05b_144.024_7.14.wav_ASR	so not long before my wife and i didn't say anything to my wife about it
kurland05b_151.185_2.78.wav_ASR	and you know that night i went home
kurland05b_153.981_3.23.wav_ASR	and next morning i woke up
kurland05b_158.031_2.08.wav_ASR	well i went to work you know like a normal person
kurland05b_161.057_5.69.wav_ASR	and drive to work because my right hand is not working
kurland05b_166.826_2.53.wav_ASR	the left side of my right side is paralyzed
kurland05b_169.989_2.67.wav_ASR	we kicked it out the window
kurland05b_173.568_4.83.wav_ASR	and i got on a plane from springfield to chicago
kurland05b_179.316_1.64.wav_ASR	and i kept going over the road again
kurland05b_182.108_9.76.wav_ASR	and i know it was gonna talk to anybody because i i know it but just has something wrong with my speech and everything
kurland05b_191.892_5.03.wav_ASR	so i i picked up some kind of cereal that i sold most of the time
kurland05b_196.973_3.33.wav_ASR	and then i got the cardiologist to help me
kurland05b_200.538_0.84.wav_ASR	forty bags
kurland05b_201.657_1.03.wav_ASR	and then they came back
kurland05b_203.698_3.23.wav_ASR	and then i got up in the wheelchair
kurland05b_207.883_1.73.wav_ASR	and i drove down to sinai and i thought
kurland05b_210.089_2.3.wav_ASR	and i saw something happening down there
kurland05b_212.464_1.61.wav_ASR	he's going off the rain
kurland05b_215.133_5.91.wav_ASR	down the side of cinderella and went right up a side walk to go home
kurland05b_221.891_4.39.wav_ASR	at that point there i i figured there's some of these are not good
kurland05b_226.335_2.1.wav_ASR	so i i don't know
kurland05b_229.055_2.63.wav_ASR	and about two o'clock it starts to rain
kurland05b_231.708_2.62.wav_ASR	and i went to the emergency room
kurland05b_234.375_2.94.wav_ASR	and the other one
kurland05b_237.33_1.8.wav_ASR	you know i said it's the right one
kurland05b_239.747_1.31.wav_ASR	you know the phone is right here
kurland05b_241.287_2.06.wav_ASR	my wife was like twelve and a half
kurland05b_244.599_0.87.wav_ASR	and they answered the phone
kurland05b_245.491_5.89.wav_ASR	and i think it's a long and maybe you know
kurland05b_251.454_3.41.wav_ASR	and the other person wasn't a nice person
kurland05b_256.869_0.559.wav_ASR	it was right
kurland05b_258.3_6.88.wav_ASR	and the person on the other side it was a female that was
kurland05b_266.088_0.42.wav_ASR	and she said
kurland05b_266.653_0.63.wav_ASR	think you had a stroke
kurland05b_267.375_0.45.wav_ASR	so she says
kurland05b_268.156_0.55.wav_ASR	what's the word
kurland05b_268.782_0.81.wav_ASR	so i said
kurland05b_269.867_0.57.wav_ASR	peanut butter
kurland05b_271.723_3.86.wav_ASR	and my wife was fascinated at that that i had you know a stroke
kurland05b_275.899_1.1.wav_ASR	so one went to the hospital
kurland05b_277.016_4.1.wav_ASR	and you know they try it on cinderella
kurland05b_281.136_4.44.wav_ASR	but it was you know over three hours so the camera didn't work
kurland05b_293.567_4.82.wav_ASR	well i went to speech therapy and occupational therapy and physical therapy
kurland05b_298.403_8.73.wav_ASR	and the the p t and the occupational therapy probably went to a different place
kurland05b_307.193_2.73.wav_ASR	and now they you know
kurland05b_310.082_0.64.wav_ASR	okay
kurland05b_310.745_2.93.wav_ASR	you know a story about
kurland05b_313.825_2.57.wav_ASR	and i remember the there were a few words
kurland05b_318.388_3.05.wav_ASR	well i was kicked the ball better with my right hand than i was with my left hand
kurland05b_321.457_1.7.wav_ASR	so she said
kurland05b_323.705_0.63.wav_ASR	recovery
kurland05b_324.657_3.95.wav_ASR	and then the speech therapy must've been in there for probably a year
kurland05b_333.208_9.89.wav_ASR	and you know if i was like a three when i started you know i i may be come up to a seven or an eight year old
kurland05b_343.549_1.79.wav_ASR	it's a kind of plastic thing
kurland05b_346.177_4.96.wav_ASR	and that's at that time there you know i my speech therapy was still going on
kurland05b_352.43_0.71.wav_ASR	peanut butter
kurland05b_353.164_2.95.wav_ASR	you know so my i stopped talking a lot
kurland05b_356.174_4.04.wav_ASR	we're we're you know what i'm saying
kurland05b_360.291_2.51.wav_ASR	you know i never got a speech therapist
kurland05b_370.449_0.36.wav_ASR	yeah
kurland05b_373.581_7.66.wav_ASR	it it's it's better but you know i i don't feel the same way about it
kurland05b_381.259_2.16.wav_ASR	alright alright
kurland05b_383.436_2.84.wav_ASR	and that was you know yall tell firstnamej
kurland05b_386.57_0.47.wav_ASR	uhhuh
kurland05b_387.861_3.22.wav_ASR	you know i i was pretty good with myself you know
kurland05b_391.097_4.98.wav_ASR	when you know i i became pregnant you know the first time
kurland05b_396.1_1.46.wav_ASR	or i don't know
kurland05b_401.115_6.28.wav_ASR	well after i had the stroke i continued to work because my year of recovery
kurland05b_408.444_4.29.wav_ASR	and i went to a meeting of the group
kurland05b_413.53_1.25.wav_ASR	at least outside of school
kurland05b_414.87_1.34.wav_ASR	the peanut butter
kurland05b_416.983_7.74.wav_ASR	and anyway they had a a class on the computer you know talking about it and all that
kurland05b_425.712_2.42.wav_ASR	and anyway the guy has me in a wheelchair
kurland05b_428.562_3.89.wav_ASR	and they i couldn't answer the question in front of all my friends
kurland05b_432.845_1.68.wav_ASR	and here i was sposta be the exercise
kurland05b_435.581_2.4.wav_ASR	and it just all of a sudden
kurland05b_438.0_1.17.wav_ASR	that was really embarrassing for me
kurland05b_440.451_5.79.wav_ASR	you know i i i don't guess much as it has used to be
kurland05b_448.71_3.71.wav_ASR	just yesterday you know the two weeks ago
kurland05b_453.297_5.68.wav_ASR	so i hadta think of course you know the surgery at the time
kurland05b_459.001_5.15.wav_ASR	and you know i one of the three people was a good friend
kurland05b_465.42_4.07.wav_ASR	and you know they're done a long time ago
kurland05b_470.732_2.86.wav_ASR	and and finally i think it's the third time i've taken a class
kurland05b_473.683_3.87.wav_ASR	and you know some of these people were there for for a long time
kurland05b_478.908_4.73.wav_ASR	so you know it's not the same as it used to be
kurland05b_486.315_0.97.wav_ASR	but you know just look at it
kurland05b_487.3_0.41.wav_ASR	that's all
kurland05b_521.35_5.4.wav_ASR	you know i'm not the first story you know
kurland05b_528.086_12.14.wav_ASR	when i was in second grade you know a little kid so it was probably about eight years old i understood a conversation with her
kurland05b_541.171_8.04.wav_ASR	and anyway it was some kind of a conference put on by the university
kurland05b_549.936_8.21.wav_ASR	and anyway i wanted a trip for myself and my my two parents to a french town in the north of france
kurland05b_558.463_2.43.wav_ASR	it went through the window
kurland05b_562.292_2.8.wav_ASR	and my father you know he died
kurland05b_565.11_1.13.wav_ASR	when my husband died
kurland05b_566.959_0.5.wav_ASR	we got it
kurland05b_567.474_5.55.wav_ASR	and the guy that was a guy for they he died
kurland05b_573.948_2.22.wav_ASR	he he was sposta be a prince or something
kurland05b_577.382_0.79.wav_ASR	well i never forget that
kurland05b_578.302_2.27.wav_ASR	but it's been a lot of time
kurland05b_582.487_1.86.wav_ASR	you know take out a knife
kurland05b_584.365_5.0.wav_ASR	and you know and then it gave me something to do
kurland05b_589.647_1.44.wav_ASR	you know it's it's indiana
kurland05b_591.776_2.55.wav_ASR	like i said that's a long time ago
kurland05b_624.232_0.39.wav_ASR	okay
kurland05b_628.176_4.47.wav_ASR	well well firstnamed is playing soccer or kickball with the kids
kurland05b_632.7_2.8.wav_ASR	and he kicks the ball through the window
kurland05b_635.545_6.32.wav_ASR	and unfortunately he goes through the the window either his own or someone else's
kurland05b_642.769_3.78.wav_ASR	it lands in the and probably hits a window
kurland05b_646.929_1.83.wav_ASR	knocks over a lamp and smashes it down
kurland05b_649.915_2.18.wav_ASR	and the guy who owns the house is sitting there
kurland05b_653.528_0.75.wav_ASR	just a cup of coffee
kurland05b_655.706_1.96.wav_ASR	he looks outside
kurland05b_657.905_0.67.wav_ASR	it's on the phone

kurland05b_675.398_0.57.wav_ASR	you know what i said
kurland05b_688.437_3.84.wav_ASR	well again the first jenny's probably gonna die
kurland05b_692.452_0.73.wav_ASR	and this musta said
kurland05b_693.436_0.72.wav_ASR	take out the jelly
kurland05b_694.205_1.17.wav_ASR	well i was sposta be there

kurland05b_698.991_1.28.wav_ASR	well the umbrella home
kurland05b_701.547_4.48.wav_ASR	and his mother's right an interesting thing is she says
kurland05b_707.255_1.58.wav_ASR	and the jelly gets soggy again
kurland05b_709.681_0.62.wav_ASR	you come home
kurland05b_710.322_2.75.wav_ASR	and he was gone
kurland05b_713.094_1.1.wav_ASR	that was firstnamem's college
kurland05b_714.345_3.63.wav_ASR	and next time he goes to school it takes a long time
kurland05b_744.592_1.132.wav_ASR	you know what i mean
kurland05b_755.253_4.52.wav_ASR	well the little girl's probably trying to get the cat down
kurland05b_759.794_2.18.wav_ASR	and i thought that was a good one
kurland05b_761.996_4.72.wav_ASR	and the dog chased the cat up the tree
kurland05b_768.041_7.81.wav_ASR	and then her father or some older gentleman tries it on cinderella
kurland05b_776.416_4.18.wav_ASR	and then the ladder falls down from the tree so that he can get down
kurland05b_781.781_5.59.wav_ASR	then the fire department is coming with the second ladder to get the guy out of the tree
kurland05b_796.879_0.58.wav_ASR	oh no
kurland05b_803.106_0.41.wav_ASR	yeah
kurland05b_807.665_0.38.wav_ASR	now
kurland05b_815.154_0.57.wav_ASR	that's okay
kurland05b_909.402_3.36.wav_ASR	well once upon a time there was a girl named cinderella
kurland05b_913.675_7.88.wav_ASR	he had two sisters not very good looking and an evil stepmother
kurland05b_922.524_6.82.wav_ASR	and there was a ball or something you know a problem or something
kurland05b_930.118_7.16.wav_ASR	and the the mother and the two girls are happy ever after
kurland05b_938.355_5.11.wav_ASR	and they told cinderella i'll stay home with you know watch the flowers because it it's a lot of work
kurland05b_945.465_0.99.wav_ASR	so cinderella stayed home
kurland05b_946.474_3.95.wav_ASR	and and so far she found the dress that she was going to wear
kurland05b_950.444_4.35.wav_ASR	her something's not the magic that it used to be
kurland05b_955.569_3.66.wav_ASR	and she got to the the palace
kurland05b_960.256_15.48.wav_ASR	and in the meantime she took a carriage that was made out a pumpkin and that was transformed into a beautiful carriage
kurland05b_976.988_3.15.wav_ASR	my aphasia is gone
kurland05b_981.967_7.69.wav_ASR	and he's the the pumpkin or the the carriage turned to a pumpkin again
kurland05b_991.035_2.82.wav_ASR	so cinderella had me make a timepiece
kurland05b_994.22_9.66.wav_ASR	and you know she took off in the ball before midnight so she wouldn't turn into a pumpkin again
kurland05b_1004.309_1.67.wav_ASR	and then i guess she lost the slipper
kurland05b_1006.874_2.58.wav_ASR	and while she was there she was dancing with the hands of the dance
kurland05b_1009.716_4.87.wav_ASR	and they always the prince you know got a happy ending
kurland05b_1014.608_2.97.wav_ASR	and he liked her a lot
kurland05b_1017.86_5.95.wav_ASR	you know it had a
kurland05b_1024.992_3.069.wav_ASR	where we fit in the shoe will be the same
kurland05b_1028.833_4.409.wav_ASR	and they always cinderella fit into the slipper
kurland05b_1035.181_0.6.wav_ASR	they got married
kurland05b_1035.799_1.43.wav_ASR	and they lived happily ever after
kurland05b_1048.697_0.45.wav_ASR	okay
kurland05b_1055.422_0.45.wav_ASR	okay
kurland05b_1056.34_1.33.wav_ASR	take two pieces of bread
kurland05b_1059.379_1.51.wav_ASR	and you know lay on the table
kurland05b_1061.055_8.55.wav_ASR	and you put peanut butter and jelly on the bread
kurland05b_1070.403_1.97.wav_ASR	they put down the bread
kurland05b_1073.065_1.85.wav_ASR	that that's one of them
kurland05b_1074.939_11.48.wav_ASR	and then other half of the speech therapy because those make the difference in it you know
kurland05b_1086.976_1.86.wav_ASR	and lay that on another piece of bread
kurland05b_1088.915_1.73.wav_ASR	and i just slammed it together
kurland05b_1091.815_1.39.wav_ASR	and i cut it in half
kurland05b_1093.315_1.94.wav_ASR	and they say
kurland05b_1101.168_0.35.wav_ASR	you know
kurland08a_40.815_26.38.wav_ASR	and i don't use it that much so it's hard for me to judging myself by my own
kurland08a_81.459_20.65.wav_ASR	it was in march of two thousand and one and i can remember just a long time ago
kurland08a_103.448_4.89.wav_ASR	and my face is wet
kurland08a_110.013_11.93.wav_ASR	that's the only thing i remember
kurland08a_163.775_24.23.wav_ASR	and then i was there for four days or five and then i went to health south of the equator

71-1_56.18_2.36.wav_ASR	the first semester i was a junior
71-1_59.16_2.453.wav_ASR	we had classes for four days a week

71-1_165.44_2.1.wav_ASR	so we won't go to all the dance
71-1_174.46_3.52.wav_ASR	well i'd say it was irish because i met my wife
71-1_178.1_6.44.wav_ASR	my father's family was only two generations from immediate family
71-1_184.94_5.88.wav_ASR	and there in brownstone which is in the western part of philadelphia
71-1_191.32_5.02.wav_ASR	and so i actually meet with other cousins and stuff like that
71-1_196.572_2.608.wav_ASR	that's not sure what the exact relationship is
71-1_199.432_1.95.wav_ASR	but i met people that were part of my family
71-1_201.692_7.006.wav_ASR	and i older or third or fourth cousins that looked exactly like my father's kids
71-1_209.352_4.804.wav_ASR	oh yeah that was the little amount of spending money
71-1_236.89_0.84.wav_ASR	it comes and goes
71-1_238.25_4.65.wav_ASR	well i would say that the main problem with my language is that i can't remember
71-1_243.73_5.13.wav_ASR	as i said a few minutes ago i was talking about my stroke
71-1_249.84_4.21.wav_ASR	and what interesting is that it's the valves that i have in my heart
71-1_254.46_2.14.wav_ASR	and i could not say a word
71-1_257.12_1.089.wav_ASR	and i think i said a bird
71-1_258.58_0.629.wav_ASR	and then i said
71-1_259.68_6.89.wav_ASR	well i was really thinking in my brain how to walk around that or figure that out or something like that
71-1_267.01_2.96.wav_ASR	and i continue after that
71-1_270.27_1.84.wav_ASR	and i didn't accept that hospital
71-1_272.61_2.16.wav_ASR	well i better than i was
71-1_275.11_5.22.wav_ASR	well i still have difficulty with consonants
71-1_281.15_1.54.wav_ASR	and i still am
71-1_282.906_4.581.wav_ASR	well not that i haven't always been concerned about it
71-1_287.466_3.295.wav_ASR	and i do remember what it was like when i was peeing in the bathroom
71-1_291.106_1.62.wav_ASR	and people would look at me
71-1_293.566_0.577.wav_ASR	and then it was like
71-1_294.446_0.82.wav_ASR	what's their problem
71-1_295.586_5.857.wav_ASR	one they look puzzled a lot of times i'm pretty sure it's because i said something that i don't know
71-1_301.443_11.647.wav_ASR	so i'm still trying to work on explaining complicated things to people and trying to correct my own mistakes
71-1_313.523_6.04.wav_ASR	and i do continue mitzi speech a lot of the time
71-1_319.736_1.86.wav_ASR	so it's frustrating
71-1_321.916_8.864.wav_ASR	but i keep practicing it to the point that many people don't think i have aphasia until they see me
71-1_331.276_5.44.wav_ASR	so i can communicate but not the way that i useta do with people
71-1_347.09_0.959.wav_ASR	oh very much
71-1_348.131_1.199.wav_ASR	yeah i remember about it
71-1_350.191_0.82.wav_ASR	uhhuh
71-1_357.66_4.863.wav_ASR	well i didn't know that it was a stroke which i don't know
71-1_363.04_1.71.wav_ASR	and then i had one before that
71-1_364.78_1.964.wav_ASR	so how do i know what a stroke is
71-1_366.88_4.114.wav_ASR	and i was alert alert and awake
71-1_371.1_1.984.wav_ASR	it was january
71-1_373.42_4.0.wav_ASR	that was the day when i you know that's the day when the reason for my stroke
71-1_377.8_1.688.wav_ASR	well i don't hafta get up
71-1_379.52_2.533.wav_ASR	and i needta start working out again harder than i did before
71-1_382.16_0.893.wav_ASR	and i was at it again
71-1_384.16_2.555.wav_ASR	and i worked the hell out at it
71-1_386.84_1.385.wav_ASR	and i think i did eat it
71-1_388.82_3.88.wav_ASR	and my heart rate was up to like a hundred percent
71-1_393.18_0.64.wav_ASR	and i'm gonna go
71-1_394.24_0.819.wav_ASR	and we kicked this up
71-1_395.34_2.9.wav_ASR	and yeah i and i wasn't
71-1_398.62_0.92.wav_ASR	it wasn't fatal
71-1_400.16_11.482.wav_ASR	and i got off the elevator and had trouble at one more mile and then decided i would walk for two more miles to get home
71-1_412.0_1.26.wav_ASR	uhhuh
71-1_413.3_0.677.wav_ASR	but that was it
71-1_413.977_4.84.wav_ASR	and i thought i wanted to watch it because really like a movie
71-1_419.837_1.766.wav_ASR	what's what's wrong with me
71-1_422.137_2.144.wav_ASR	and again i had difficulty
71-1_425.157_2.023.wav_ASR	oh i just didn't feel good
71-1_427.66_7.131.wav_ASR	went home and had a thunderclap headache on my right side
71-1_434.94_0.52.wav_ASR	and i just said
71-1_435.94_1.381.wav_ASR	well i don't know what that means
71-1_437.76_2.145.wav_ASR	so i've kind of ignored it and just thought
71-1_440.66_2.93.wav_ASR	the next day i couldn't walk
71-1_443.78_1.7.wav_ASR	was trying to write a conference for me
71-1_445.86_0.64.wav_ASR	nothing would work
71-1_446.77_1.3.wav_ASR	and i couldn't do work
71-1_449.31_3.735.wav_ASR	so i went to get my head my hair cut and everything
71-1_453.11_3.247.wav_ASR	and i wanted to celebrate because i had a really good time
71-1_456.67_2.13.wav_ASR	but if you cancel it you hafta pay for it
71-1_459.29_1.889.wav_ASR	and my hair will be wet
71-1_461.93_0.942.wav_ASR	oh i can't
71-1_462.93_1.662.wav_ASR	and i live alone
71-1_464.592_2.463.wav_ASR	so i hadn't really talked to anybody in the house
71-1_467.512_1.658.wav_ASR	you know down in the thing
71-1_469.572_2.734.wav_ASR	and i couldn't tell her how i wanted to get my hair done
71-1_473.192_2.18.wav_ASR	and i couldn't say anything
71-1_476.352_4.42.wav_ASR	so i couldn't tell her that i've been married
71-1_481.512_1.76.wav_ASR	and i don't know what was going on
71-1_483.692_0.608.wav_ASR	and i was tired
71-1_484.66_2.06.wav_ASR	and she was knitting and sewing
71-1_486.78_1.691.wav_ASR	but she had no idea what i was talking about
71-1_489.8_0.46.wav_ASR	oh i see
71-1_490.62_1.01.wav_ASR	well something's wrong
71-1_492.54_1.8.wav_ASR	so i told her
71-1_494.62_0.3.wav_ASR	and i said
71-1_495.129_0.678.wav_ASR	why are you here
71-1_497.02_2.56.wav_ASR	so she luckily she didn't have high blood pressure
71-1_499.94_1.89.wav_ASR	but she cut her hair the way she wanted
71-1_502.08_0.3.wav_ASR	and i said
71-1_502.46_3.93.wav_ASR	you know i'd better go call a doctor because this doesn't look good to me
71-1_507.5_2.1.wav_ASR	so i i try to
71-1_510.16_4.24.wav_ASR	and i think this is something that must happen with people that has stroke is that they
71-1_516.46_3.62.wav_ASR	and i looked up the number that i was sposta call emergency services
71-1_520.22_1.589.wav_ASR	and this was already sixty plus twelve
71-1_522.35_2.64.wav_ASR	and it had all these steps
71-1_526.21_3.46.wav_ASR	if it's an immediate emergency go call nine one one
71-1_530.13_0.33.wav_ASR	and i thought
71-1_530.61_0.757.wav_ASR	that's it
71-1_531.59_3.737.wav_ASR	and i'm just gonna make an appointment and go into the emergency clinic
71-1_536.11_0.706.wav_ASR	and then it said
71-1_537.11_3.2.wav_ASR	if it's this situation call nine one one
71-1_540.703_4.014.wav_ASR	and if it's this situation call you know practice
71-1_545.023_2.16.wav_ASR	and if it's this situation call nine one one
71-1_548.083_3.82.wav_ASR	and apparently if you stayed on for two and a half months they found me
71-1_552.343_1.811.wav_ASR	real person will come on the scene
71-1_555.283_1.601.wav_ASR	but my head really hurts
71-1_557.243_0.593.wav_ASR	and i was just gone
71-1_557.903_1.16.wav_ASR	well this is what happened
71-1_559.46_2.24.wav_ASR	so i hung up the phone and said
71-1_561.9_1.13.wav_ASR	well i'll just get up to my room
71-1_563.38_2.36.wav_ASR	you know i'll see if anybody will ask me that
71-1_566.68_1.06.wav_ASR	but i told my wife
71-1_568.34_4.12.wav_ASR	and she she was very good
71-1_573.0_0.6.wav_ASR	you just say it
71-1_573.7_1.12.wav_ASR	don't sound like yourself
71-1_576.13_1.22.wav_ASR	you needta go take an umbrella
71-1_577.9_1.29.wav_ASR	look i'm gonna pare for an hour
71-1_579.24_0.78.wav_ASR	and it's just ridiculous
71-1_580.52_1.22.wav_ASR	yes yes
71-1_581.84_0.82.wav_ASR	and i just have a headache
71-1_582.9_2.28.wav_ASR	and i don't wanna spend that much
71-1_586.02_6.16.wav_ASR	and she and her partner they got married
71-1_592.48_0.8.wav_ASR	he's an engineer
71-1_593.56_2.263.wav_ASR	he's just finishing school again
71-1_596.04_2.585.wav_ASR	but she they called the fire department to help
71-1_598.625_1.419.wav_ASR	and and they said
71-1_601.165_2.74.wav_ASR	actually this is
71-1_604.725_1.16.wav_ASR	this is her sister
71-1_606.385_0.335.wav_ASR	and they said
71-1_607.54_1.23.wav_ASR	it sounds like she's having a stroke
71-1_609.285_2.315.wav_ASR	and she needs to get to the emergency room
71-1_613.76_1.04.wav_ASR	and and they said
71-1_614.845_1.205.wav_ASR	but she doesn't wanna go
71-1_616.36_0.52.wav_ASR	and they said
71-1_616.96_5.542.wav_ASR	all of a sudden i know is i'm living on my own again
71-1_623.14_4.643.wav_ASR	and i hear people running up the stairs outside my house
71-1_628.28_4.927.wav_ASR	and then just a little looking fireman is coming
71-1_633.62_2.12.wav_ASR	and i think it must be the university
71-1_636.04_0.645.wav_ASR	and i'm not sure why
71-1_637.365_1.928.wav_ASR	and i answered the phone
71-1_639.285_1.265.wav_ASR	and i told them
71-1_640.825_1.38.wav_ASR	well i didn't have it
71-1_642.545_1.252.wav_ASR	did i know what was going on
71-1_644.165_1.173.wav_ASR	but i couldn't talk
71-1_646.805_1.205.wav_ASR	you needta come with us right now
71-1_648.285_0.355.wav_ASR	and i said
71-1_648.745_0.913.wav_ASR	well no i'll take it
71-1_650.705_0.335.wav_ASR	and they said
71-1_651.417_0.908.wav_ASR	you can't drive
71-1_653.105_1.585.wav_ASR	well i'm gonna go to marriage to her
71-1_654.885_1.437.wav_ASR	oh you're gonna go this right here
71-1_656.32_0.62.wav_ASR	oh my gosh
71-1_657.32_0.817.wav_ASR	oh alright
71-1_658.28_2.28.wav_ASR	and let me get my coat and all that stuff
71-1_660.88_3.715.wav_ASR	yeah all of a sudden i got into the emergency room
71-1_664.74_1.961.wav_ASR	it was just this huge
71-1_667.8_1.86.wav_ASR	it was raining around and getting wet
71-1_670.22_6.1.wav_ASR	and all of a sudden they held me in for a cat scan and everything
71-1_676.5_1.02.wav_ASR	yeah you had a stroke
71-1_678.32_2.727.wav_ASR	so i asked the doctor
71-1_681.06_3.681.wav_ASR	and he showed me on the cat scan exactly what was going on
71-1_685.44_3.23.wav_ASR	and they got married
71-1_689.38_2.962.wav_ASR	so that's how i found out about it
71-1_692.75_6.56.wav_ASR	yeah i i really have had no issues what so far with my stroke
71-1_699.81_1.65.wav_ASR	my phone is dead
71-1_702.78_2.04.wav_ASR	and i just didn't know about it
71-1_705.03_0.95.wav_ASR	never had one again
71-1_706.88_1.18.wav_ASR	never had one
71-1_708.53_7.93.wav_ASR	but apparently if you get a really really bad headache that means you should probably go to the doctor
71-1_717.45_2.54.wav_ASR	oh i don't know if that gave you an idea
71-1_720.582_1.363.wav_ASR	it doesn't give you a lot of insight
71-1_722.34_8.435.wav_ASR	and if i'd originally right after i had the headache that could have been a stroke
71-1_731.3_3.77.wav_ASR	and at midnight the window of opportunity to leave
71-1_737.18_5.617.wav_ASR	but it wasn't a smear stroke not a hemorrhagic stroke
71-1_743.84_6.846.wav_ASR	and it they ultimately decided it was critical because they've not been able to find one yet
71-1_751.22_7.24.wav_ASR	all of my numbers are perfect numbers
71-1_758.94_0.8.wav_ASR	and i'm not dying
71-1_760.32_0.82.wav_ASR	and i don't smoke
71-1_762.02_1.88.wav_ASR	and i have a lot blood pressure
71-1_764.42_2.25.wav_ASR	everything lived happily ever after
71-1_767.76_1.39.wav_ASR	but i didn't enjoy having a stroke
71-1_769.54_2.64.wav_ASR	so something happened to me
71-1_772.78_3.16.wav_ASR	and in the hospital i got to watch some of that
71-1_776.46_0.954.wav_ASR	and it just
71-1_780.18_0.96.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
71-1_781.58_4.48.wav_ASR	yeah so yeah two years two and a half years
71-1_797.2_17.56.wav_ASR	well again and if i ever get to the point that i'm articulate enough about this i'm going to use my political science major and write a paper on it
71-1_814.772_2.553.wav_ASR	and i was given almost a year
71-1_817.552_3.086.wav_ASR	partially i think it was because of stroke
71-1_820.772_2.485.wav_ASR	and really medicine is a mixture
71-1_823.472_6.42.wav_ASR	so i should've been able to get the best type of help for me
71-1_830.372_0.477.wav_ASR	and i did it
71-1_830.849_4.78.wav_ASR	and the best i could get was we found two stepsisters
71-1_836.569_2.232.wav_ASR	one of them only specializes in that
71-1_839.189_1.351.wav_ASR	so i didn't work with him
71-1_840.909_0.92.wav_ASR	the other person
71-1_842.229_4.18.wav_ASR	and it was really one hour a week right there
71-1_847.59_16.523.wav_ASR	and basically because i am an accountant because that part of my brain wasn't interested in doing accounting and because that part of my brain wasn't able to do it
71-1_864.29_2.08.wav_ASR	and i hadta do a lot of things to get ahead
71-1_866.55_4.28.wav_ASR	and the speech therapist it wasn't perfect yet
71-1_871.09_0.612.wav_ASR	very difficult
71-1_872.39_3.118.wav_ASR	and she i mean she helped me a lot you know
71-1_875.61_2.902.wav_ASR	so i should be looking up on this particular day
71-1_878.63_2.25.wav_ASR	and i should be looking at the picture again
71-1_881.53_3.02.wav_ASR	and but she hadn't kept up with me
71-1_884.71_4.16.wav_ASR	but she hadn't learned about some of the most recent treatments for aphasia
71-1_889.53_7.52.wav_ASR	so basically what i did is i went back to exercise and physical therapy
71-1_897.35_2.7.wav_ASR	and i couldn't work out for three years
71-1_900.34_5.67.wav_ASR	and i could only walk because they were concerned that my physical ability had deteriorated
71-1_906.42_0.66.wav_ASR	you
71-1_909.64_1.189.wav_ASR	well i just hadta walk
71-1_911.14_1.081.wav_ASR	and i had a stroke
71-1_913.2_1.401.wav_ASR	it tested me for aphasia
71-1_914.74_3.28.wav_ASR	and i hadta wear this sweater for about three days
71-1_918.17_2.86.wav_ASR	but i don't have a phone either so
71-1_921.33_2.315.wav_ASR	but i focus on one thing
71-1_924.37_4.82.wav_ASR	really wasn't drinking much alcohol at all
71-1_930.27_1.38.wav_ASR	well i stopped to consider it
71-1_932.87_2.66.wav_ASR	and so now i'm back exercising it's much better
71-1_935.83_2.18.wav_ASR	and i'm really careful in terms of my speech
71-1_938.49_7.52.wav_ASR	and i really focus on immigration living in the united states
71-1_947.57_2.29.wav_ASR	and i right there
71-1_950.51_1.38.wav_ASR	and i learned everything
71-1_951.89_3.934.wav_ASR	well i'm trying to write an article which i hope to publish
71-1_955.824_20.3.wav_ASR	because that's maybe the hardest thing from my brain that i ever hadta do before the stroke or earlier is the reading and writing
71-1_976.405_1.819.wav_ASR	so i'm not done yet
71-1_978.345_9.56.wav_ASR	every day the news papers because i think some words are a way to communicate
71-1_988.605_2.865.wav_ASR	whether it's the phone or
71-1_991.665_2.454.wav_ASR	well i just needta learn how to say it
71-1_994.405_0.82.wav_ASR	laughing
71-1_995.479_4.388.wav_ASR	and i'll probably be able to say that a lot for a long time until i get better
71-1_999.919_4.279.wav_ASR	and then i'll miss firstnamem's presence in my life
71-1_1005.119_5.531.wav_ASR	but that's really all i know how to do is speaking and writing
71-1_1011.439_0.611.wav_ASR	and sleep
71-1_1012.379_2.191.wav_ASR	and i always
71-1_1014.87_2.86.wav_ASR	they've gone without it for a long time
71-1_1018.68_1.81.wav_ASR	you know if you stay late you're done
71-1_1020.89_3.12.wav_ASR	but you still hafta get up because you have a class or you can go home
71-1_1024.67_8.638.wav_ASR	well i try to make sure i always have at least eight or nine hours a day for work
71-1_1033.308_3.68.wav_ASR	and that seems to be something that i didn't need at all
71-1_1037.181_1.688.wav_ASR	now i really don't need it
71-1_1038.968_2.762.wav_ASR	but that's not right
71-1_1042.028_0.872.wav_ASR	still working
71-1_1043.248_1.404.wav_ASR	but i'm not able to tie
71-1_1045.089_3.024.wav_ASR	you can see what i would be like in normal times
71-1_1048.268_0.89.wav_ASR	and i got from a place
71-1_1049.328_0.769.wav_ASR	and i started talking
71-1_1050.288_0.602.wav_ASR	and people will be going
71-1_1051.388_0.52.wav_ASR	what's her name
71-1_1052.271_0.5.wav_ASR	yes
71-1_1054.451_1.998.wav_ASR	so maybe that's all
71-1_1056.791_0.58.wav_ASR	and i can do it
71-1_1058.051_3.74.wav_ASR	and i could teach through online teaching
71-1_1062.471_2.149.wav_ASR	but so far i'm just doing other things
71-1_1064.971_1.119.wav_ASR	but i did love teaching
71-1_1067.49_1.36.wav_ASR	well see if i can get back to work
71-1_1069.371_0.419.wav_ASR	and i don't know
71-1_1070.87_1.35.wav_ASR	and anyway so that's what happened
71-1_1072.81_4.64.wav_ASR	and i think doing it consistently is very helpful
71-1_1077.79_2.66.wav_ASR	and i just keep pushing myself to do different things
71-1_1081.13_6.08.wav_ASR	there's literally nothing that i'm not forced to speak at all
71-1_1087.51_0.909.wav_ASR	not finding myself
71-1_1088.69_2.265.wav_ASR	the first things i go through every single day
71-1_1091.81_2.36.wav_ASR	how do i do yoga again
71-1_1094.51_1.1.wav_ASR	and i think that's useful
71-1_1096.57_1.69.wav_ASR	and i i thought
71-1_1098.26_19.94.wav_ASR	and again i'm always looking at research all the other to the extent that my brain will be able to recover those language and cognitive abilities
71-1_1119.04_7.42.wav_ASR	well i spent a few months a right hand person with a stroke on the right side of the brain
71-1_1127.38_10.66.wav_ASR	but i mean other than the fact that it doesn't kill me for many clinical trials because they do care a little bit more
71-1_1138.248_3.801.wav_ASR	other than that i guess i just don't worry about it at all
71-1_1142.228_13.0.wav_ASR	and i'm just doing what i can to try to heal and return on neuroplasticity to be able to take care of myself
71-1_1155.48_9.755.wav_ASR	well i do understand that at my age in my sixties pittsburgh is less likely to be a stroke
71-1_1165.72_1.66.wav_ASR	so i said
71-1_1167.66_0.67.wav_ASR	we'll see what happens
71-1_1168.91_6.48.wav_ASR	well i just watch it every day this experience in work or this working for someone else
71-1_1175.93_2.077.wav_ASR	how it comes out and how it doesn't come out
71-1_1178.67_1.08.wav_ASR	well see you
71-1_1179.91_1.98.wav_ASR	well a lot of people don't know i have aphasia
71-1_1182.17_12.68.wav_ASR	and i like keeping it that way because the there's a disability attendant at having a disability for me
71-1_1196.42_8.392.wav_ASR	well i miss people just think i missed very badly
71-1_1205.08_4.784.wav_ASR	well i i'm rather just see if i can say something
71-1_1210.7_3.66.wav_ASR	so yeah very few people know that i have that condition
71-1_1214.592_1.416.wav_ASR	the family members no
71-1_1216.008_3.437.wav_ASR	but i don't tell anyone about it
71-1_1219.768_1.825.wav_ASR	that's just trying to figure it out
71-1_1242.33_1.36.wav_ASR	and it should be something interesting
71-1_1246.83_4.6.wav_ASR	well you know i have a stroke
71-1_1251.764_12.94.wav_ASR	something that i would say is being very important for me was working with firstnamem firstnamem
71-1_1266.024_2.112.wav_ASR	well i'm very close to it
71-1_1268.136_3.957.wav_ASR	well i met firstnamee about ten years ago
71-1_1273.036_2.404.wav_ASR	and probably more fifteen years at that point
71-1_1276.336_2.78.wav_ASR	and i was teaching at an elementary school
71-1_1279.476_1.38.wav_ASR	and i invited her to
71-1_1280.996_6.4.wav_ASR	was the issue of the national students organization because my research is on this topic
71-1_1287.93_7.06.wav_ASR	and i had invited her to come and speak in the church
71-1_1295.79_0.926.wav_ASR	and she came down
71-1_1297.17_2.48.wav_ASR	and we hit it off with her
71-1_1300.24_3.96.wav_ASR	and she was one of the most reliable people in my life
71-1_1304.73_5.19.wav_ASR	and she was the oldest in a family of four
71-1_1310.55_3.42.wav_ASR	and she grew up on the miami reservation outside of florida
71-1_1315.01_5.11.wav_ASR	the first person to get a college degree from the university
71-1_1321.04_3.68.wav_ASR	and she became the first female firefighter
71-1_1325.92_7.08.wav_ASR	and in the last ten years i would say a lot of progress
71-1_1333.92_3.12.wav_ASR	and i generally because as she's getting older she's going to die
71-1_1337.32_0.87.wav_ASR	so she lets me go
71-1_1339.05_7.74.wav_ASR	and you go to different events or different hearing in which i was able to do that
71-1_1347.67_7.05.wav_ASR	and what i've learned from hanging out with this woman who is intelligent and everything
71-1_1355.21_1.06.wav_ASR	yeah
71-1_1356.984_2.503.wav_ASR	he doesn't see that one yet
71-1_1359.704_1.4.wav_ASR	he has trouble reading any of it
71-1_1361.57_3.02.wav_ASR	but she has me right speech and everything
71-1_1365.124_1.586.wav_ASR	and she gets up and presents to me
71-1_1366.71_12.02.wav_ASR	and she refuses to to listen to me
71-1_1379.45_3.74.wav_ASR	and she will find away to powder all around
71-1_1384.07_3.535.wav_ASR	and she gets things done that other people have been doing
71-1_1387.89_9.96.wav_ASR	and why i see this is important is my own mother is very positive and very nice to me
71-1_1398.43_12.315.wav_ASR	and hanging out with firstnamel i have learned a great deal about what it means to be a poor woman not to worry about money
71-1_1411.09_1.635.wav_ASR	and just go
71-1_1412.95_0.663.wav_ASR	so i say your toothbrush
71-1_1414.29_1.84.wav_ASR	and press your tongue back
71-1_1416.263_8.47.wav_ASR	and push every lower that you can leave later to be able to get things done
71-1_1424.733_14.14.wav_ASR	so working with firstnamee over the past couple of years we've been able to stop a mind from firstnamel which would have been situated on the banks of the river
71-1_1440.7_6.776.wav_ASR	so she has been my insurance in terms of what i was able to do
71-1_1447.78_1.68.wav_ASR	yeah that's a really good one
71-1_1449.92_2.26.wav_ASR	so there's that's the way it is
71-1_1452.86_0.96.wav_ASR	and i thought
71-1_1454.02_6.652.wav_ASR	two she's been an organizer for me i think to help me with my job
71-1_1514.123_7.78.wav_ASR	well i mean it looks like a boy who's playing with the soccer ball
71-1_1522.3_7.984.wav_ASR	and he's pretty just on his own probably in his yard because this is something that happens to him a lot
71-1_1530.81_8.77.wav_ASR	and he kicked the ball maybe a little bit too far past the window
71-1_1540.7_3.8.wav_ASR	and it broke into the window and hit a lamp
71-1_1545.58_2.64.wav_ASR	and unfortunately he died
71-1_1549.0_11.31.wav_ASR	and the ball came through the window right next to the chair where the man was sitting
71-1_1561.7_4.32.wav_ASR	so he's obviously really upset about this because he didn't get it
71-1_1566.34_1.16.wav_ASR	and the glass is broken
71-1_1568.22_1.04.wav_ASR	and it's in his head
71-1_1569.74_1.088.wav_ASR	and it shouldn't have happened
71-1_1571.64_7.02.wav_ASR	and so he grapples the chair looks out the window to find the cookie who came in
71-1_1578.75_3.64.wav_ASR	now they're going to be some kind of
71-1_1582.51_3.18.wav_ASR	he's gonna need some recommendations that are made for him
71-1_1585.938_20.64.wav_ASR	he looks like he's about ready to head over grab over the phone to try to figure out how the window would be paid for how he would get his apartment and the problem that the neighbor was going to pay for
71-1_1623.92_0.5.wav_ASR	what's her name
71-1_1624.855_4.46.wav_ASR	well it looks as if this slipper
71-1_1630.595_1.88.wav_ASR	that's a nice one
71-1_1632.686_1.727.wav_ASR	hard actually it could be gone
71-1_1635.675_3.5.wav_ASR	and i can't decide if it's male or female
71-1_1639.515_3.031.wav_ASR	it's it's a very nice place
71-1_1643.288_9.44.wav_ASR	they is getting ready to head out to the library somewhere in the town
71-1_1653.76_5.85.wav_ASR	and their mother looked at her and said
71-1_1660.248_1.642.wav_ASR	you know i think we're gonna see some kids
71-1_1662.48_1.17.wav_ASR	you might need the umbrella
71-1_1664.82_1.11.wav_ASR	but this child said
71-1_1666.34_1.55.wav_ASR	don't need an umbrella
71-1_1668.44_1.2.wav_ASR	and i mean this is ridiculous
71-1_1669.94_0.6.wav_ASR	it's not gonna rain
71-1_1670.78_1.68.wav_ASR	and i don't really care about getting it
71-1_1672.82_0.87.wav_ASR	you know i don't
71-1_1674.76_0.73.wav_ASR	and i'm not so good
71-1_1675.74_1.68.wav_ASR	don't melt when the water is on
71-1_1678.28_1.97.wav_ASR	so this this triangle
71-1_1680.78_0.88.wav_ASR	and i'm leaving anyway
71-1_1681.66_1.72.wav_ASR	okay this jelly was on the other hand
71-1_1683.529_1.775.wav_ASR	it immediately began to rain
71-1_1686.38_1.31.wav_ASR	all of a sudden she said
71-1_1688.02_4.78.wav_ASR	wait i'm getting raindrops on my head
71-1_1693.33_1.4.wav_ASR	and i'm getting really wet
71-1_1695.36_1.22.wav_ASR	and this is not
71-1_1697.22_2.14.wav_ASR	didn't understand that it was getting in my head
71-1_1700.24_4.96.wav_ASR	so i immediately hated it back because it was raining much harder than it was before
71-1_1706.08_0.654.wav_ASR	laughing
71-1_1706.84_0.896.wav_ASR	so i went to my mother
71-1_1708.14_1.485.wav_ASR	and i just looked at her
71-1_1710.54_2.22.wav_ASR	of course knew that i was
71-1_1713.18_11.1.wav_ASR	the mother immediately understood that while it was very difficult for this child to ask for it or to understand what was going on
71-1_1725.08_5.08.wav_ASR	they did make clear that they were gonna leave an umbrella if they were gonna do something
71-1_1730.64_3.56.wav_ASR	so the mother then gave him a umbrella
71-1_1734.68_10.14.wav_ASR	and they went back on their way with an umbrella remembering at this point that maybe mother's actually no longer there
71-1_1761.65_0.5.wav_ASR	yeah
71-1_1762.547_29.94.wav_ASR	well what happened is that the cat that falls to the tree and becomes very clear that it didn't want to get off the tree but no longer knew how to get back in the tree
71-1_1800.778_0.579.wav_ASR	help me
71-1_1802.158_0.382.wav_ASR	me
71-1_1802.54_6.1.wav_ASR	and the little girl is obviously just really enjoying about the cat
71-1_1808.838_1.772.wav_ASR	and she's very worried about getting her cat down
71-1_1811.358_5.082.wav_ASR	so she began by going to her father's house
71-1_1816.78_4.1.wav_ASR	can you please help me get the cat out of the tree
71-1_1820.94_4.437.wav_ASR	and the
71-1_1825.6_0.417.wav_ASR	four girls
71-1_1826.1_18.22.wav_ASR	and he grabbed his ladder and climbed up the tree and climbed up to the the limb where the cat was sitting
71-1_1845.67_8.6.wav_ASR	he also included kick off the ladder which then puts him back in a situation where he can't go anywhere
71-1_1855.03_5.868.wav_ASR	so at this point the dog is now barking because the dog wants the man to come down
71-1_1861.6_10.368.wav_ASR	the barking of the dog is making it more difficult for the cat to be inside the tree
71-1_1872.9_8.052.wav_ASR	so the little girl is still really dressed because her children are going to school
71-1_1880.952_2.68.wav_ASR	that's a sentimental period for me
71-1_1883.772_0.899.wav_ASR	make that all the time
71-1_1885.192_3.057.wav_ASR	is really wants her cat to be back
71-1_1888.249_17.88.wav_ASR	so they called the fire department to come down and not just rescue the cat but also rescue the father since he now needs a ladder
71-1_1906.179_13.419.wav_ASR	but it doesn't actually show that the father was really trying to do what everybody wanted him to do in terms of helping with the kids
71-1_1939.75_0.39.wav_ASR	shut up
71-1_2104.158_2.744.wav_ASR	oh i'll keep the femur corticosteroid
71-1_2107.478_3.16.wav_ASR	well i'll be the next time you know
71-1_2113.118_0.492.wav_ASR	yeah
71-1_2113.85_8.89.wav_ASR	and cinderella is the daughter
71-1_2123.66_2.76.wav_ASR	her mother has has died
71-1_2127.23_2.66.wav_ASR	and so the two of them are happy
71-1_2131.04_13.9.wav_ASR	and the her father decides that it would be really helpful for his daughter if he received an invitation to a ball
71-1_2146.02_1.74.wav_ASR	so he met this
71-1_2149.12_2.03.wav_ASR	and i don't know that we've ever heard from her
71-1_2151.74_3.0.wav_ASR	but anyway other wise not so good
71-1_2155.58_6.48.wav_ASR	made very clear that she would be a wonderful person
71-1_2162.44_1.851.wav_ASR	and she also had two daughters of her own
71-1_2165.48_1.34.wav_ASR	oh they
71-1_2167.42_10.34.wav_ASR	and unfortunately the way that cinderella goes to the ball
71-1_2178.36_5.417.wav_ASR	and she was not treated the same way that the stepdaughters were
71-1_2183.777_4.48.wav_ASR	and in step she was used as a a servant
71-1_2188.336_5.469.wav_ASR	and i have no idea where her father is in this whole picture and why he's not doing anything
71-1_2194.037_3.593.wav_ASR	but maybe he's traveling or he's gone to school
71-1_2197.83_17.72.wav_ASR	but he's left the management of his daughter to the stepmother who treats her very badly doesn't treat her the same as she used to be
71-1_2216.67_10.5.wav_ASR	so she eventually becomes the maid to these two stepsisters and cinderella
71-1_2228.39_5.92.wav_ASR	but she's a very very sweet girl
71-1_2235.23_16.92.wav_ASR	and she's found a way to also have happiness and stability relationships with the animals because that's one of her jobs is to help the people
71-1_2252.39_1.84.wav_ASR	so she sings and
71-1_2255.14_0.93.wav_ASR	they love her
71-1_2256.32_5.39.wav_ASR	and she's close to the the horses and everything
71-1_2262.1_9.26.wav_ASR	and she dreams about being in a better situation where she's loved and is treated with kindness and everything
71-1_2271.67_11.59.wav_ASR	well she's also quite beautiful which is certainly one of the reasons why the stepsisters are so mean to her
71-1_2284.39_18.53.wav_ASR	well this is going on in this household the king has made it clear to his son that it's time for him to be married
71-1_2303.08_7.52.wav_ASR	and he'd like to hand down the key to cinderella
71-1_2311.32_1.88.wav_ASR	but first his son has too
71-1_2313.84_2.509.wav_ASR	and he doesn't really know
71-1_2316.62_1.587.wav_ASR	he's not interested in anything
71-1_2318.34_1.38.wav_ASR	you're not dating anybody
71-1_2320.22_3.01.wav_ASR	but the plan is that this is his father
71-1_2324.16_3.094.wav_ASR	so it was kind of like the prince harry of england
71-1_2327.3_3.0.wav_ASR	the fireman is not there
71-1_2331.06_5.74.wav_ASR	but in any case the plan is that there's gonna be a journaling group
71-1_2336.832_13.545.wav_ASR	and all of the elementary which i guess miles away from this dance is supposed to show up at this dance
71-1_2350.732_4.303.wav_ASR	and again we'll not get into the medical category of how to say it
71-1_2356.58_2.034.wav_ASR	finally the word gave me
71-1_2359.36_6.948.wav_ASR	and the two stepsisters are just really excited about this invitation because they can go
71-1_2366.94_9.235.wav_ASR	because their mother had married cinderella's father who makes a fair income for her
71-1_2376.175_11.163.wav_ASR	well they can really get dressed up to go to this dance and see if they could attract the prince
71-1_2388.615_1.676.wav_ASR	the cinderella wants to go
71-1_2390.815_3.322.wav_ASR	well she also reads about this that that is going on
71-1_2394.137_3.18.wav_ASR	and that she knows she's eligible because she's the right one
71-1_2397.537_6.18.wav_ASR	and i guess she's of that nationality or whatever type of person she is
71-1_2404.5_6.33.wav_ASR	but her stepmother kind of makes clear that no she's not going to go
71-1_2411.78_5.16.wav_ASR	he's not gonna be able to go to stores and buy clothes the way he used to
71-1_2417.82_2.25.wav_ASR	so she tries to make something happen
71-1_2420.4_3.38.wav_ASR	and she tries to take the medicines and the ragets that are related to it
71-1_2424.24_4.62.wav_ASR	he looks up how to make them another one
71-1_2429.36_1.08.wav_ASR	that was on paper a lot
71-1_2430.56_1.38.wav_ASR	oh i think that's what was happening
71-1_2432.61_1.33.wav_ASR	and she comes up with the idea
71-1_2434.24_1.5.wav_ASR	and of course she looks amazing
71-1_2436.71_9.244.wav_ASR	and i guess we're pretty and pink with a firstnamem firstnamer firstnamer
71-1_2446.2_1.78.wav_ASR	oh this is not
71-1_2449.65_1.12.wav_ASR	this is cinderella
71-1_2450.992_2.458.wav_ASR	so her mother last at home
71-1_2453.57_1.49.wav_ASR	we're not going out with those kids
71-1_2455.45_2.61.wav_ASR	and her stepsisters miserable
71-1_2458.95_2.32.wav_ASR	and she's out in the barn by herself
71-1_2462.19_9.66.wav_ASR	and all of a sudden this fairy godmother shows up and says
71-1_2472.03_2.42.wav_ASR	and i wish i could go to the ball
71-1_2475.65_12.128.wav_ASR	and she the reason that the fairy godmother is showing up is because she knows that cinderella needs to go to the ball
71-1_2488.53_2.041.wav_ASR	and she cares about everybody
71-1_2490.87_1.674.wav_ASR	and she does things for everybody to do
71-1_2492.544_4.96.wav_ASR	and because of the personality of her heart she decided to stay
71-1_2498.584_2.36.wav_ASR	so she uses her magic wand
71-1_2502.18_6.324.wav_ASR	and she not only creates a dress for her that is beautiful
71-1_2509.124_2.72.wav_ASR	you can go to the offices with me
71-1_2511.9_14.753.wav_ASR	but she also transfers the mice into horses and the pumpkin to become a carriage to be able to go to the ball
71-1_2526.84_2.1.wav_ASR	and she can ride in style
71-1_2529.78_4.64.wav_ASR	so cinderella is very very happy about it
71-1_2534.78_0.88.wav_ASR	and her grandmother said
71-1_2535.86_5.98.wav_ASR	remember this only last this dream will only last until midnight
71-1_2542.26_4.463.wav_ASR	at midnight your dress will go back to the way it was
71-1_2546.723_5.94.wav_ASR	your forces will be transferred to another school
71-1_2554.163_6.318.wav_ASR	and the code will be transmitted back in the hospital
71-1_2561.13_0.573.wav_ASR	and she said
71-1_2561.943_0.442.wav_ASR	so i know it
71-1_2562.423_0.792.wav_ASR	thank you very much
71-1_2563.463_3.157.wav_ASR	so she goes to the dance
71-1_2567.38_17.24.wav_ASR	and of course because she is so elderly and shows up with this really real tired type of care for cinderella
71-1_2584.975_2.916.wav_ASR	the the put man opens the door
71-1_2588.095_0.812.wav_ASR	help her come in
71-1_2589.635_0.812.wav_ASR	and she watches in the window
71-1_2590.635_2.32.wav_ASR	and immediately the prince just said
71-1_2593.435_0.658.wav_ASR	it's like that
71-1_2594.515_2.3.wav_ASR	he's been struck by lightning
71-1_2597.575_1.165.wav_ASR	who's the one i wanna be with
71-1_2598.975_1.165.wav_ASR	and he hits over the window
71-1_2600.475_2.06.wav_ASR	there's an incident
71-1_2604.46_2.0.wav_ASR	he dances with her the internet
71-1_2606.82_5.16.wav_ASR	he's pretty clear that maybe at this point marriage is not the worst thing in the world
71-1_2613.19_4.0.wav_ASR	and he's an firstnamel at this point in time
71-1_2617.56_0.34.wav_ASR	and she said
71-1_2618.12_0.46.wav_ASR	well i got a job
71-1_2618.76_0.34.wav_ASR	and he said
71-1_2619.22_1.32.wav_ASR	you know stick around
71-1_2620.94_0.6.wav_ASR	and i got off
71-1_2622.58_0.6.wav_ASR	and cinderella
71-1_2624.18_1.12.wav_ASR	and she said
71-1_2625.6_0.71.wav_ASR	oh i gotta get out
71-1_2626.5_0.52.wav_ASR	well i gotta go
71-1_2627.3_5.8.wav_ASR	and she runs away at about two or three minutes to midnight and goes home
71-1_2633.26_1.166.wav_ASR	and i i got this curtsy
71-1_2634.56_0.786.wav_ASR	and i got to go away
71-1_2635.38_1.167.wav_ASR	and she races away
71-1_2637.7_2.81.wav_ASR	all of a sudden she's she's a good witch
71-1_2640.94_0.44.wav_ASR	so she's out
71-1_2641.38_4.57.wav_ASR	way but all the since he sees that one of her shoes has been found
71-1_2646.16_0.98.wav_ASR	glass slipper
71-1_2647.86_2.174.wav_ASR	and so he picks it up
71-1_2650.2_3.24.wav_ASR	that's all he's got of her is this glass slipper
71-1_2654.1_2.56.wav_ASR	so he goes back to his father and says
71-1_2657.28_1.28.wav_ASR	oh i'll marry someone
71-1_2658.86_1.868.wav_ASR	there's only one woman i want to marry
71-1_2660.728_1.516.wav_ASR	and she's the one i wanna meet
71-1_2662.968_4.68.wav_ASR	and all i have is this clue that her foot will fit into the slipper
71-1_2668.928_2.54.wav_ASR	the start advertising around the country
71-1_2672.608_7.36.wav_ASR	one that foot will fit into these slippers the prince will consent to marry cinderella
71-1_2680.85_7.16.wav_ASR	so oh my god all the stepsisters who you know they were enrolled in the class
71-1_2688.27_2.82.wav_ASR	but they pretty sure they get their feet into this slipper
71-1_2692.05_1.6.wav_ASR	he one of the internet
71-1_2694.54_19.21.wav_ASR	and and of course at this point cinderella's back doing her work taking care of the children one again just disturbing and annoying cinderella
71-1_2714.59_1.81.wav_ASR	so the prince starts driving around
71-1_2716.91_4.25.wav_ASR	and it's this really disney sort of thing that i remember
71-1_2721.43_10.724.wav_ASR	people are running out taking off their shoes and seeing if their feet will fit into this slipper which is apparently designed specifically for cinderella
71-1_2733.67_1.9.wav_ASR	and he stands up and he stops at that point
71-1_2735.77_6.34.wav_ASR	he's really disturbed at this point because he hasn't yet found a woman who fit into the slipper
71-1_2743.01_1.095.wav_ASR	he stops at this point
71-1_2744.37_2.793.wav_ASR	all of the stepsisters do everything they can
71-1_2747.29_3.08.wav_ASR	but their feet are just too big or too long
71-1_2750.71_0.798.wav_ASR	it's not working
71-1_2751.632_3.22.wav_ASR	and then all of a sudden i thought
71-1_2755.261_2.278.wav_ASR	he's just about ready to go to school
71-1_2757.592_1.74.wav_ASR	all of a sudden he sees a movie
71-1_2760.172_5.59.wav_ASR	and he sees this other woman like the maid who's doing everything
71-1_2766.572_0.428.wav_ASR	and he said
71-1_2767.252_0.588.wav_ASR	don't hurt
71-1_2768.83_1.36.wav_ASR	and the stepmother said
71-1_2770.312_0.798.wav_ASR	oh she's not
71-1_2771.5_0.97.wav_ASR	two years ago
71-1_2773.43_1.84.wav_ASR	and she looks at me
71-1_2775.92_5.43.wav_ASR	and he the prince just has this strange feeling about her
71-1_2781.92_1.44.wav_ASR	how i like to have her come in
71-1_2783.78_7.311.wav_ASR	and i like to see if her feet will fit in the slipper
71-1_2791.091_2.035.wav_ASR	and so she comes back
71-1_2793.371_0.92.wav_ASR	and she's a nice
71-1_2794.711_3.639.wav_ASR	you know she's been working in the kitchen and all that
71-1_2798.931_6.2.wav_ASR	and she's you know not looking anywhere like the princess person that hadta go away
71-1_2805.87_0.8.wav_ASR	but she came back
71-1_2806.831_0.759.wav_ASR	and she sat down
71-1_2808.51_3.56.wav_ASR	the prince put the slipper on cinderella
71-1_2812.99_1.08.wav_ASR	and it fits
71-1_2814.73_0.98.wav_ASR	and then he looked at it
71-1_2815.71_22.48.wav_ASR	and what was remarkable is that he had shown the first time he met her to see that it was exactly the same person even if she was clearly not a good person
71-1_2839.43_15.337.wav_ASR	so they live happily after until just like princess cinderella because she was a little girl
71-1_2854.767_18.19.wav_ASR	and he hadta round his crown and go to another continent and then start delivering medicine not less efficient
71-1_2872.957_0.84.wav_ASR	alright
71-1_2874.864_1.272.wav_ASR	oh my god
71-1_2900.37_0.5.wav_ASR	okay
71-1_2905.61_1.0.wav_ASR	oh okay
71-1_2910.67_11.58.wav_ASR	and an interesting thing about clocks to me recently is that they're not always accurate
71-1_2923.03_2.831.wav_ASR	and i just turned sixty one
71-1_2926.39_2.52.wav_ASR	and so i had never experienced anything like that
71-1_2929.05_5.28.wav_ASR	and i thought it was my university
71-1_2935.52_1.03.wav_ASR	and i walked in
71-1_2936.75_0.57.wav_ASR	and i sat down
71-1_2937.65_2.34.wav_ASR	the nurse is checking my blood pressure
71-1_2940.41_4.62.wav_ASR	you know the my heart rate raised my pulse and everything
71-1_2945.73_3.06.wav_ASR	and then she handed me a piece of paper and a pen and said
71-1_2948.98_1.34.wav_ASR	and i like you to drop a slipper
71-1_2951.06_1.01.wav_ASR	you know what i mean
71-1_2953.58_0.57.wav_ASR	and she said
71-1_2954.34_3.38.wav_ASR	because i i want to see what kind of picture you have
71-1_2958.32_2.76.wav_ASR	so it seems to me
71-1_2961.62_1.027.wav_ASR	but i did it anyway
71-1_2963.0_0.93.wav_ASR	oh i do this
71-1_2964.52_9.32.wav_ASR	and i knew how to handle a picture apparently with a clock which is very complicated
71-1_2974.0_0.89.wav_ASR	and then you put down the jelly
71-1_2975.14_0.66.wav_ASR	and you put the jelly
71-1_2975.98_0.71.wav_ASR	and they put the nurse in
71-1_2976.74_8.82.wav_ASR	and then you fill the number so that everything is located where it should be in the center of the room
71-1_2986.12_3.09.wav_ASR	and then i hadta draw the pictures of two girls
71-1_2990.32_1.08.wav_ASR	and i finished
71-1_2991.6_0.4.wav_ASR	and i said
71-1_2992.42_1.46.wav_ASR	oh is this what you said
71-1_2994.75_4.17.wav_ASR	or did you want to just look at what you have on the wall that's right in front of me
71-1_2999.82_0.95.wav_ASR	and she said
71-1_3001.11_2.02.wav_ASR	well you have this slipper
71-1_3003.49_0.32.wav_ASR	and she says
71-1_3004.28_1.87.wav_ASR	wasn't initially a disability
71-1_3006.254_13.939.wav_ASR	that when you're sixty five and you go in for a appointment a a sorry when you go to see a an engineer for an annual checkup it's hard
71-1_3020.834_0.477.wav_ASR	and i said
71-1_3021.514_2.193.wav_ASR	one point will they stop doing it
71-1_3023.76_9.43.wav_ASR	because while i did enjoy grow up with the you know the round sock it's hard for me to talk
71-1_3033.8_1.68.wav_ASR	everything i do is different
71-1_3035.807_16.95.wav_ASR	so what happens at what century will they decide that this is not the way to show that you do not have dementia or whatever and that you should be able to communicate
71-1_3053.5_2.36.wav_ASR	well anyway if i do it i'm not gonna say it
71-1_3056.16_6.11.wav_ASR	well i'm just gonna it maybe i'll just mess with them and just put some different stuff in there
71-1_3062.88_3.78.wav_ASR	you know i have my p j or something like that
71-1_3066.9_2.818.wav_ASR	but anyway it's it's a test for me
71-1_3069.718_3.888.wav_ASR	and i found it really irritating all the time
71-1_3074.018_3.915.wav_ASR	and it's it's gonna be ugly very soon
71-1_3078.438_1.048.wav_ASR	yeah i can't
71-1_3084.638_1.963.wav_ASR	well let me see
71-1_3091.487_18.88.wav_ASR	one of the things i useta do when my daughter was younger is usually the first week in january we would go out to see her
71-1_3110.83_14.71.wav_ASR	and what the egg watch is more of a unicorn rider there's one place that in january the eggs are all broken
71-1_3125.67_0.72.wav_ASR	they're coming back
71-1_3126.63_1.247.wav_ASR	they're going south there's somebody
71-1_3127.877_5.666.wav_ASR	but they all show up in this lake for four days
71-1_3134.157_8.44.wav_ASR	and so what people do is they have groups the obituary society and other groups that she works with
71-1_3144.23_4.65.wav_ASR	and we watch the the birds the eagles and the hawks
71-1_3149.19_1.113.wav_ASR	it's really really close
71-1_3150.45_1.46.wav_ASR	you can see the man
71-1_3152.49_1.454.wav_ASR	and you can see them with their mother
71-1_3154.33_2.28.wav_ASR	and there's just so many of them at one time
71-1_3157.17_2.038.wav_ASR	it was sunny day we have a lot of fun
71-1_3159.43_4.8.wav_ASR	but we don't necessarily see ball the girl
71-1_3164.36_1.23.wav_ASR	it's much more raining
71-1_3166.48_4.788.wav_ASR	that's something that we did for a number of years
71-1_3171.36_2.94.wav_ASR	even when she was thirty and wasn't really talking to me at all
71-1_3174.98_2.763.wav_ASR	we always had fun on the beach
71-1_3177.96_0.725.wav_ASR	we would show it
71-1_3179.02_3.122.wav_ASR	the first she dressed really well because it's gonna be a big one
71-1_3182.59_3.58.wav_ASR	we would go to the banks one day
71-1_3186.63_2.08.wav_ASR	we would wait for the emails to come
71-1_3188.91_1.44.wav_ASR	we would watch them for a long time
71-1_3190.65_2.38.wav_ASR	and then we would go half and half
71-1_3193.31_2.86.wav_ASR	and she would talk you know during that time
71-1_3196.61_2.19.wav_ASR	when we were home i don't know
71-1_3199.11_0.88.wav_ASR	oh god she's my name
71-1_3200.21_0.568.wav_ASR	knock on the table
71-1_3200.778_1.896.wav_ASR	long time ago i talked to my dad
71-1_3202.738_13.726.wav_ASR	but there was always that one period even in those very very difficult years that my daughter always talked to me a lot
71-1_3216.464_5.16.wav_ASR	so that's one of the things that i would think of when i think of a story
71-1_3227.38_1.01.wav_ASR	what what was the word again
71-1_3230.244_2.56.wav_ASR	well i don't know if you wanna hear that story
71-1_3233.039_0.485.wav_ASR	uhhuh
71-1_3233.991_2.78.wav_ASR	well i don't know
71-1_3236.777_13.094.wav_ASR	well i can tell you a recent one that will really not be right there or anything like that
71-1_3250.021_10.775.wav_ASR	and i'll talk about something i did last summer which just and since my stroke i've been doing a lot more
71-1_3260.881_2.569.wav_ASR	and i'm much more tired than i useta be
71-1_3263.61_5.251.wav_ASR	but i'm still trying to push my boundaries to find out exactly what's going on
71-1_3268.93_1.28.wav_ASR	and how much can i say
71-1_3270.29_1.827.wav_ASR	and how long can i do that
71-1_3272.13_3.6.wav_ASR	and how many hours a day can i you know do that
71-1_3275.741_2.789.wav_ASR	and so i work with this guy
71-1_3279.53_5.7.wav_ASR	and we were having an event in northern massachusetts off the state line
71-1_3285.397_2.48.wav_ASR	and it's a group is called the
71-1_3289.337_1.68.wav_ASR	we do with firstnamee firstnamed
71-1_3291.677_3.779.wav_ASR	so i i hit up for this wall with a knife
71-1_3295.737_1.06.wav_ASR	and i hadta get up
71-1_3296.957_5.26.wav_ASR	think i left town at five to get up there
71-1_3302.331_5.519.wav_ASR	we had an event all day long and talking and you know different people
71-1_3307.891_1.32.wav_ASR	and it was really really hot
71-1_3310.051_3.538.wav_ASR	and i was ready to drive home by myself
71-1_3314.151_2.269.wav_ASR	and about an hour later
71-1_3317.011_2.559.wav_ASR	it's about three and a half hours
71-1_3319.71_2.98.wav_ASR	and i decided i can't drive anymore
71-1_3323.47_1.68.wav_ASR	my head was just
71-1_3326.15_3.68.wav_ASR	and i just i needed to sleep really badly
71-1_3329.87_2.42.wav_ASR	how i've learned to listen to myself
71-1_3332.61_4.86.wav_ASR	if my body says you're tired you'll pull over to the side of the road
71-1_3337.649_5.112.wav_ASR	you don't just around throw some coffee and you know the whole thing
71-1_3343.27_1.34.wav_ASR	so i pulled into this hospital
71-1_3345.85_1.66.wav_ASR	it i like it a lot
71-1_3347.849_3.041.wav_ASR	you know i didn't have a reservation at the restaurant
71-1_3351.11_9.614.wav_ASR	and i was just looking for a place that had an opening so i could go in and get out of the sun and you know cover my head
71-1_3360.85_10.96.wav_ASR	but because i was irritated as i was pushed to my boundaries my aphasia got worse
71-1_3372.95_2.18.wav_ASR	so i walked in this room
71-1_3375.69_3.36.wav_ASR	and there were lots of people around me
71-1_3379.64_2.57.wav_ASR	well actually i didn't know where to start
71-1_3382.66_1.98.wav_ASR	but i thought it said five
71-1_3385.14_0.809.wav_ASR	but i wasn't sure
71-1_3386.18_0.937.wav_ASR	when i walked into the room
71-1_3388.0_2.42.wav_ASR	and there's this woman behind the the jelly
71-1_3390.82_0.48.wav_ASR	and i said
71-1_3391.54_2.24.wav_ASR	you know i'm here for a reason
71-1_3394.62_0.32.wav_ASR	and i said
71-1_3395.02_1.08.wav_ASR	do you have any vacation
71-1_3397.62_5.68.wav_ASR	and and of course that's what happens with aphasia is you know
71-1_3403.92_3.86.wav_ASR	and those videos could have been a response to something
71-1_3408.16_3.161.wav_ASR	and people are wonderful
71-1_3411.64_1.783.wav_ASR	and they're being very careful about it
71-1_3413.72_2.58.wav_ASR	but of course i was so happy
71-1_3416.34_1.56.wav_ASR	do you have a bike
71-1_3418.62_1.778.wav_ASR	well you know what i mean
71-1_3420.7_1.02.wav_ASR	you have a vacation
71-1_3422.16_3.26.wav_ASR	and then it went into her computer
71-1_3426.26_1.62.wav_ASR	yeah everybody here's been vaccinated
71-1_3428.38_0.711.wav_ASR	you all run away
71-1_3429.38_0.988.wav_ASR	whichever thing it is
71-1_3430.72_0.54.wav_ASR	and i'm just sitting
71-1_3431.88_0.98.wav_ASR	so you have a rain
71-1_3433.14_0.664.wav_ASR	and she said
71-1_3433.92_1.033.wav_ASR	yes yes yes
71-1_3435.16_0.545.wav_ASR	don't worry
71-1_3435.705_1.0.wav_ASR	we followed college
71-1_3436.845_0.623.wav_ASR	don't worry about it
71-1_3437.565_1.797.wav_ASR	well you're not gonna get it
71-1_3439.805_1.863.wav_ASR	and she gave me something
71-1_3441.825_6.66.wav_ASR	well i realized that was one way to cover things up is you can wear a scarf
71-1_3448.76_1.911.wav_ASR	if she had a visa she had a visa
71-1_3451.44_0.31.wav_ASR	and i said
71-1_3452.165_0.98.wav_ASR	you have a bird
71-1_3453.98_1.77.wav_ASR	and so we just went with her
71-1_3456.24_2.03.wav_ASR	and then finally i went my way back
71-1_3459.14_2.56.wav_ASR	you have an empty room that i can sleep in
71-1_3462.68_5.02.wav_ASR	so i got in the room went in drank a lot of coffee and literally fell down on the floor
71-1_3468.94_0.48.wav_ASR	yeah
71-1_3471.54_2.08.wav_ASR	so that's another thing
71-1_3478.5_0.5.wav_ASR	uhhuh
71-1_3480.14_0.8.wav_ASR	what's her name
71-1_3481.62_20.94.wav_ASR	well i guess if i was going to choose something to talk about how i paid my way through my undergraduate at the university of maryland
71-1_3504.63_14.68.wav_ASR	and i worked beginning at at kind of a little coffee shop that was very busy
71-1_3520.12_1.31.wav_ASR	and i could just bite them
71-1_3522.42_1.45.wav_ASR	and they were very very good
71-1_3524.03_2.94.wav_ASR	and i did the breakfast
71-1_3528.1_14.32.wav_ASR	but i learned very quickly after about six months that you would get paid ten to fifteen per hour depending on the job
71-1_3543.14_8.24.wav_ASR	because what made sense was to find the restaurant that was the most expensive in town
71-1_3552.167_3.873.wav_ASR	they're doing the exact same part of the story
71-1_3556.39_19.218.wav_ASR	well if they're only paying five dollars for their meal and they're handing you fifty cents that's not gonna be nearly as good as if they spent twenty dollars for their meal
71-1_3575.98_5.36.wav_ASR	so what i learned to do is keep going to more and more and more and more
71-1_3582.46_20.82.wav_ASR	and i mean the the maybe unrelated stories are just as good as not better than the real story
71-1_3604.84_2.74.wav_ASR	so that's what i ended up doing
71-1_3608.2_4.664.wav_ASR	and but again it what was so interesting to me is that i worked with her
71-1_3613.32_4.157.wav_ASR	and i use the same sort of you know
71-1_3618.84_5.61.wav_ASR	you hafta sort of keep a reviewing listening to what's going on
71-1_3624.45_1.994.wav_ASR	well whether you're going to the bar or not
71-1_3626.65_1.508.wav_ASR	are you going here to get your hair done
71-1_3628.39_1.405.wav_ASR	you're gonna go people over there
71-1_3630.11_0.946.wav_ASR	you're gonna give me your chair
71-1_3631.51_5.578.wav_ASR	you hafta keep them all kind of relating to each other
71-1_3637.31_4.757.wav_ASR	trying to decide actually how you're going to prioritize each other
71-1_3642.067_10.0.wav_ASR	it's really i mean being a waitress is a really meaningful job for me
71-1_3653.687_3.66.wav_ASR	it's just boring that they don't pay people any money to do it
71-1_3657.49_4.33.wav_ASR	but i was lucky because i made enough money that i was still able to work
71-1_3662.01_8.22.wav_ASR	and i wasn't paying the degree of money that grant students and undergrad students are going to pay
71-1_3672.05_0.61.wav_ASR	what's your name
71-1_3673.93_2.38.wav_ASR	so yeah it's for my own use
71-1_3676.61_1.701.wav_ASR	graduate school that was very good
71-1_3678.311_5.3.wav_ASR	but yeah i had no student loans because i worked as a waitress for ten years
71-1_3698.06_0.59.wav_ASR	you know
71-1_3699.03_2.999.wav_ASR	and it's it's really meaningful kind of thing
71-1_3703.14_1.235.wav_ASR	well i got you know three months
71-1_3704.68_0.709.wav_ASR	and i can go get it
71-1_3705.62_0.591.wav_ASR	and i don't know where to go
71-1_3706.54_0.366.wav_ASR	and i thought
71-1_3707.62_2.536.wav_ASR	it's kind of like it's it's kind of a struggle
71-1_3710.2_0.816.wav_ASR	it's kind of fun
71-1_3713.34_0.455.wav_ASR	yeah
71-1_3718.76_0.845.wav_ASR	you can kind of say it
71-1_3719.76_0.59.wav_ASR	and they need to work
71-1_3720.7_1.28.wav_ASR	and you need more coffee in there
71-1_3722.26_0.96.wav_ASR	and you got this going
71-1_3723.52_4.32.wav_ASR	and i'll say that the second place i worked i cared for a lot of people
71-1_3728.62_8.414.wav_ASR	and when i went it to get a physical they were trying to figure out why this muscle on this arm is paralyzed
71-1_3738.16_0.74.wav_ASR	there's something going on
71-1_3739.09_0.75.wav_ASR	there's a girl girl
71-1_3739.97_0.49.wav_ASR	and i said
71-1_3740.68_1.82.wav_ASR	and i'm just really really sad
71-1_3743.1_1.92.wav_ASR	yes yes
71-1_3753.971_14.825.wav_ASR	well if i was going to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich i would begin with the bread
71-1_3769.311_2.802.wav_ASR	and taking out two slices of bread
71-1_3772.113_2.019.wav_ASR	and and laying them on the bed
71-1_3774.633_8.24.wav_ASR	when i would go and get the jar of jelly and the jar of peanut butter
71-1_3783.713_4.173.wav_ASR	and i would bring probably a spoon and a knife and a plate
71-1_3788.57_2.863.wav_ASR	and i would begin with the peanut butter and jelly
71-1_3792.068_2.272.wav_ASR	it's really difficult for me to say it
71-1_3794.488_0.84.wav_ASR	peanut butter
71-1_3796.268_4.045.wav_ASR	and i would spread that on one side of the bread
71-1_3800.828_3.96.wav_ASR	the other piece of bread i would put on
71-1_3805.108_1.06.wav_ASR	would i use a spoon
71-1_3806.568_1.011.wav_ASR	and i would pull out the jelly
71-1_3807.92_4.373.wav_ASR	and i would spread that evenly on that bread
71-1_3812.7_2.72.wav_ASR	then i would close the two of them together
71-1_3816.12_6.32.wav_ASR	and i would close the tops back on the peanut butter
71-1_3822.66_0.63.wav_ASR	put them away
71-1_3823.88_1.4.wav_ASR	and then i would eat my sandwich
71-1_3832.11_5.6.wav_ASR	well it's hard
71-1_3838.45_1.708.wav_ASR	you're not supposed to eat that stuff
71-1_3840.85_15.069.wav_ASR	when i do my laundry dispose the fact that i do have a washing machine downstairs i tend to go to the one laundry room because it's easier
71-1_3856.37_2.654.wav_ASR	and i only wanna do it once a week or every two weeks
71-1_3859.024_4.476.wav_ASR	because it's just something i find comforting about it
71-1_3863.904_3.04.wav_ASR	when i do he says
71-1_3868.044_1.74.wav_ASR	if i hafta do this i don't know
71-1_3870.184_1.23.wav_ASR	so let me think about it
71-1_3871.644_3.54.wav_ASR	all of my daughters
71-1_3875.33_5.584.wav_ASR	and i usually use these pills to find out whether they go into my brain or not
71-1_3880.914_18.7.wav_ASR	and when i decide that everything needs to be washed which also will include the towels the other towels handcloths handcloths handcloths
71-1_3900.01_5.52.wav_ASR	and i would use a container of peanut butter
71-1_3907.24_0.66.wav_ASR	and i would put it
71-1_3908.31_4.39.wav_ASR	we'd carry it to the back side of my the back porch
71-1_3913.6_8.52.wav_ASR	and i would make sure i had coworkers or had cash that i could use for the grocery store
71-1_3923.11_1.57.wav_ASR	and i would go into the laundry room
71-1_3924.88_6.327.wav_ASR	the largest medicine that was available that i could do all of my laundry at one time
71-1_3931.207_5.18.wav_ASR	and i would put the peanut butter
71-1_3937.23_12.357.wav_ASR	if they didn't all fit i would make sure that the clothing that could be washed at a higher temperature would go in the washer
71-1_3950.36_1.814.wav_ASR	make sure the soap was in there
71-1_3952.46_2.068.wav_ASR	make sure i had enough coffee
71-1_3955.36_6.792.wav_ASR	and then i would probably go by food or something there are people
71-1_3962.36_0.924.wav_ASR	come back
71-1_3963.54_1.44.wav_ASR	them in the dryer
71-1_3965.86_2.403.wav_ASR	well i don't really follow them the way i used to
71-1_3968.54_0.71.wav_ASR	oh i just can't think
71-1_3969.66_4.29.wav_ASR	and then put them away kind of as i use them a lot
71-1_3985.92_4.75.wav_ASR	you mean what would i do without it
71-1_3995.3_0.57.wav_ASR	oh i said
71-1_3996.39_11.38.wav_ASR	well the first thing i would do every morning is start my coffee because that really is gonna help me to have a good day
71-1_4008.33_2.38.wav_ASR	oh i don't understand
71-1_4011.9_2.75.wav_ASR	and i usually do the far over here
71-1_4015.51_1.41.wav_ASR	and i really didn't know
71-1_4017.61_2.19.wav_ASR	so i usually would climb a ladder
71-1_4020.33_1.78.wav_ASR	started the the water
71-1_4023.83_2.36.wav_ASR	and i would go into a coma
71-1_4026.63_3.12.wav_ASR	generally i have some idea of what's going on
71-1_4030.63_3.28.wav_ASR	if only because i hafta dig stuff up in the hole
71-1_4033.91_1.26.wav_ASR	and i don't have it
71-1_4035.602_4.45.wav_ASR	well i don't really have time to look a lot of things
71-1_4040.49_2.54.wav_ASR	so i'm gonna have a nice idea of what i'm gonna wear to the party
71-1_4043.51_5.14.wav_ASR	so i usually start well before i go to school
71-1_4049.59_3.481.wav_ASR	and then whatever pants or shirt i wear
71-1_4053.071_3.66.wav_ASR	and at that point it the water is usually frozen
71-1_4057.231_2.079.wav_ASR	so yeah i got my license
71-1_4059.631_10.319.wav_ASR	well i'm you know running around here half dressed and then figuring out what kind of shirt i'm gonna wear whether it's a t-shirt or a long sleeve shirt
71-1_4070.191_1.359.wav_ASR	so i needta wear an eye patch
71-1_4071.75_1.32.wav_ASR	do i need to wear a light jacket
71-1_4073.07_2.819.wav_ASR	and while the police are coming
71-1_4076.37_2.828.wav_ASR	but the time the cops are dead i've got all my basics covered
71-1_4079.87_6.666.wav_ASR	and then i take the coffee with me in the morning when i make decisions about eating and healthy eating
71-1_4086.94_4.822.wav_ASR	but yeah the basis is all affected the night before so i hafta go to work
71-1_4091.79_5.715.wav_ASR	and if i actually am tired and don't know what i'm doing i just wear black because it's easier
71-1_4098.11_1.432.wav_ASR	so i have a lot of black ink
71-1_4100.07_0.77.wav_ASR	oh there's the slipper
71-2_14.77_15.16.wav_ASR	well i think my favorite part about where i live and i live on the near side of magnolia is that it's very good
71-2_30.89_1.34.wav_ASR	medical is a sister
71-2_32.41_2.38.wav_ASR	we we have four different lakes that are
71-2_35.21_8.54.wav_ASR	and the medicare actually comes from a work for health that actually covers me
71-2_44.69_5.4.wav_ASR	so a block away from where i live it is very good
71-2_50.725_3.302.wav_ASR	and it's the biggest of all
71-2_54.665_6.7.wav_ASR	and what i like the most about it is there's a bike path in the city
71-2_62.83_6.42.wav_ASR	the leg is to my left with a burning pain in the leg
71-2_70.27_7.38.wav_ASR	and i literally can get pretty much every day that i need to go in the city of miami with my husband
71-2_79.43_1.82.wav_ASR	and i'm very close to the limit
71-2_82.17_4.02.wav_ASR	so one of the things i do when i'm tired
71-2_86.95_2.98.wav_ASR	those old i would pretty much call it fast and furious
71-2_90.071_3.86.wav_ASR	and i'm not not good
71-2_94.531_6.34.wav_ASR	in my mind i was running about seven or eight years ago
71-2_100.931_2.26.wav_ASR	well i would go down to about seventy five percent
71-2_103.351_3.4.wav_ASR	and i'm pretty much just walking and talking
71-2_107.621_3.7.wav_ASR	and we're more like eleven midnights a day
71-2_111.741_2.56.wav_ASR	well i usually get about five in every morning
71-2_114.621_7.309.wav_ASR	it's it's it's kind of mediated in the sense that you know
71-2_122.181_1.029.wav_ASR	you can see the bird
71-2_123.87_10.3.wav_ASR	it's just much more satisfactory than it used to be
71-2_134.77_3.32.wav_ASR	so that's the one of the things i really like about it
71-2_139.91_1.36.wav_ASR	and bread
71-2_142.244_0.5.wav_ASR	oh my god
71-2_144.217_0.467.wav_ASR	uhhuh
71-2_144.93_1.073.wav_ASR	well i don't think that's
71-2_146.764_2.154.wav_ASR	well not sure that's the right word that i'm looking for
71-2_149.284_0.5.wav_ASR	and i mean
71-2_153.748_0.593.wav_ASR	oh what is it
71-2_155.384_1.306.wav_ASR	well i just see the whole thing
71-2_156.884_0.526.wav_ASR	but i kept saying
71-2_157.764_1.566.wav_ASR	well i'm squirting that word at myself
71-2_159.584_0.92.wav_ASR	now i wasn't
71-2_160.706_2.562.wav_ASR	sometimes i hear a word that i already know
71-2_163.426_0.544.wav_ASR	and i kept saying
71-2_164.206_1.044.wav_ASR	that i'm saying that wrong
71-2_165.746_4.624.wav_ASR	but i i just hafta be aware with words that i don't know what they mean
71-2_171.106_0.564.wav_ASR	oh yes
71-2_173.086_3.54.wav_ASR	well long the lake is much better than being alone
71-2_177.146_2.769.wav_ASR	and i the block away which is why i like it
71-2_179.915_0.5.wav_ASR	yeah
71-2_200.31_2.58.wav_ASR	again my speech is not right
71-2_204.23_8.987.wav_ASR	but the most part when i speak i know what i'm saying
71-2_213.77_16.481.wav_ASR	but if i try to say something that's more concrete something in more detail or becomes more explicit my words don't make sense at all
71-2_230.251_8.589.wav_ASR	or the words are in my brain but i'm not quite able to articulate them
71-2_238.97_3.38.wav_ASR	generally i know right away when i hear something
71-2_243.091_1.339.wav_ASR	but sometimes i don't
71-2_244.631_2.0.wav_ASR	yes during the day i i said to myself
71-2_246.696_3.48.wav_ASR	and well we've got this lecture coming up in january
71-2_250.676_1.27.wav_ASR	and she said
71-2_253.536_0.404.wav_ASR	why far far away
71-2_253.94_0.621.wav_ASR	it's april
71-2_254.576_0.84.wav_ASR	and i said
71-2_255.492_0.747.wav_ASR	what did i say
71-2_256.376_0.528.wav_ASR	and she says
71-2_256.996_0.815.wav_ASR	you said firstnamej and i said
71-2_258.98_1.021.wav_ASR	well it feels like janney
71-2_260.696_3.525.wav_ASR	again i try to just swim those and figure out where to go with them
71-2_264.41_8.22.wav_ASR	but i simply can't trust that what will come out of my mouth is going to be correct
71-2_273.01_14.82.wav_ASR	and i don't know how to do how to fix that except to keep trying to restore those language passports that have been devastated by the stroke
71-2_295.73_2.62.wav_ASR	yes i remember exactly when i had the stroke
71-2_298.52_5.42.wav_ASR	well i had a stroke on january first twenty sixteen
71-2_320.33_14.302.wav_ASR	so i essentially had a thunderclap headache to my right temple and didn't know what was going on
71-2_335.13_1.573.wav_ASR	and then of course they admitted me
71-2_336.703_9.4.wav_ASR	but it was past the window of opportunity to be able to give me some type of drugs that might help me with my stroke
71-2_347.563_2.227.wav_ASR	so i ended the hospital
71-2_350.403_1.92.wav_ASR	my assumption i would have another stroke
71-2_353.183_0.607.wav_ASR	how i have not
71-2_354.09_4.36.wav_ASR	and they have not been able to find the cats of the animals
71-2_359.72_1.67.wav_ASR	and i assume it was the perfect scenario
71-2_362.04_12.44.wav_ASR	imagine it might have been a conversation of working out really hard being stressed and all that kind of stuff
71-2_374.76_2.765.wav_ASR	those were premedical students
71-2_378.52_3.0.wav_ASR	we were in a position then where it was pretty good
71-2_381.743_3.632.wav_ASR	and and i don't know what else to say
71-2_385.583_5.67.wav_ASR	literally there's there's physically nothing wrong with me
71-2_391.703_3.994.wav_ASR	and all of my numbers indicate that i should not be working
71-2_395.843_2.223.wav_ASR	and yes i had a stroke
71-2_398.363_1.62.wav_ASR	so yeah it's
71-2_400.181_2.92.wav_ASR	peanut butter and jelly
71-2_403.981_4.263.wav_ASR	which at some point i you just move on from it
71-2_408.721_0.379.wav_ASR	yeah
71-2_418.32_17.68.wav_ASR	well as i said a week ago most of the recovery has been suicidal and has not been done to the degree of therapy that it should have been
71-2_437.57_8.66.wav_ASR	and i think that's kind of a travelie in the sense that i like to explore
71-2_446.73_3.68.wav_ASR	and i was certified as having a mild seizure disorder
71-2_451.57_12.92.wav_ASR	we are in the position of the personnel to come to completely recover if we're given the right instructions and the right medication
71-2_464.99_16.04.wav_ASR	so i think the first six months after stroke is really quick in terms of recovery because you're bleeding is able to heal a little bit more
71-2_482.13_11.14.wav_ASR	well i'm really disappointed in the american healthcare insurance in the sense that i was not able to get anything
71-2_493.53_18.08.wav_ASR	and so what i've done on my own is really increase my the vitality of my disease which was already meted out to me
71-2_511.89_1.417.wav_ASR	how do i already understood it
71-2_513.307_1.654.wav_ASR	and i've been doing that for about ten years
71-2_515.327_10.103.wav_ASR	and i gave up drinking completely though i was drunk as much as i was tired
71-2_525.43_10.02.wav_ASR	but it might increase fluency in reading
71-2_536.21_4.1.wav_ASR	it might increase inflammation in the brain
71-2_540.325_10.3.wav_ASR	and that's something that i'm trying to work very strongly to make sure that i have an attitude improvement and all that
71-2_551.465_1.7.wav_ASR	and i've increased my exercise
71-2_553.585_1.6.wav_ASR	again i've already
71-2_559.81_19.778.wav_ASR	so i've increased the cognitive cognitive test that i do every single day to make sure that i can make sure that my focus is clear and accurate
71-2_579.588_2.895.wav_ASR	again i was in the hospital
71-2_582.748_15.385.wav_ASR	so i have always done a lot of reading every day doing a lot of writing every day trying to develop and work on my writing
71-2_598.133_2.617.wav_ASR	how i've done it much more consistently than in the beginning
71-2_601.85_7.16.wav_ASR	writing is always relative in the sense that i have the opportunity to write
71-2_609.473_2.297.wav_ASR	and i do sometimes use the word
71-2_612.753_2.617.wav_ASR	you're really catching it when i edit it
71-2_615.79_3.34.wav_ASR	and i always hadta eat it before the stroke
71-2_619.37_9.39.wav_ASR	so i don't know to what extent those medicines are connected to the stroke aphasia or whatever it is
71-2_628.91_4.36.wav_ASR	sometimes you do a a rough draft to get the ideas down
71-2_633.443_2.915.wav_ASR	and then you find it the second time around
71-2_637.303_9.727.wav_ASR	so i i think the only real difference from the stroke that after this stroke it's been very difficult for me
71-2_647.963_4.187.wav_ASR	before the stroke i traveled a lot
71-2_652.45_7.12.wav_ASR	but if i didn't i just poured on because i have a schedule to keep
71-2_660.87_8.901.wav_ASR	now it's a priority for me to make sure that i have adequate to me to make sure that i can do my job
71-2_670.05_5.06.wav_ASR	but nothing that i just have a reservation every single day that i remember
71-2_676.49_0.563.wav_ASR	really wet
71-2_677.41_1.165.wav_ASR	each session every day
71-2_679.05_2.72.wav_ASR	push my brain as much as i can
71-2_682.23_7.28.wav_ASR	maybe i made attempt to take back up a ladder
71-2_689.79_3.4.wav_ASR	and i was taking spanish classes before the stroke
71-2_693.397_2.653.wav_ASR	when i was in the hospital
71-2_696.33_3.6.wav_ASR	and i picked up a little bit of dance when i lived in new york
71-2_701.01_4.263.wav_ASR	but i thought spanish would be much more useful than german
71-2_706.37_2.1.wav_ASR	so i started taking a spanish class
71-2_708.69_4.73.wav_ASR	and i hadta discontinue it because of the stroke
71-2_713.57_1.99.wav_ASR	it just wasn't working out that way
71-2_716.7_10.19.wav_ASR	but from what i read recently i think one of the things that might be really helpful to realize my english is not very good
71-2_727.56_1.88.wav_ASR	it's i you know what i mean
71-2_729.6_1.14.wav_ASR	how i thought it might be confusing
71-2_731.12_2.971.wav_ASR	but why not try it on
71-2_734.091_1.949.wav_ASR	why not say what happened to me
71-2_736.54_3.066.wav_ASR	so yeah that may be what i do next but
71-2_739.76_1.333.wav_ASR	what i'm already doing
71-2_767.08_3.158.wav_ASR	what's her name
71-2_771.54_4.68.wav_ASR	happy happy
71-2_779.25_0.7.wav_ASR	uhhuh
71-2_782.83_5.9.wav_ASR	well i'm gonna talk about my reaction to what happened nine eleven in two thousand and seven
71-2_790.19_2.46.wav_ASR	and i was
71-2_793.11_3.98.wav_ASR	it was the beginning of the spring semester in two thousand and four
71-2_797.09_4.16.wav_ASR	and and my daughter hadta help me
71-2_803.03_9.82.wav_ASR	so as soon as she left at about eighty five i turned on the computer because i was working
71-2_813.15_3.66.wav_ASR	yes i i should have already finished my stroke
71-2_817.67_1.9.wav_ASR	and it was generally good
71-2_819.73_2.089.wav_ASR	but i was kinda playing with some of the kids
71-2_822.23_5.923.wav_ASR	my education psychology class because i just wanted to just learn more
71-2_828.41_1.08.wav_ASR	so i wasn't alone
71-2_830.33_2.92.wav_ASR	obviously the radio wasn't on because i hadta go to work
71-2_833.352_4.423.wav_ASR	and i certainly wasn't watching television when i was driving
71-2_837.872_12.614.wav_ASR	so i was in this zone of sinai with no connection to the outside world what so going through these different organizations and deciding which one fit for me
71-2_851.51_5.54.wav_ASR	and at twelve o'clock in the afternoon i was going to leave
71-2_857.21_3.32.wav_ASR	and i was gonna go to my job and work
71-2_861.07_1.14.wav_ASR	and it was a beautiful day
71-2_862.61_1.64.wav_ASR	was you know stepmother there
71-2_868.85_0.8.wav_ASR	and i turned on the radio
71-2_870.87_3.98.wav_ASR	and the announcer said
71-2_875.69_2.16.wav_ASR	don't really know if the schools are gonna work
71-2_878.53_0.64.wav_ASR	and i kept saying
71-2_879.77_1.12.wav_ASR	the school is gonna open
71-2_881.09_0.48.wav_ASR	what's up
71-2_888.143_3.145.wav_ASR	and and i got to the the doctor
71-2_892.33_2.473.wav_ASR	and there were televisions on the wall
71-2_895.423_2.206.wav_ASR	they were in the desk when you come in
71-2_897.723_1.36.wav_ASR	and that never happened
71-2_899.443_1.827.wav_ASR	everybody looked really ugly
71-2_901.963_1.96.wav_ASR	so i i'm walking in there now
71-2_904.483_2.874.wav_ASR	think happy here that i don't know what's going on
71-2_907.37_1.5.wav_ASR	but everybody else knows me
71-2_909.35_2.12.wav_ASR	they're all staring at the screen
71-2_911.55_3.34.wav_ASR	so i went to the second one where my truck is
71-2_915.83_3.818.wav_ASR	and again the toddlers were not wearing their rain gear
71-2_919.77_3.262.wav_ASR	but that's what i was gonna do that day because i hadta do that
71-2_923.27_1.915.wav_ASR	and that's when i said
71-2_925.185_12.8.wav_ASR	at that point by two o'clock in the afternoon they were just replaying it over and over and over again about the two planes that were hit
71-2_938.265_2.813.wav_ASR	and they were introducing people who were trying to help me
71-2_941.365_1.64.wav_ASR	and everything is covered with ashes
71-2_944.49_6.22.wav_ASR	and i remember getting on the the treadmill and you know putting on my headphones
71-2_951.07_7.56.wav_ASR	and i just kept going faster and faster and faster because the adrenaline of what had happened to me was gone
71-2_959.41_3.86.wav_ASR	so i kinda use that you know to improve myself
71-2_963.53_2.82.wav_ASR	and i got upset
71-2_966.61_1.02.wav_ASR	and i went home and said
71-2_967.91_0.384.wav_ASR	me and i
71-2_968.294_4.966.wav_ASR	well i got a really close friend that lives in denver
71-2_973.35_2.086.wav_ASR	and so is it
71-2_975.69_0.829.wav_ASR	what's going on
71-2_977.21_0.94.wav_ASR	so i tried to call
71-2_978.45_3.78.wav_ASR	well of course i couldn't get through because all the children were there
71-2_982.23_3.06.wav_ASR	now one could get home and eat
71-2_985.57_1.836.wav_ASR	everything was shot down
71-2_988.71_2.16.wav_ASR	and i got on my bike
71-2_991.09_0.94.wav_ASR	and i started email
71-2_992.31_1.48.wav_ASR	and then i emailed my department
71-2_993.97_1.78.wav_ASR	and i was in the political science department
71-2_995.93_0.34.wav_ASR	and i said
71-2_996.81_2.067.wav_ASR	we're gonna have a panel on monday
71-2_999.41_1.76.wav_ASR	we're gonna invite the kingdom
71-2_1001.32_2.481.wav_ASR	and we're going to explain what is happening
71-2_1004.36_5.934.wav_ASR	and we're gonna have a good time
71-2_1010.3_3.871.wav_ASR	we're gonna explain the the rehabilitation process
71-2_1014.18_3.5.wav_ASR	we're gonna talk about the history of it
71-2_1018.48_2.588.wav_ASR	we're gonna explain exactly what is going on
71-2_1021.068_3.442.wav_ASR	and everybody got back to school
71-2_1024.788_2.32.wav_ASR	and i mean they everybody returned to school
71-2_1027.288_1.502.wav_ASR	and i'd be happy to talk about it
71-2_1029.048_5.302.wav_ASR	and i'd be happy to talk about the songs in a row that i remember
71-2_1034.35_7.22.wav_ASR	and maybe that's related to what's going on with the the the
71-2_1041.762_18.784.wav_ASR	all we knew at that point that they were coming from the military and that they were alternating the individual states and the western states
71-2_1060.546_2.0.wav_ASR	and and how it is that we're gonna be
71-2_1063.386_1.58.wav_ASR	they were employees with me
71-2_1066.026_2.694.wav_ASR	oh yeah it all came together
71-2_1069.006_1.514.wav_ASR	and i went to bed at one o'clock in the morning
71-2_1071.126_4.007.wav_ASR	finally got an email back from my friend in denver and said
71-2_1075.986_3.141.wav_ASR	and i got up to campus the next day
71-2_1079.127_3.12.wav_ASR	and all the letters were delivered
71-2_1082.467_8.34.wav_ASR	and all we did is talk about what happened in every single class after hour after hour after hour
71-2_1091.927_2.073.wav_ASR	that's that's a little bit
71-2_1094.327_0.6.wav_ASR	you yes
71-2_1095.507_3.195.wav_ASR	it was a great palladium
71-2_1098.702_2.177.wav_ASR	and i think we had five hundred people
71-2_1101.002_4.48.wav_ASR	it's standing long standing cinderella
71-2_1106.562_0.607.wav_ASR	my turn to say
71-2_1107.262_1.0.wav_ASR	stand down
71-2_1108.642_3.021.wav_ASR	people hadta stay at home
71-2_1111.942_1.56.wav_ASR	what i'm trying to say is sleeping
71-2_1115.89_2.82.wav_ASR	well i've all these fears that i useta be afraid of
71-2_1118.87_0.92.wav_ASR	well i start to say it
71-2_1119.99_1.393.wav_ASR	well i forgot what the order is
71-2_1122.11_1.8.wav_ASR	standing room
71-2_1124.33_0.389.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
71-2_1124.719_2.671.wav_ASR	it fell up the place basically one after the other
71-2_1127.69_1.1.wav_ASR	and everybody's crazy
71-2_1129.59_0.76.wav_ASR	how do they hate us
71-2_1130.57_2.4.wav_ASR	and that's what we began to do
71-2_1133.59_0.94.wav_ASR	uhhuh
71-2_1136.424_12.445.wav_ASR	other than i missed the whole thing because of course i was online writing a lecture that i never gave because it was too much work
71-2_1189.34_19.84.wav_ASR	well this seems to be taking place a newspaper article an newspaper which is really interesting because it's about the story
71-2_1209.06_5.336.wav_ASR	and it looks like what's going on is a boy is kicking the ball
71-2_1214.88_2.2.wav_ASR	and he's playing with his soccer ball
71-2_1217.52_1.92.wav_ASR	he's practicing his stroke
71-2_1220.38_11.126.wav_ASR	and unfortunately this time the ball doesn't go where he hoped it would go in the window
71-2_1232.06_5.1.wav_ASR	and it looks like it might have been the window of his house
71-2_1237.38_1.26.wav_ASR	it could have been his father
71-2_1238.86_0.86.wav_ASR	it's difficult to tell
71-2_1239.78_7.2.wav_ASR	but it was a window that was next to the yard in which he was playing soccer
71-2_1247.88_3.96.wav_ASR	well it hit the the glass of the window and broke it
71-2_1252.48_4.08.wav_ASR	and unfortunately there was a man that was sitting in the chair right next to me
71-2_1257.78_7.66.wav_ASR	and the soccer ball not only broke the window but went through completely into the man's house
71-2_1266.32_2.88.wav_ASR	well apparently they have no screens from what i can see
71-2_1269.48_2.687.wav_ASR	so it can't be disney because we have firstnamem
71-2_1272.167_11.407.wav_ASR	and anyway the ball ended up in the house in the window
71-2_1284.62_3.27.wav_ASR	and he was not please at all
71-2_1288.15_5.76.wav_ASR	he stood up and looked out the window to try to figure out what happened
71-2_1294.2_1.43.wav_ASR	where did the ball come from
71-2_1295.93_9.0.wav_ASR	and who is the person who had delivered that good news to cinderella
71-2_1305.71_7.06.wav_ASR	he's it's clear that there's going to be some kind of rehabilitation for him
71-2_1313.51_3.88.wav_ASR	because if it's his son his mom is going to be happy
71-2_1317.638_12.22.wav_ASR	and if it's his neighbor he's gonna expect an application and probably some sort of payment to retrieve the cat
71-2_1331.61_2.368.wav_ASR	so firstnamer and the son
71-2_1351.36_23.18.wav_ASR	well we're gonna tell one of these stories mother knows best which is a play on the fact that there appeared father and cinderella
71-2_1374.637_1.24.wav_ASR	and it was very painful
71-2_1376.717_2.203.wav_ASR	you know the father said
71-2_1379.217_1.12.wav_ASR	my mother is the housekeeper
71-2_1380.877_2.16.wav_ASR	the father knows what's going on
71-2_1383.339_19.92.wav_ASR	in any case this particular story is gonna be mother knows best which is really very interesting in the sense that mother's generally i would say as a general rule you know
71-2_1403.327_4.073.wav_ASR	well not always but in this particular case that's exactly what it is
71-2_1407.4_17.237.wav_ASR	and and what's going on is this child and the child's mother is deciding over whether this boy needs to take an umbrella or not
71-2_1424.637_5.175.wav_ASR	and the mother is saying because she they're getting ready for the ball to go
71-2_1430.477_1.44.wav_ASR	and the mother is saying
71-2_1432.357_10.134.wav_ASR	it's up on what we see on the clouds that are outside of the sky and what we see on the weather forecast
71-2_1442.577_1.295.wav_ASR	so i think you should take an umbrella
71-2_1443.872_2.02.wav_ASR	and the little boy is going to school
71-2_1446.272_1.58.wav_ASR	he's not taking an umbrella
71-2_1448.132_1.546.wav_ASR	and i don't need it
71-2_1450.032_1.204.wav_ASR	and i don't care if it rains
71-2_1451.572_0.969.wav_ASR	and i'm not gonna meet them
71-2_1453.572_2.904.wav_ASR	my i'm fine on my own
71-2_1457.132_0.708.wav_ASR	so she said
71-2_1458.152_1.904.wav_ASR	well alright you know big one
71-2_1460.812_1.116.wav_ASR	and she says goodbye to him
71-2_1462.212_0.403.wav_ASR	and he really you know
71-2_1462.615_2.1.wav_ASR	if she's still holding the umbrella
71-2_1465.335_0.768.wav_ASR	he handed it over
71-2_1466.655_2.06.wav_ASR	and it's not just a spritz
71-2_1468.935_3.82.wav_ASR	but it really starts to rain really hard
71-2_1472.915_1.22.wav_ASR	so it's a downpour
71-2_1475.7_2.625.wav_ASR	and he doesn't know
71-2_1478.655_2.945.wav_ASR	so the rain is getting heavier
71-2_1481.94_2.26.wav_ASR	and he's getting really really wet
71-2_1484.32_4.93.wav_ASR	his clothes are getting drenched and sizzling sizzling all over the place
71-2_1489.82_1.78.wav_ASR	so he gets about hammocks
71-2_1492.22_1.78.wav_ASR	and he can't even see what's going on
71-2_1494.3_3.58.wav_ASR	so he heads back to his mother's house
71-2_1499.24_0.76.wav_ASR	he looks at it up
71-2_1501.22_2.46.wav_ASR	and she has the grace not the
71-2_1503.88_0.744.wav_ASR	what told you so
71-2_1505.06_1.279.wav_ASR	because mother's know better
71-2_1506.48_1.32.wav_ASR	they knew it never worked for her
71-2_1508.74_1.78.wav_ASR	and he stands her up and looks at her
71-2_1510.86_1.98.wav_ASR	and she hands him the umbrella
71-2_1513.76_0.96.wav_ASR	and he hits off the window
71-2_1515.14_3.02.wav_ASR	and this time remembering in his head
71-2_1519.26_3.04.wav_ASR	my mother's not always wrong about it
71-2_1524.14_4.02.wav_ASR	and of course he forgets it by the next week when somebody comes along
71-2_1528.48_7.687.wav_ASR	where we are in this week he is now assured that his mother actually has two daughters
71-2_1536.5_2.081.wav_ASR	my motherinlaw
71-2_1555.22_3.121.wav_ASR	well speaking of donna at the hospital
71-2_1559.54_8.9.wav_ASR	what happened here begins because the cat is in the tree
71-2_1569.36_3.67.wav_ASR	and the cat has the right to sit on the tree
71-2_1573.78_3.17.wav_ASR	but the next door neighbor has a dog
71-2_1576.95_6.958.wav_ASR	and the dog came out and immediately saw the cat and ran over and started barking at him
71-2_1584.11_1.22.wav_ASR	and the cat was screeching
71-2_1586.07_5.36.wav_ASR	well the cat ran from the the dog and ran up the tree because he was barking
71-2_1591.15_6.0.wav_ASR	and that was a way to get away from the dog because it was barking
71-2_1597.65_2.042.wav_ASR	so the cat climbed up the tree
71-2_1600.41_0.894.wav_ASR	do you see young kid
71-2_1601.49_6.55.wav_ASR	so a cat that's just barely a kitten and isn't really associated with the dog
71-2_1608.43_1.61.wav_ASR	so the cat crawled up
71-2_1610.78_6.66.wav_ASR	the little girl ran out saw her cat was up in the tree and called for somebody to come down
71-2_1619.16_1.18.wav_ASR	my cat is up in the tree
71-2_1621.04_3.96.wav_ASR	and she's out on the ball
71-2_1625.76_9.82.wav_ASR	and it doesn't look like she's finding her way to get back out because she's very lonely and alone
71-2_1636.4_1.22.wav_ASR	so please help me
71-2_1638.16_2.86.wav_ASR	please help me get my cat out of the tree
71-2_1641.3_3.6.wav_ASR	well the father's trying to be shiver and the dog is barking
71-2_1645.16_4.36.wav_ASR	so he immediately goes into the garage and finds the slipper
71-2_1650.2_21.487.wav_ASR	and the plan for him was he would simply be able to climb up the ladder get to the tree where the cat was grabbed it in side his way
71-2_1671.68_2.39.wav_ASR	and then he could be you know the man
71-2_1674.76_5.62.wav_ASR	he could feel his mother's presence
71-2_1681.42_2.26.wav_ASR	well unfortunately he got up in the tree
71-2_1684.54_10.49.wav_ASR	and the he hadn't secured the ladder against the tree
71-2_1695.33_1.1.wav_ASR	and it stopped
71-2_1697.33_4.1.wav_ASR	so now we have two people that hafta be rescued me
71-2_1701.65_7.1.wav_ASR	we have the cat that is still meowing loudly and barking
71-2_1709.29_12.14.wav_ASR	and of course the father can't reach it because his wave is too heavy to be able to move into those limbs or whatever
71-2_1721.65_1.78.wav_ASR	and then he would fall down and get up
71-2_1724.19_6.76.wav_ASR	so at this point the mother who knows best has called the firemen and said
71-2_1731.81_2.587.wav_ASR	we've got a sister flying around
71-2_1734.59_1.211.wav_ASR	well that is what she says
71-2_1735.801_6.58.wav_ASR	but that's what she thought in her brain because she doesn't want me to say those words
71-2_1742.881_2.24.wav_ASR	can you please help me
71-2_1745.553_16.023.wav_ASR	unfortunately we now need help from firefighters to not only get the cat out of the tree but my husband who didn't know what was going on
71-2_1761.576_6.523.wav_ASR	and my daughter is still happy because she's worried about the cat
71-2_1768.376_1.494.wav_ASR	and now she's worried about her gown
71-2_1770.876_2.274.wav_ASR	and the dog is still barking
71-2_1773.756_3.1.wav_ASR	what's what she should be doing is she's an adult
71-2_1777.576_1.228.wav_ASR	because the firefighters are there
71-2_1779.076_1.061.wav_ASR	and they're coming over
71-2_1780.05_2.35.wav_ASR	and they're going to help the man get down from the tree
71-2_1782.71_3.09.wav_ASR	and then they're going to reach out and try it on
71-2_1786.3_8.752.wav_ASR	and what the mother's gonna do is she's gonna go and grab the dog and put him in the other room so that everybody can be safe
71-2_1796.11_3.213.wav_ASR	and everybody can make it out of the tree without getting down
71-2_1799.323_1.586.wav_ASR	and he said
71-2_2004.09_16.38.wav_ASR	and what we're essentially looking for here is education mobility and social mobility and what the criteria is that a woman has to be able to participate in the program
71-2_2021.77_1.86.wav_ASR	so we're gonna start with that
71-2_2023.99_13.24.wav_ASR	and this is an example of the very recent rolls that were available to women in hawaii
71-2_2038.46_5.74.wav_ASR	now what we're seeing here is a family which is really interesting to me
71-2_2045.26_10.16.wav_ASR	and the in both cases what we had were two sisters
71-2_2056.56_3.02.wav_ASR	and each of them had a spouse
71-2_2061.01_13.758.wav_ASR	the husband had one daughter whose name was cinderella
71-2_2075.16_1.256.wav_ASR	but his wife had died
71-2_2076.416_3.656.wav_ASR	so he had a young daughter who was about eighteen
71-2_2080.296_11.24.wav_ASR	and again in a european style we'll say ninety seventies or something like that
71-2_2091.936_1.731.wav_ASR	and i hadta have a umbrella
71-2_2093.856_0.741.wav_ASR	that was her wardrobe
71-2_2094.68_3.78.wav_ASR	well people were really rigid in terms of what they could do
71-2_2099.12_3.78.wav_ASR	so he hadta find a wife and order to care for his daughter
71-2_2103.96_13.22.wav_ASR	in another part of town relatively sane social status we have a man and woman in the same house
71-2_2118.02_0.76.wav_ASR	and he said
71-2_2119.64_8.66.wav_ASR	so the only way that she would be able to survive as a female is to find a wife
71-2_2129.4_2.86.wav_ASR	so they're both out looking for another one
71-2_2133.36_1.3.wav_ASR	and they meet each other
71-2_2135.0_28.16.wav_ASR	and of course what the husband is looking for the wife is a mother and you know we'll do all the other things that women supposed to do because we have very different personalities with each other
71-2_2164.74_1.14.wav_ASR	so they meet each other
71-2_2166.5_3.74.wav_ASR	and he's gotten the impression that she's gonna be married
71-2_2170.64_3.8.wav_ASR	and she certainly gusses all over the place
71-2_2175.66_1.62.wav_ASR	and so they they married
71-2_2177.28_12.12.wav_ASR	there are now three children two daughters from her immediate family and cinderella
71-2_2189.86_2.76.wav_ASR	and they've found it to this news article
71-2_2193.69_11.26.wav_ASR	the father then follows his rule which is go out and make money for the family and leave money for the future
71-2_2205.31_21.673.wav_ASR	the stepmother on the other hand has not forgotten that she's going to marry her brother's brother inlaw's daughter
71-2_2227.87_6.94.wav_ASR	and for whatever reason the father doesn't appear in what he should be doing
71-2_2235.41_10.02.wav_ASR	and so what we have is this really terrible situation with the stroke
71-2_2245.527_4.893.wav_ASR	and cinderella got a beautiful new dress
71-2_2250.667_1.201.wav_ASR	and she was close to her father
71-2_2252.027_0.76.wav_ASR	you lost your right hand
71-2_2253.147_9.1.wav_ASR	now she's also in this situation where she's clearly treated differently than her stepdaughters
71-2_2262.887_2.555.wav_ASR	mental retardation
71-2_2265.442_1.074.wav_ASR	my husband all the time
71-2_2267.022_0.954.wav_ASR	and anyway moving on
71-2_2269.122_1.278.wav_ASR	and they live in sinai
71-2_2270.462_8.32.wav_ASR	there's no way that women can improve their their situation in the society at all
71-2_2279.762_2.46.wav_ASR	is the only possible option for me
71-2_2282.222_18.073.wav_ASR	and so they're private schools are going up is to learn how to manage a house and also attract to the higher higher education students
71-2_2300.295_2.36.wav_ASR	and i don't know what happens if they're not happy
71-2_2303.295_2.211.wav_ASR	and i i guess they just said
71-2_2305.815_2.972.wav_ASR	in any case that's not part of this particular story
71-2_2309.455_1.22.wav_ASR	oh she's dressed up
71-2_2310.915_3.032.wav_ASR	and so that's one conversation she doesn't have to go away
71-2_2313.947_8.6.wav_ASR	in any case on the other side of the city at a higher place
71-2_2323.465_20.82.wav_ASR	and finally while the prince has essentially a lot of anxiety and he's at the top of his career and social status stephanie is going to marry him
71-2_2344.363_9.7.wav_ASR	because the plane is that he will marry a wife and that wonderful woman
71-2_2354.443_6.44.wav_ASR	and those children then means that there will be eleven that will continue to go to school
71-2_2361.383_1.861.wav_ASR	so he may not wanna get it
71-2_2363.24_6.92.wav_ASR	and we don't really know what his jewelry identity is or anything
71-2_2370.56_2.72.wav_ASR	but he's he understands what his dog is barking
71-2_2373.42_1.38.wav_ASR	he hasta find a ladder
71-2_2375.14_1.42.wav_ASR	he hasta find a pair
71-2_2377.46_11.7.wav_ASR	and his plan is to find someone who's relatively attractive while he follows the opposite side of the country
71-2_2389.76_4.76.wav_ASR	so the plan is he's gonna get this up there
71-2_2394.609_4.6.wav_ASR	yes they're gonna have this shoe dance the prince
71-2_2400.449_1.88.wav_ASR	and everyone in the class
71-2_2403.749_2.623.wav_ASR	well i'm assuming we're pretty much middle class now
71-2_2406.669_3.7.wav_ASR	he's not really going to the palace or anything
71-2_2410.569_1.731.wav_ASR	it's not part of this story
71-2_2413.36_14.64.wav_ASR	is inviting all of the eligible females who are not married to come an interview for him so that he can find a wife
71-2_2429.0_1.96.wav_ASR	and i guess this is clearly
71-2_2432.56_5.54.wav_ASR	it's almost like that baltimore show which i've never seen in my life
71-2_2438.84_2.588.wav_ASR	but i certainly know a weirder one
71-2_2441.428_16.26.wav_ASR	that that woman is gonna be tested and graduate and choose out of a lovely woman to be able to be the one that he is decided to marry
71-2_2458.96_11.18.wav_ASR	so anyway all three of these women the two stepsisters and cinderella are going to go
71-2_2470.64_6.62.wav_ASR	and they all start thinking about how wonderful their the situation would be if they could go
71-2_2477.759_2.965.wav_ASR	and and again what's interesting is we're not talking much
71-2_2480.919_2.54.wav_ASR	we're not talking about you know
71-2_2485.819_3.132.wav_ASR	we're not talking about people that are competent with me
71-2_2489.099_5.541.wav_ASR	we're talking about they will soon be attracted enough for this kiss to happen
71-2_2495.14_6.668.wav_ASR	and then their life situation will improve because those are the only options they have
71-2_2502.2_11.34.wav_ASR	and it's a very restrictive situation in in colorado which is very very limiting for me
71-2_2514.72_1.813.wav_ASR	so they're they're all getting ready
71-2_2516.76_1.25.wav_ASR	and they know what they hafta do
71-2_2518.04_0.98.wav_ASR	they have a look at it
71-2_2519.46_1.52.wav_ASR	so they hafta have a really nice one
71-2_2521.32_1.34.wav_ASR	and her hair is to be fixed up
71-2_2522.8_14.67.wav_ASR	and they hafta somehow make them stand out from the other individuals in order to be chosen in this decorative hat or whatever
71-2_2538.05_7.3.wav_ASR	so because the stepmother favors her own daughters she pulls away from cinderella
71-2_2545.61_13.82.wav_ASR	and she gets them the fancy dresses that you know with hair dresses in to get her hair done and stuff like that
71-2_2560.48_2.99.wav_ASR	and cinderella pretty much knows that she can go
71-2_2563.97_8.22.wav_ASR	so she pulls out a book that she got from her mother which has a story in it
71-2_2572.57_8.51.wav_ASR	and because she's very smart and very quiet and because she's had a lot of the medical work done with her
71-2_2581.9_5.18.wav_ASR	so she pulls together some squares of material and stuff like that
71-2_2587.26_3.6.wav_ASR	and she puts together this really cool dress and stuff
71-2_2591.12_1.64.wav_ASR	and i mean it's kind of off the shore
71-2_2593.16_3.109.wav_ASR	you know it's kind of pink which kind of plays off with me
71-2_2597.18_1.602.wav_ASR	and she's ready to go
71-2_2599.24_1.68.wav_ASR	and she's doing the best that she can
71-2_2600.92_1.16.wav_ASR	and that's what she has to do
71-2_2602.7_0.86.wav_ASR	and she's really wet
71-2_2603.98_2.02.wav_ASR	of course her mother is
71-2_2606.3_1.06.wav_ASR	or no surgery
71-2_2609.46_2.94.wav_ASR	you are not of our realm
71-2_2612.88_1.4.wav_ASR	you are a peanut butter
71-2_2615.14_2.22.wav_ASR	and you don't have the right clothes for it
71-2_2617.64_1.2.wav_ASR	you are dressed correctly
71-2_2619.54_0.74.wav_ASR	you are not going to
71-2_2620.5_1.42.wav_ASR	my daughters are good
71-2_2622.98_4.02.wav_ASR	and they the stepsisters of course have gotten their keys back
71-2_2627.22_1.94.wav_ASR	and they know to be really really cool with me
71-2_2629.38_1.02.wav_ASR	so they lapped it up
71-2_2631.4_4.92.wav_ASR	and she goes out in the barn to take care of the animals because that's what she does
71-2_2636.32_4.32.wav_ASR	that's the place where she can go and get some information about what's going on
71-2_2641.04_0.764.wav_ASR	and she's out there
71-2_2642.1_1.3.wav_ASR	you know she's
71-2_2644.4_2.137.wav_ASR	and she's wearing her dress and everything
71-2_2647.06_1.593.wav_ASR	you know she doesn't know what she's gonna do
71-2_2648.78_0.6.wav_ASR	what did she happen
71-2_2649.62_7.806.wav_ASR	what can she possibly do to myself get out of the military police
71-2_2657.46_8.42.wav_ASR	and this fairy godmother appears to her because she is a good person
71-2_2666.1_1.27.wav_ASR	you're giving to other people
71-2_2667.6_1.24.wav_ASR	and she dresses up
71-2_2669.7_4.22.wav_ASR	so this fairy godmother shows up and says
71-2_2674.82_0.58.wav_ASR	how do you call it
71-2_2675.52_0.52.wav_ASR	what's wrong
71-2_2676.1_0.7.wav_ASR	what do you mean
71-2_2677.62_0.66.wav_ASR	and she said
71-2_2678.52_2.04.wav_ASR	and i would like to go to the bathroom
71-2_2680.9_1.26.wav_ASR	but i want to write
71-2_2682.56_1.04.wav_ASR	don't wanna be late
71-2_2683.76_3.48.wav_ASR	well i wanna have the appropriate clothes that i can wear
71-2_2687.6_1.84.wav_ASR	you know you'll be dressed well like everybody else
71-2_2689.8_7.06.wav_ASR	well i want to have the same opportunity that my students have
71-2_2697.8_0.58.wav_ASR	so she said
71-2_2699.7_0.6.wav_ASR	what are you all about
71-2_2700.72_5.86.wav_ASR	and she you know uses her her magic ability to be able to go
71-2_2707.42_0.56.wav_ASR	and she looks at me
71-2_2708.52_7.98.wav_ASR	and she transfers the rats into horses that will be pulling the car
71-2_2716.86_3.12.wav_ASR	and the carriage is transformed from a pumpkin
71-2_2721.2_4.98.wav_ASR	and she uses her wand and and goes overseas
71-2_2726.24_11.79.wav_ASR	and all of a sudden she's wearing these ornate delicate clothes
71-2_2738.29_8.18.wav_ASR	her hair is is made up and the the
71-2_2747.67_2.25.wav_ASR	he's got beautiful makeup on
71-2_2750.27_1.14.wav_ASR	oh she looks gorgeous
71-2_2752.87_4.26.wav_ASR	and her fairy godmother came along
71-2_2758.27_1.606.wav_ASR	go to the bathroom
71-2_2759.97_1.155.wav_ASR	you discover it
71-2_2761.59_3.96.wav_ASR	please understand that this image will only last until midnight
71-2_2766.17_5.725.wav_ASR	at midnight the horses will be transformed back into mice
71-2_2772.51_4.809.wav_ASR	the carriage will be transformed back into a pumpkin
71-2_2778.35_9.98.wav_ASR	and the rags that you're wearing will or the fancy dress that you're wearing will be turned into something else
71-2_2789.37_2.005.wav_ASR	so please help me
71-2_2791.95_0.762.wav_ASR	how do i say it
71-2_2792.712_5.46.wav_ASR	but realize this is just a moment out of time
71-2_2798.512_7.04.wav_ASR	this is a special bullet that that that is hitting the window
71-2_2805.892_1.758.wav_ASR	it's not really gonna change anything
71-2_2808.012_1.558.wav_ASR	oh please enjoy your meal
71-2_2810.63_3.14.wav_ASR	so she hugs the fairy godmother
71-2_2814.41_1.88.wav_ASR	and she gets in the carriage
71-2_2817.21_2.2.wav_ASR	he's taken to the
71-2_2820.33_0.36.wav_ASR	you guess it
71-2_2821.17_8.52.wav_ASR	even her stepsisters don't know who this woman is because she's dressed so magnificent and beautiful
71-2_2830.55_10.16.wav_ASR	all the other people that are watching all they can think of she must be from a really really good place
71-2_2842.35_1.34.wav_ASR	and we don't know if he
71-2_2843.97_3.16.wav_ASR	but she must be from a very high society
71-2_2847.65_1.71.wav_ASR	and she's clearly very beautiful
71-2_2849.56_5.5.wav_ASR	meanwhile the fact that they don't even recognize their own stepdaughters is very interesting
71-2_2855.87_1.702.wav_ASR	and anyway she walks in
71-2_2858.34_8.7.wav_ASR	the prince immediately in his office phone sees the cinderella
71-2_2867.361_0.856.wav_ASR	what's the stand up
71-2_2868.82_1.51.wav_ASR	two she's the one
71-2_2870.72_1.77.wav_ASR	and he hits over the window
71-2_2872.76_1.61.wav_ASR	and he immediately looked at me
71-2_2874.58_5.47.wav_ASR	see that she's all so beautiful on top of being really lovely and everything
71-2_2880.91_1.45.wav_ASR	and she's also great
71-2_2882.78_0.91.wav_ASR	and she's a wonderful girl
71-2_2884.34_0.31.wav_ASR	car tire car
71-2_2885.36_1.74.wav_ASR	there's an anti medication
71-2_2887.88_2.89.wav_ASR	and there's there's communication between them
71-2_2891.62_0.875.wav_ASR	and he said
71-2_2893.18_1.008.wav_ASR	he's thinking at his mind
71-2_2894.42_1.321.wav_ASR	how i thought this was gonna be awesome
71-2_2896.04_2.52.wav_ASR	and i thought this was gonna be a dirty day
71-2_2898.78_2.795.wav_ASR	but i really like it
71-2_2902.0_1.34.wav_ASR	and this is this
71-2_2903.86_2.26.wav_ASR	was hoping for something this mix
71-2_2906.281_1.956.wav_ASR	and i was prepared for something to happen
71-2_2908.461_1.931.wav_ASR	and this just can't be
71-2_2910.761_2.955.wav_ASR	so he wants to spend time with her as much as he can
71-2_2913.941_0.479.wav_ASR	how to say it
71-2_2914.681_0.98.wav_ASR	and she's into it too
71-2_2915.801_1.52.wav_ASR	and they're they're really convenient
71-2_2917.761_1.52.wav_ASR	it's just this wonderful bike
71-2_2920.001_4.289.wav_ASR	and then she looks up at the clock and sees that it's five o'clock
71-2_2926.49_28.8.wav_ASR	and she knows that she's really not this legal notice that she lives in as soon as he sees her a little while ago
71-2_2956.938_4.418.wav_ASR	he she knows that that illusion will also fade away
71-2_2961.538_9.22.wav_ASR	and she she's pretty sure that what he really wanted is the the tripping the animals all around the place
71-2_2971.438_5.015.wav_ASR	so she knows that as soon as she sees who she really is she goes home
71-2_2976.453_4.78.wav_ASR	so she raises away as quickly as she can because she wants to go home
71-2_2981.093_8.34.wav_ASR	and she doesn't wanna see the look in her eye when she sees who she really is and what her real status is you know
71-2_2990.23_2.14.wav_ASR	so he doesn't understand me
71-2_2992.653_0.437.wav_ASR	where's she going
71-2_2993.173_0.717.wav_ASR	what did he see
71-2_2994.053_1.277.wav_ASR	did you say something to me
71-2_2995.46_1.51.wav_ASR	where's she at
71-2_2997.36_6.02.wav_ASR	and she raises away as quickly as she can so quickly that she trips and falls
71-2_3003.6_0.62.wav_ASR	and she tried it on
71-2_3004.74_1.712.wav_ASR	and her shoe falls off
71-2_3006.6_1.342.wav_ASR	and she doesn't have time to grab it
71-2_3008.32_0.93.wav_ASR	and she's gonna get gone
71-2_3009.56_0.89.wav_ASR	and she's gonna get away
71-2_3010.96_1.49.wav_ASR	so she makes it around the clock
71-2_3012.45_3.64.wav_ASR	and immediately i thought
71-2_3016.65_9.027.wav_ASR	the ball dress is transformed back into cinderella
71-2_3025.677_7.746.wav_ASR	the pumpkin luckily she didn't get in it because i don't know what would've happened if she went in there
71-2_3033.917_1.461.wav_ASR	it's a
71-2_3035.637_0.493.wav_ASR	it's a pumpkin
71-2_3036.697_2.343.wav_ASR	and the the horses are there
71-2_3039.7_1.22.wav_ASR	they're rats in there
71-2_3041.9_5.82.wav_ASR	so she walks home sneaks in the back because you know they don't really care about her
71-2_3047.96_2.44.wav_ASR	and she could be out in the barn with the animals
71-2_3051.18_1.98.wav_ASR	and she remembers her name
71-2_3053.64_0.44.wav_ASR	and she said
71-2_3054.52_2.96.wav_ASR	okay i got to see what it was like to be on the other side of the room
71-2_3058.28_1.562.wav_ASR	well maybe i can be considered
71-2_3059.842_2.694.wav_ASR	or maybe there's some other way that i can get out of here
71-2_3062.542_1.178.wav_ASR	at least i had it
71-2_3064.362_9.62.wav_ASR	at least i know that if i had the opportunity clothes i could walk in a style at that point in time
71-2_3075.322_2.431.wav_ASR	the next time he's back in the house
71-2_3078.142_1.402.wav_ASR	he's chasing after her
71-2_3079.8_11.914.wav_ASR	it's you know kind of the sociology of what's going on in his brain is got all this information that all at this one it doesn't make sense to him
71-2_3092.42_1.26.wav_ASR	so there's kind of a mystery
71-2_3093.8_0.92.wav_ASR	and he stopped the shoe
71-2_3095.48_0.44.wav_ASR	and he says
71-2_3096.62_2.419.wav_ASR	well i want that one
71-2_3099.039_1.554.wav_ASR	and he says that to his friend
71-2_3101.459_0.874.wav_ASR	well i will get married
71-2_3102.659_1.457.wav_ASR	well do everything you want me to do
71-2_3104.319_1.26.wav_ASR	follow my opinion
71-2_3106.019_2.317.wav_ASR	but i'm only gonna marry a woman i wanna marry
71-2_3108.479_1.188.wav_ASR	and i decided who to marry
71-2_3109.899_0.481.wav_ASR	it's hurt
71-2_3110.579_0.492.wav_ASR	the prince
71-2_3111.559_1.82.wav_ASR	my sister and i
71-2_3113.739_1.359.wav_ASR	and i got her shoe
71-2_3115.098_9.104.wav_ASR	so all i hafta do is go around and see if i can figure out who's fit who's foot fits the slipper
71-2_3124.478_2.226.wav_ASR	and then that will be the problem
71-2_3126.704_14.559.wav_ASR	and because he's beginning to understand in his mind that there are some limitations of this situation which is that they're not going to be able to do anything
71-2_3141.263_17.44.wav_ASR	and he's beginning to think if the their cells could just be so old soulmates that that could even relate to each other in some way
71-2_3158.75_4.86.wav_ASR	so he's thinking at this point he's thinking much more better than he was
71-2_3163.91_2.82.wav_ASR	and so they've got this this
71-2_3167.87_7.62.wav_ASR	if he can find a woman who's feet fit into those glass slippers he'll marry her
71-2_3175.61_0.918.wav_ASR	and then i'll look at her again
71-2_3176.528_4.36.wav_ASR	and he'll be able to know that that's the person that is his father
71-2_3181.928_1.599.wav_ASR	and that's the person that he will be
71-2_3184.23_8.169.wav_ASR	and because the way society works is if you're rich you can marry down but if you're poor you can't
71-2_3192.59_7.512.wav_ASR	if you're poor and you wanna marry up you're gonna be very happy
71-2_3200.21_5.812.wav_ASR	so you pretty much need someone right to reach down and get it
71-2_3207.09_0.38.wav_ASR	so
71-2_3208.27_0.924.wav_ASR	he's mad
71-2_3209.37_0.56.wav_ASR	you spread it out
71-2_3210.23_5.02.wav_ASR	and given the paper mill licenses of them she doesn't know what's going on
71-2_3215.67_1.58.wav_ASR	he hasta ask her
71-2_3217.53_2.64.wav_ASR	and this goes back two days
71-2_3220.23_10.62.wav_ASR	and this is the way in which europe organized their society to turn it into something more
71-2_3232.95_1.66.wav_ASR	so he's going to school
71-2_3234.63_9.058.wav_ASR	and of course this is really a really interesting way to find the partner that he's actually looking for the mystery girl
71-2_3244.37_1.53.wav_ASR	but he's all else what to do
71-2_3246.27_1.395.wav_ASR	and i mean he's irritated
71-2_3248.05_0.952.wav_ASR	do you want the one i want
71-2_3249.19_4.215.wav_ASR	who saw the woman you know with the the fairy godmother
71-2_3253.405_1.7.wav_ASR	and he useta call this doctor
71-2_3255.445_1.264.wav_ASR	everybody's looking for me
71-2_3256.825_0.684.wav_ASR	they can't find me
71-2_3258.025_3.705.wav_ASR	so we're gonna start with the the shoe because he's got something in his hand
71-2_3262.625_10.345.wav_ASR	and they invite that he will be going city to city to see if a woman would come forward to marry the prince
71-2_3273.59_2.54.wav_ASR	so of course the stepdaughters
71-2_3276.77_4.492.wav_ASR	he passed away the next day
71-2_3281.67_5.34.wav_ASR	but all we gotta do at this point is get our feet to fit in the shoes
71-2_3287.15_7.66.wav_ASR	and of course there's looking at this in a really superficial kind of way because he finds the right one for her
71-2_3298.01_6.16.wav_ASR	and clearly even if those shoes did fit the stepdaughters they were too big
71-2_3304.47_1.08.wav_ASR	there's a new one
71-2_3305.92_1.24.wav_ASR	they'd be no calories
71-2_3307.5_1.43.wav_ASR	but you know they don't understand
71-2_3309.14_4.5.wav_ASR	they're really behind in terms of understanding people
71-2_3314.91_9.46.wav_ASR	and cinderella is she knows if she has the opportunity to connect with him again he can take her out of this place
71-2_3324.63_1.94.wav_ASR	and they didn't care
71-2_3326.99_0.66.wav_ASR	they shouldn't
71-2_3327.87_0.666.wav_ASR	what they did
71-2_3328.77_1.6.wav_ASR	it was very interesting
71-2_3331.15_16.88.wav_ASR	but for whatever reason because of the fairy godmother she's been given that opportunity to step out of her role and move into a beautiful place
71-2_3349.85_4.94.wav_ASR	so when they come up to the house both of the stepsisters
71-2_3355.33_3.9.wav_ASR	maybe try very hard to see if their feet will fit in it
71-2_3359.65_1.118.wav_ASR	and they they don't
71-2_3361.07_2.251.wav_ASR	doing everything that he could do
71-2_3363.39_2.46.wav_ASR	and at this point the prince is just very happy
71-2_3366.67_1.663.wav_ASR	doesn't think he's ever gonna find her
71-2_3368.45_4.78.wav_ASR	and he'll be stuck with somebody else that his father will probably marry again
71-2_3374.21_1.02.wav_ASR	and he finally said
71-2_3375.45_9.07.wav_ASR	there's another woman in this house who could possibly be cinderella
71-2_3385.34_2.26.wav_ASR	and cinderella steps in
71-2_3388.1_5.46.wav_ASR	and this is the best thing she's ever done because her stepmother is just gonna punish her and everything
71-2_3394.22_0.66.wav_ASR	and she said
71-2_3395.354_0.61.wav_ASR	and i'm here
71-2_3396.64_1.68.wav_ASR	and the stepmother turns and looks
71-2_3398.32_11.3.wav_ASR	and she's right to you know collect her and and answer her out to the barn for a while because i don't know how to eat for a while
71-2_3410.66_4.26.wav_ASR	but the person that's working with me is great
71-2_3415.8_1.04.wav_ASR	and he said everything
71-2_3417.006_1.52.wav_ASR	uhhuh i'm not
71-2_3419.206_5.75.wav_ASR	and she steps forward despite the fact that she's being glare at by the prince
71-2_3426.49_1.26.wav_ASR	and she sits down
71-2_3428.266_4.56.wav_ASR	and her foot fits the slipper
71-2_3433.786_1.224.wav_ASR	the prince looks at her
71-2_3435.486_0.884.wav_ASR	her eyes me
71-2_3437.19_5.92.wav_ASR	and one again he knows he's my best friend
71-2_3444.51_11.84.wav_ASR	and at that point all of the power that the prince has to be able to protect her from his stepmother
71-2_3457.31_6.494.wav_ASR	all of her beautiful clothes come back though we're beginning to think this might have been an announcement or something
71-2_3465.03_1.22.wav_ASR	the stepmother said
71-2_3467.17_0.966.wav_ASR	is out of my hand
71-2_3468.27_3.048.wav_ASR	well i had no idea to pronounce it that way
71-2_3471.91_15.74.wav_ASR	and the prince pulls her out of there and brings her back to the palace where she will be grown up as a princess
71-2_3488.11_2.18.wav_ASR	and she's gonna have to learn how to
71-2_3490.38_2.51.wav_ASR	or she's gonna learn how to talk
71-2_3493.22_6.463.wav_ASR	and she's gonna have to learn how to contribute to the family
71-2_3500.06_5.22.wav_ASR	all the things that are associated with a higher grade of school
71-2_3505.28_7.11.wav_ASR	but because they connect at a human level it's very good
71-2_3569.68_4.16.wav_ASR	it was just thinking about telling you about the one that happened to me
71-2_3574.16_1.744.wav_ASR	so i hafta come up with the number in my head
71-2_3575.904_16.746.wav_ASR	when i was in the third grade which means i was about eighteen i was very good with my writing
71-2_3594.17_4.66.wav_ASR	but there were some details that i was not completely clear about
71-2_3599.49_5.1.wav_ASR	and one of those is what is a cover afternoo
71-2_3606.01_7.8.wav_ASR	and i mean i certainly knew that the shorter handel or whatever you call it
71-2_3614.27_3.18.wav_ASR	and the long handrail was there
71-2_3618.41_10.9.wav_ASR	but from my perspective from my eighty old brain when someone said twenty five afternoons i couldn't speak at all
71-2_3629.95_0.94.wav_ASR	didn't mean fifty
71-2_3632.237_7.116.wav_ASR	and what it happened is my older sister was had stayed home with the kids
71-2_3640.43_4.54.wav_ASR	and i was sposta go to her elementary school
71-2_3645.277_2.053.wav_ASR	and she was in the fifth
71-2_3647.95_6.86.wav_ASR	and i was sposta get her home home and bring it home to her so that she could do a work and everything else
71-2_3655.69_1.8.wav_ASR	and so i went to my teacher again
71-2_3657.81_4.4.wav_ASR	and i'm sposta go to firstnamem's house
71-2_3662.55_3.64.wav_ASR	and i'm supposed to pick up my sister's cat
71-2_3667.09_0.66.wav_ASR	and she said
71-2_3668.13_1.372.wav_ASR	why didn't you go to california
71-2_3669.502_1.648.wav_ASR	so i said
71-2_3671.37_0.632.wav_ASR	okay i will
71-2_3672.79_7.687.wav_ASR	after a few five minutes after because in my mind i thought
71-2_3680.63_1.36.wav_ASR	forty five miles an hour
71-2_3682.55_2.16.wav_ASR	four a quarter is worth twenty five cents
71-2_3685.29_6.464.wav_ASR	so court after would be three twenty five not three fifty or so
71-2_3691.83_1.241.wav_ASR	cover after the umbrella
71-2_3693.83_6.8.wav_ASR	so i waited till three twenty five which is five minutes before the school was going to leave
71-2_3701.57_3.218.wav_ASR	it's way too late for me to be going and doing what i'm supposed to be doing
71-2_3704.71_1.76.wav_ASR	and i was sposta do it ten minutes a day
71-2_3706.77_5.92.wav_ASR	well i'm watching the clock till exactly three twenty five and getting up and going to do something else
71-2_3713.17_1.54.wav_ASR	and i ran out
71-2_3715.13_4.3.wav_ASR	of course it's a mess because i'm missing the end of the year
71-2_3720.41_4.7.wav_ASR	her class is firstnamel's class is firstnamer's class
71-2_3726.15_4.02.wav_ASR	and so i get back to my class probably at three or four o'clock
71-2_3730.99_3.236.wav_ASR	my teacher is still waiting there because my stuff is still here
71-2_3734.91_1.24.wav_ASR	did you wait so long
71-2_3736.33_0.6.wav_ASR	and she said
71-2_3737.07_2.17.wav_ASR	actually when you told me that
71-2_3739.78_1.66.wav_ASR	you told me to go to kootenay
71-2_3742.38_0.58.wav_ASR	and she said
71-2_3743.24_2.52.wav_ASR	oh no you didn't go til three twenty five
71-2_3746.02_0.42.wav_ASR	and i said
71-2_3746.78_1.46.wav_ASR	but isn't that quartet
71-2_3749.18_19.93.wav_ASR	and so at the age of eight i understood finally that when firstnamel said copyright and they're dressing or returning to a clock that they meet fifty minutes after twelve o'clock
71-2_3769.95_0.381.wav_ASR	how's that
71-2_3770.47_0.576.wav_ASR	how i don't know
71-2_3783.83_0.927.wav_ASR	well what to me
71-2_3784.77_0.667.wav_ASR	and i was eighteen
71-2_3785.65_0.876.wav_ASR	still makes sense
71-2_3786.87_2.118.wav_ASR	you should've said you know cut after the one
71-2_3788.988_1.9.wav_ASR	what do you call the white people
71-2_3791.248_1.687.wav_ASR	they just aren't clear about it
71-2_3793.668_2.282.wav_ASR	now that i actually talk better
71-2_3796.328_1.262.wav_ASR	you know i was an accountant
71-2_3797.748_1.362.wav_ASR	you never talk back to anyone
71-2_3799.368_1.8.wav_ASR	well i was just really confused
71-2_3809.35_6.62.wav_ASR	and i think that's all
71-2_3816.149_18.351.wav_ASR	when i think to talk about this story i think i'm going to talk about when i learned how to write a turkey because at that time it was very difficult for me to write
71-2_3836.08_11.38.wav_ASR	and of course growing up in an expensive family where we had very very high taxes i never made my own money
71-2_3847.78_2.32.wav_ASR	my generally we would go to my grandmother's house
71-2_3850.98_1.12.wav_ASR	and she had eleven children
71-2_3852.94_2.427.wav_ASR	so our jelly
71-2_3855.367_3.059.wav_ASR	my father was the second oldest of the three
71-2_3859.04_2.22.wav_ASR	our job was to bring some people
71-2_3861.92_7.327.wav_ASR	and usually we would bring something else whether it be cranberry or something else like that
71-2_3869.707_2.393.wav_ASR	we never made any
71-2_3872.607_2.173.wav_ASR	you were never sensitive for doing that kind of stuff
71-2_3874.78_1.654.wav_ASR	and then we're we're talking
71-2_3876.434_0.914.wav_ASR	they're pretty funny
71-2_3877.82_5.48.wav_ASR	you know i'd hang up with my in the kitchen with the women because they were kind of nice to me
71-2_3883.46_1.96.wav_ASR	and the man would be in the living room watching tv
71-2_3886.28_4.902.wav_ASR	and yeah you would just try to deal with those people
71-2_3891.42_2.44.wav_ASR	but anyway i was by myself
71-2_3893.937_6.46.wav_ASR	well i think i was a senior in high school
71-2_3903.017_2.6.wav_ASR	and i was working as a manager
71-2_3906.217_1.753.wav_ASR	and i didn't have a stroke
71-2_3909.03_2.46.wav_ASR	and i couldn't get enough time off for work
71-2_3911.917_1.736.wav_ASR	they didn't have enough cinderella to go
71-2_3913.653_4.9.wav_ASR	so for whatever reason i hadta work on wednesday because that's my day
71-2_3919.253_1.48.wav_ASR	and i was gonna be depressed
71-2_3920.873_2.933.wav_ASR	well i was gonna miss this big family all the time
71-2_3924.413_4.96.wav_ASR	but i decided that i was still going to make sure that i had a stroke
71-2_3929.773_1.74.wav_ASR	but i still had no
71-2_3931.715_1.84.wav_ASR	but i still had
71-2_3934.135_1.48.wav_ASR	that i still had speech
71-2_3935.995_1.437.wav_ASR	and those are the things i liked about it
71-2_3937.995_2.438.wav_ASR	so i was gonna go through this because now i'm an adult
71-2_3940.455_1.144.wav_ASR	and i know how to do all that
71-2_3941.995_1.475.wav_ASR	and why shouldn't i be able to do that
71-2_3943.535_0.973.wav_ASR	it can't be horror
71-2_3945.135_1.145.wav_ASR	it comes out the way it is
71-2_3946.495_1.92.wav_ASR	it looks like you turn the knob
71-2_3948.615_1.065.wav_ASR	you put the toothpaste
71-2_3949.895_1.065.wav_ASR	you leave it in for a long time
71-2_3951.06_1.38.wav_ASR	five and eventually you pull it out
71-2_3952.98_1.427.wav_ASR	and then you eat it right away
71-2_3954.407_0.765.wav_ASR	can i do that
71-2_3956.5_5.3.wav_ASR	so the tuesday before thanksgiving i went home
71-2_3962.12_0.88.wav_ASR	and everybody says
71-2_3963.12_1.013.wav_ASR	you're not gonna be
71-2_3964.3_1.612.wav_ASR	well i can't believe you're not gonna be happy
71-2_3965.912_1.841.wav_ASR	and i'm feeling all the different and all that
71-2_3967.94_2.64.wav_ASR	but i get how i pick up this slipper
71-2_3970.948_2.557.wav_ASR	and i don't get a particular feeling
71-2_3973.708_0.995.wav_ASR	but it's pretty big
71-2_3974.748_3.832.wav_ASR	probably twenty pounds which is certainly more than i have
71-2_3979.388_1.599.wav_ASR	but you know i thought
71-2_3981.128_5.18.wav_ASR	smaller than the one that my family has ever used before
71-2_3986.648_1.44.wav_ASR	so i pick up this slipper
71-2_3989.32_4.94.wav_ASR	after i get home from work on wednesday i put on my pajamas
71-2_3994.86_1.6.wav_ASR	you know kind of see where i'm going here and there
71-2_3997.14_1.16.wav_ASR	and i'm walking out of the fireman
71-2_3998.92_0.655.wav_ASR	and she said
71-2_3999.94_8.707.wav_ASR	well i think i put it in the morning on thursday morning i should be able to eat probably until midnight
71-2_4008.6_3.427.wav_ASR	and you know i heard you know how to make pies and all that stuff
71-2_4012.36_2.28.wav_ASR	and i stick it in the jelly
71-2_4015.16_2.54.wav_ASR	and i put firstnamet phone away
71-2_4018.12_1.74.wav_ASR	and i got the temperature back
71-2_4020.98_0.76.wav_ASR	and i put it in
71-2_4022.48_2.3.wav_ASR	and you know in the meantime i'm getting really sick
71-2_4025.22_1.08.wav_ASR	see the day is going on
71-2_4026.96_2.58.wav_ASR	the other smells really bad
71-2_4030.16_1.799.wav_ASR	well i've already got the pins and needles
71-2_4032.82_2.322.wav_ASR	so i bought the pies because i didn't have time to make them
71-2_4035.7_1.44.wav_ASR	and i go to the hospital
71-2_4037.36_0.82.wav_ASR	and i'm watching tv
71-2_4038.6_1.326.wav_ASR	and so it's about four o'clock
71-2_4040.14_5.623.wav_ASR	and i invited my nextdoor neighbor to come over and help thanksgiving with me
71-2_4045.6_2.7.wav_ASR	and i pulled it up
71-2_4048.88_8.18.wav_ASR	and i open the other door pull out the the turkey and put it in the oven
71-2_4058.22_5.156.wav_ASR	and all of a sudden i notice that it's still kinda rained
71-2_4063.76_1.56.wav_ASR	and i said
71-2_4065.473_3.02.wav_ASR	and what apparently i didn't understand you hadta tell me
71-2_4068.773_3.506.wav_ASR	well i i didn't know that there's actually a process that you can go through
71-2_4072.673_10.555.wav_ASR	so what i have is a turkey which is overcooked on the bottom completely uncooked
71-2_4083.413_1.1.wav_ASR	there's blood everywhere
71-2_4084.791_4.6.wav_ASR	or you know when you wheeled it is fine have good wheels
71-2_4089.731_1.877.wav_ASR	well i'm having blood coming out of my head
71-2_4092.3_1.672.wav_ASR	so i've got my next door neighbor
71-2_4094.631_1.127.wav_ASR	so when are we gonna eat
71-2_4095.771_0.429.wav_ASR	and i said
71-2_4096.271_1.769.wav_ASR	well it looks like a lot of things
71-2_4098.231_1.569.wav_ASR	and i don't know why's taking this to me
71-2_4101.011_1.629.wav_ASR	and i said
71-2_4103.091_0.989.wav_ASR	well let's just see the picture
71-2_4104.66_1.34.wav_ASR	so i put it back in the jar
71-2_4106.3_0.82.wav_ASR	we ate the pizza
71-2_4107.6_2.94.wav_ASR	we started eating you know whatever i got in the hospital
71-2_4110.92_3.32.wav_ASR	and i keep opening the other door and going in
71-2_4114.46_1.1.wav_ASR	you're not done yet
71-2_4115.9_3.62.wav_ASR	and finally at this point my daughter
71-2_4119.66_2.687.wav_ASR	you know i'm not really hungry anymore because we've been there
71-2_4122.347_5.32.wav_ASR	and i think i had some medication and cheese and the peanut butter
71-2_4127.947_0.653.wav_ASR	we need it now
71-2_4128.987_0.853.wav_ASR	you're already had the peanut butter
71-2_4130.887_1.513.wav_ASR	you know we're eating other things
71-2_4132.587_2.053.wav_ASR	think we're drinking beer pretty much at that time
71-2_4135.127_1.673.wav_ASR	and it still just wasn't
71-2_4136.987_0.32.wav_ASR	well i said
71-2_4137.427_1.789.wav_ASR	think there's something wrong with my arm
71-2_4139.216_4.64.wav_ASR	for whatever reason this bird did not go away
71-2_4144.716_6.64.wav_ASR	so basically i finally took it out of the envelope and said
71-2_4152.1_1.576.wav_ASR	it was half close
71-2_4154.1_6.54.wav_ASR	and then i found out the next day from my aunt that it was supposed to be called probably thursday
71-2_4161.66_3.14.wav_ASR	and that's the only way that it's cool to me
71-2_4164.8_10.968.wav_ASR	and i never told anybody other than my aunt that the reason that my tooth did not work out is not good for me
71-2_4175.98_2.66.wav_ASR	because i told the engineer just didn't work
71-2_4178.98_0.94.wav_ASR	and that's the point
71-2_4180.26_1.499.wav_ASR	that's the one i went with her
71-2_4181.86_0.46.wav_ASR	and i did not
71-2_4182.62_1.64.wav_ASR	they would've laughed at me for that
71-2_4184.269_5.704.wav_ASR	they'd recorded me for decades for not knowing something as bad as it could be
71-2_4190.749_3.091.wav_ASR	but it's the first bird i heard
71-2_4194.709_2.56.wav_ASR	there's there's you needta tell the doctor
71-2_4197.749_2.931.wav_ASR	meanwhile there's more involved than just sticking in the
71-2_4201.309_1.4.wav_ASR	so let's wait a minute
71-2_4202.869_1.276.wav_ASR	you know i didn't even talk to him
71-2_4204.145_0.66.wav_ASR	so i didn't take it
71-2_4205.385_11.22.wav_ASR	the next one was actually inside paper and was stuck inside the jelly jar which i didn't even know what was going on
71-2_4217.465_4.355.wav_ASR	when i finally was able to get it out i had paper in there too
71-2_4222.245_1.467.wav_ASR	cut cut them up
71-2_4223.712_2.033.wav_ASR	actually i ate it up
71-2_4225.772_5.36.wav_ASR	and i just hated it up then kind of kicked it up and said
71-2_4231.613_1.392.wav_ASR	so i didn't use it
71-2_4244.36_0.39.wav_ASR	and she said
71-2_4246.12_3.22.wav_ASR	what's her name
71-2_4250.31_12.91.wav_ASR	and i'm going to talk about hotel that i stayed in when i was living in cuba and was traveling with my husband
71-2_4263.273_6.26.wav_ASR	now in this particular case what it happened is we were at the hospital
71-2_4270.133_3.68.wav_ASR	so we had a month off in which there were no schools
71-2_4274.793_1.429.wav_ASR	and so all of a sudden
71-2_4276.413_2.08.wav_ASR	we were about twenty five of us there
71-2_4278.663_5.439.wav_ASR	we were between the ages of ninetyone and ninety seven
71-2_4284.483_8.28.wav_ASR	and we have the ability to be able to buy uniforms which is very good
71-2_4293.323_0.72.wav_ASR	you're basically
71-2_4294.543_3.437.wav_ASR	and i can't remember what it costs at the hospital
71-2_4297.98_2.54.wav_ASR	but i think it was about hundred dollars you know
71-2_4300.82_16.44.wav_ASR	and you could essentially go anywhere as far south as georgia and as far north as florida
71-2_4317.626_3.34.wav_ASR	so you know we had all these ways of trying to do it
71-2_4321.286_2.024.wav_ASR	you know we'd sleep on trees
71-2_4323.546_4.404.wav_ASR	we would take things at night so that we wouldn't hafta worry about them during the day
71-2_4328.866_1.9.wav_ASR	but we were there
71-2_4331.086_2.44.wav_ASR	we were several of us that were there
71-2_4333.686_1.58.wav_ASR	it was with a friend called firstnamek
71-2_4335.298_4.36.wav_ASR	and we were connecting with firstnamel and firstnamec
71-2_4339.721_2.975.wav_ASR	and and we were there
71-2_4342.838_1.313.wav_ASR	they had traveled from somewhere else
71-2_4344.198_2.045.wav_ASR	we're all gonna meet together in one place
71-2_4346.718_4.949.wav_ASR	and we figured we would all stay in a hotel together to see the movie
71-2_4351.738_2.52.wav_ASR	you would have two kids
71-2_4354.57_1.472.wav_ASR	so there was a kid
71-2_4356.47_1.518.wav_ASR	and one of us would sleep with him
71-2_4357.988_3.735.wav_ASR	and and then two women would be in the other one
71-2_4362.65_1.8.wav_ASR	so it's neurology right
71-2_4364.61_1.672.wav_ASR	because this is firstnamec's sister
71-2_4366.73_2.06.wav_ASR	we arrived in houston
71-2_4369.51_2.46.wav_ASR	and the first thing we we would do is
71-2_4372.105_3.44.wav_ASR	and we were gonna meet with each other at the train station
71-2_4376.45_1.74.wav_ASR	we all met at the train station
71-2_4378.485_2.025.wav_ASR	we all got in with a half an hour away from each other
71-2_4380.725_0.585.wav_ASR	we kicked it
71-2_4381.31_17.334.wav_ASR	the first thing we would always do is go to the information center and get the map and find out what's going on in the city and where the key hotel is located
71-2_4399.31_1.66.wav_ASR	well there's a guy there walking
71-2_4400.97_1.48.wav_ASR	and he was about twelve
71-2_4402.65_5.436.wav_ASR	very traditional american man and woman
71-2_4408.77_2.324.wav_ASR	and he was just starting flailing with this to start with
71-2_4410.93_1.58.wav_ASR	so there're three American women
71-2_4412.97_0.805.wav_ASR	the one guy
71-2_4414.09_1.187.wav_ASR	and he's traveling with me
71-2_4415.73_2.32.wav_ASR	and he said
71-2_4418.51_1.44.wav_ASR	oh you're gonna be in
71-2_4420.19_0.352.wav_ASR	and we said
71-2_4420.542_1.785.wav_ASR	yeah we're gonna be in a couple of weeks
71-2_4423.022_0.528.wav_ASR	are you planning to plan
71-2_4423.642_1.191.wav_ASR	well we don't have pictures
71-2_4425.142_0.92.wav_ASR	we're just traveling
71-2_4426.362_1.68.wav_ASR	and we're open to anything
71-2_4428.462_0.4.wav_ASR	and he said
71-2_4428.922_1.677.wav_ASR	we're gonna be having a party tonight
71-2_4431.182_1.62.wav_ASR	would you like to come to our party
71-2_4433.777_1.345.wav_ASR	and of course he said
71-2_4435.601_1.401.wav_ASR	of course we'll come to your party
71-2_4437.262_1.273.wav_ASR	we don't know anybody
71-2_4438.722_1.324.wav_ASR	of course we'll come to your party
71-2_4440.046_0.685.wav_ASR	what's your idea
71-2_4440.731_1.855.wav_ASR	we loved to go to an italian restaurant
71-2_4442.966_1.106.wav_ASR	and you know
71-2_4444.486_4.06.wav_ASR	well i've seen the movie the tea and tea which means it could go on forever
71-2_4448.786_0.842.wav_ASR	that's not what happened
71-2_4450.606_1.32.wav_ASR	so we get to our hotel
71-2_4453.086_0.895.wav_ASR	and we checked in
71-2_4454.966_4.62.wav_ASR	and the guy behind the desk looked at all of us and said
71-2_4459.59_1.88.wav_ASR	do you all wanna be in one room with me
71-2_4462.21_0.62.wav_ASR	and we said
71-2_4463.448_1.886.wav_ASR	one one room two people
71-2_4466.53_1.558.wav_ASR	and he looked at kindergarten
71-2_4468.088_2.082.wav_ASR	and he pulled him aside and said
71-2_4470.79_1.3.wav_ASR	you must not be an attorney
71-2_4472.41_4.094.wav_ASR	if i was in that room i would not be able to sleep the entire night
71-2_4476.504_3.19.wav_ASR	they're tired night with all of these beautiful people
71-2_4480.57_2.338.wav_ASR	and firstnamec he hadn't come out yet
71-2_4482.944_3.806.wav_ASR	but it about a year later after that when we all had a stroke
71-2_4487.104_0.926.wav_ASR	now i'm i'm gay
71-2_4488.81_0.614.wav_ASR	and i said
71-2_4489.544_1.514.wav_ASR	oh we we didn't know it
71-2_4491.584_4.638.wav_ASR	yeah then i was thinking at the time you know he he actually didn't know what was going on
71-2_4496.25_7.099.wav_ASR	but he said one of the things that made clear to him that was gay as far as i know
71-2_4504.19_3.358.wav_ASR	it wouldn't be able to sleep if i was in the room with these beautiful people
71-2_4508.07_0.96.wav_ASR	and he was thinking
71-2_4509.29_1.838.wav_ASR	you know i'm not interested in that anymore
71-2_4511.51_1.94.wav_ASR	yes eventually i thought
71-2_4513.97_1.867.wav_ASR	well maybe there's a reason for it
71-2_4515.85_1.695.wav_ASR	yeah but i don't know
71-2_4518.19_2.637.wav_ASR	so we i actually stopped going to church
71-2_4520.91_0.704.wav_ASR	oh that was
71-2_4523.37_1.48.wav_ASR	and i mean there's a girl
71-2_4525.51_3.045.wav_ASR	well it didn't matter what we were going to do
71-2_4528.59_1.436.wav_ASR	he was like my brother at that point
71-2_4530.79_1.74.wav_ASR	so firstnamec and i slept in one bed
71-2_4532.73_0.64.wav_ASR	it was a dog
71-2_4533.83_2.42.wav_ASR	and firstnamed and firstnamec slept in the same room
71-2_4536.43_6.242.wav_ASR	and we put all our stuff up you know our backsplashes and all that
71-2_4542.95_1.454.wav_ASR	and then we all went to this party
71-2_4544.65_2.441.wav_ASR	and everybody's really well dressed at this party
71-2_4547.69_2.18.wav_ASR	you wear jeans
71-2_4558.543_1.81.wav_ASR	everybody's all mad at her
71-2_4560.543_2.446.wav_ASR	and there we are looking like this
71-2_4563.963_5.82.wav_ASR	and the whole thing at the party became a big deal
71-2_4569.795_5.22.wav_ASR	so this guy is sleeping with all three of us in the bed
71-2_4575.455_8.129.wav_ASR	well that's all we talked about all night was just that firstnamek had three different women in the house
71-2_4583.835_2.445.wav_ASR	and so you know but
71-2_4586.535_3.105.wav_ASR	well i could be an American man and travel with him
71-2_4589.64_1.073.wav_ASR	and you know it
71-2_4591.62_1.186.wav_ASR	my cousin was so embarrassed
71-2_4593.08_2.472.wav_ASR	oh oh so interesting by the way
71-2_4595.68_0.879.wav_ASR	we
71-2_4597.78_4.75.wav_ASR	what's interesting is on the way back we stopped again and said
71-2_4602.76_3.63.wav_ASR	firstnamek came out of the bathroom the men's bathroom
71-2_4607.06_1.72.wav_ASR	well i just had the stroke already
71-2_4609.0_0.74.wav_ASR	and we said
71-2_4609.96_0.5.wav_ASR	help me
71-2_4610.475_1.125.wav_ASR	so i said
71-2_4611.66_1.84.wav_ASR	well i was at the university
71-2_4614.02_1.751.wav_ASR	and i was standing
71-2_4615.94_0.733.wav_ASR	and i was peeing
71-2_4617.72_1.59.wav_ASR	and all of a sudden this man said
71-2_4619.54_4.24.wav_ASR	and he could have gone to the other side of the road
71-2_4624.08_1.411.wav_ASR	he came and stood right next to me
71-2_4626.74_0.6.wav_ASR	and he said
71-2_4627.405_1.298.wav_ASR	and i don't know what that is
71-2_4628.703_0.68.wav_ASR	and so i said
71-2_4630.703_0.392.wav_ASR	oh my god
71-2_4631.095_1.208.wav_ASR	it's italian you know
71-2_4632.523_0.44.wav_ASR	and he said
71-2_4633.223_4.051.wav_ASR	and he had the biggest peanut butter i ever saw
71-2_4637.563_0.429.wav_ASR	uhhuh
71-2_4638.163_1.275.wav_ASR	so i'm not sure
71-2_4640.283_2.322.wav_ASR	thinking about that a year later it kind of amazed me
71-2_4642.723_0.997.wav_ASR	at the time it was
71-2_4643.84_0.556.wav_ASR	can i do it
71-2_4644.543_1.18.wav_ASR	yes this is what it tells me
71-2_4645.732_10.149.wav_ASR	and we just thought adult men were so strange that somebody would not be able to sleep in a fulltime job and not be able to do anything
71-2_4656.872_1.771.wav_ASR	could not sleep if i was in bed
71-2_4658.952_2.411.wav_ASR	well i just couldn't imagine all those women in there
71-2_4661.432_1.043.wav_ASR	we were sharing a bathroom
71-2_4663.072_0.5.wav_ASR	oh my god
71-2_4663.885_1.9.wav_ASR	so anyway
71-2_4665.989_3.342.wav_ASR	that's better than the one where i was
71-2_4669.685_0.92.wav_ASR	you have an vacation
71-2_4670.828_2.306.wav_ASR	and so i told firstnamet give you last year
71-2_4673.345_2.38.wav_ASR	but i don't have a lot of control over it
71-2_4676.085_0.796.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
71-2_4677.505_0.76.wav_ASR	that was nice
71-2_4683.67_0.73.wav_ASR	okay
71-2_4684.79_1.88.wav_ASR	we've already talked about my age
71-2_4687.29_1.19.wav_ASR	so i'll come up with the different ones
71-2_4688.98_22.04.wav_ASR	well i useta have this thing that i would do to family members and friends which involved them in restaurant management at a restaurant
71-2_4711.28_5.98.wav_ASR	and what i would do is i would usually go to work
71-2_4718.12_0.593.wav_ASR	how do i get out
71-2_4718.88_1.542.wav_ASR	and i would assume myself in the morning
71-2_4720.7_0.485.wav_ASR	and i would go
71-2_4721.32_1.92.wav_ASR	and i would talk to a waitress
71-2_4723.38_1.18.wav_ASR	and i would say something else
71-2_4724.78_0.758.wav_ASR	is it my cousin
71-2_4725.64_1.14.wav_ASR	it's his birthday today
71-2_4727.48_2.1.wav_ASR	he doesn't like anything electronic
71-2_4729.698_4.925.wav_ASR	and so is there any point in time in which you can bring us a child
71-2_4734.623_3.695.wav_ASR	and then we could really appreciate him by singing really loudly and all that
71-2_4738.31_3.62.wav_ASR	and usually the waitress stayed with me
71-2_4742.318_0.971.wav_ASR	we didn't love to do it
71-2_4743.298_0.762.wav_ASR	that would be fine
71-2_4744.738_1.792.wav_ASR	so i had this thing about doing it
71-2_4746.63_5.9.wav_ASR	and very often i would bring my own candles the kind that you can smell
71-2_4752.99_5.848.wav_ASR	they they react because then you can really see what's going on
71-2_4758.97_1.497.wav_ASR	yeah that was nice
71-2_4761.43_2.915.wav_ASR	so it was my cousin's wife
71-2_4764.86_4.14.wav_ASR	and his relationship with his girl friend is very good
71-2_4769.48_3.76.wav_ASR	and he's always kind of quiet and reserved
71-2_4774.06_7.648.wav_ASR	so i decided that what we should really do is we should call a lot of attention to him because he's a good kid
71-2_4782.483_4.66.wav_ASR	so there were about fifty of us there that night
71-2_4787.403_2.28.wav_ASR	we weren't all sitting in the same place
71-2_4790.743_1.267.wav_ASR	we were in the same building
71-2_4792.783_6.78.wav_ASR	well i decided that would actually aid to the event if we had people singing from a dance or something
71-2_4800.425_7.26.wav_ASR	well i i took my niece and nephew with me to talk to the people
71-2_4808.085_1.875.wav_ASR	and firstnamem was then six
71-2_4810.545_1.415.wav_ASR	and firstnamee was eighteen
71-2_4812.62_1.14.wav_ASR	so they came with me
71-2_4813.825_0.36.wav_ASR	and i said
71-2_4814.405_1.486.wav_ASR	that's what we're gonna do to die
71-2_4815.905_1.236.wav_ASR	we're gonna go home
71-2_4817.285_1.99.wav_ASR	we're going to surprise him on my birthday
71-2_4819.275_11.285.wav_ASR	so what we hafta do is is we hafta make sure that everybody understands that they're gonna hafta sing at some point in time
71-2_4831.135_4.64.wav_ASR	so firstnamed is over talking to i don't know so many people
71-2_4836.42_3.78.wav_ASR	and firstnamem and firstnamee and i are running around trying to help
71-2_4840.48_2.887.wav_ASR	okay now you hafta sing very good
71-2_4843.64_1.672.wav_ASR	you gotta be very very good
71-2_4845.6_1.096.wav_ASR	yes
71-2_4847.02_9.14.wav_ASR	so he hears firstnamem talking to the i think it was probably firstnamep
71-2_4856.255_2.8.wav_ASR	now remember to sing very very good
71-2_4859.535_1.02.wav_ASR	the hospital
71-2_4861.135_1.305.wav_ASR	and i'm enjoying this whole process
71-2_4864.14_0.78.wav_ASR	and i was just like

71-2_4869.355_1.262.wav_ASR	he knew something was wrong
71-2_4871.42_5.18.wav_ASR	but he didn't know about the topic that i was working on
71-2_4876.94_5.5.wav_ASR	didn't know about the supplement that wouldn't burn a hole in my stomach
71-2_4882.7_11.06.wav_ASR	he didn't know that we're gonna get the the internet website westminster stafaross
71-2_4894.34_6.12.wav_ASR	and he didn't know that everybody in my family would really enjoy the invitation party
71-2_4900.46_6.912.wav_ASR	and you know we get very kind of when we're together
71-2_4907.74_2.645.wav_ASR	yeah of course they came from there
71-2_4910.64_5.579.wav_ASR	and i only thought one food server was going to be there
71-2_4917.02_1.8.wav_ASR	and then we had six children
71-2_4919.0_1.337.wav_ASR	everybody invited to come

71-2_4924.697_6.411.wav_ASR	he could tell that it was coming because everybody at the other side are ringing and everything
71-2_4931.777_2.24.wav_ASR	and firstnamem and firstnamee are just lovely
71-2_4934.457_1.743.wav_ASR	really knocking around in the house

71-2_4943.099_1.014.wav_ASR	you roll it up
71-2_4944.419_1.009.wav_ASR	came back up again
71-2_4945.559_0.321.wav_ASR	and i says
71-2_4946.139_1.029.wav_ASR	you must be getting older
71-2_4947.999_3.841.wav_ASR	do you at least have the ability to blow it up
71-2_4951.84_1.08.wav_ASR	well can you please do this
71-2_4953.279_0.841.wav_ASR	and then i thought
71-2_4955.019_0.65.wav_ASR	the money
71-2_4955.879_0.703.wav_ASR	what's going on
71-2_4956.739_1.861.wav_ASR	and he's looking at me
71-2_4958.6_2.165.wav_ASR	and he got down and he said
71-2_4961.02_4.396.wav_ASR	you know firstnamep i don't know
71-2_4965.96_1.081.wav_ASR	well i'm gonna remember that
71-2_4967.18_0.36.wav_ASR	and i said
71-2_4967.76_1.097.wav_ASR	was it a surprise
71-2_4968.88_0.538.wav_ASR	yes he said
71-2_4969.54_2.689.wav_ASR	it was not a surprise when i heard firstnamem
71-2_4972.7_2.78.wav_ASR	remember to sing very very good
71-2_4976.56_11.193.wav_ASR	so i'll say that i i you know i i think i handed the waitress i think i gave her twenty dollars or something what i was going to pay
71-2_4988.7_0.52.wav_ASR	what's your name
71-2_4989.46_1.132.wav_ASR	it was so much pain
71-2_4990.7_0.32.wav_ASR	and she says
71-2_4991.1_1.881.wav_ASR	well generally it's a little much
71-2_4992.981_3.44.wav_ASR	and she just looked at me and said
71-2_4998.102_3.085.wav_ASR	well alright anyway
71-2_5001.681_0.427.wav_ASR	that is it
71-2_5016.87_9.94.wav_ASR	back in the days when i would make peanut butter and jelly sandwich because of course i can't have peanut butter and jelly
71-2_5026.95_5.193.wav_ASR	the surgery fatigued and too much sugar in the blood
71-2_5032.23_5.632.wav_ASR	but back in the days when i would've done this what i would've done is i would've said
71-2_5038.61_13.295.wav_ASR	and i would've toasted it because the texture of toast works better for me than it does with unsweetened bread
71-2_5052.65_3.64.wav_ASR	so i would begin by putting it in the bread
71-2_5056.23_6.16.wav_ASR	and while it's tossing up i would pull out the peanut butter and jelly
71-2_5063.89_6.546.wav_ASR	when the bread comes out of the toaster i would begin with the peanut butter
71-2_5070.71_0.899.wav_ASR	that goes on the bike
71-2_5071.89_4.232.wav_ASR	but i would do with a knife is i would pull out some jelly
71-2_5076.47_2.8.wav_ASR	and i would spread it evenly on the bread
71-2_5079.93_2.64.wav_ASR	then i would take the other piece of bread
71-2_5083.17_7.54.wav_ASR	and i would take a spoon and spoon out of the jar
71-2_5091.25_1.174.wav_ASR	write it around evenly
71-2_5093.29_1.54.wav_ASR	and then put the two of them together
71-2_5095.33_3.74.wav_ASR	and probably slice it between the two
71-2_5100.37_1.46.wav_ASR	and i don't think like that at all
71-2_5102.25_1.58.wav_ASR	and if i did that's how i would do it
71-2_5111.35_0.5.wav_ASR	uhhuh
71-2_5112.173_4.003.wav_ASR	well i think we talked about it a lot
71-2_5116.353_4.662.wav_ASR	well i'm not doing my laundry since last week which means i really need to do it
71-2_5122.17_24.64.wav_ASR	when i do laundry what i'm able to do is not separate them separate them from color and white because i've gotten to the point that i'll always be washed in the same colors
71-2_5147.64_14.38.wav_ASR	so all of my middle labor is already put aside because as close to fall the sun is going to set
71-2_5163.84_1.68.wav_ASR	so when it's time to do laundry
71-2_5205.68_2.96.wav_ASR	my plan is probably too much to say
71-2_5208.96_5.54.wav_ASR	have a break between two different appointments that will allow me to go to work
71-2_5214.8_4.46.wav_ASR	when i'm going to do as i pull into the laundry which is a lot of work
71-2_5221.0_3.28.wav_ASR	well i think it's about twenty one hundred percent
71-2_5224.612_5.38.wav_ASR	well i will walk into a meeting size group of people
71-2_5230.452_2.529.wav_ASR	all of my laundry
71-2_5233.212_2.606.wav_ASR	well not separate it by color or anything
71-2_5236.572_4.435.wav_ASR	and i will then add the soup at the top of the sandwich
71-2_5241.89_6.96.wav_ASR	then i will put in enough carrots to be able to eat it
71-2_5249.67_3.44.wav_ASR	and i will wash on my clothes on
71-2_5253.83_7.3.wav_ASR	after the covers are in i put the collar back on
71-2_5261.412_5.86.wav_ASR	and then i take note of the fact that it will take twenty five minutes for me to get there
71-2_5300.51_7.94.wav_ASR	because it's towels and sweats and things and sweatshirts that i can wear
71-2_5309.73_7.36.wav_ASR	and then i threw it all back in the hamper and take it home and then sometimes under the bed
71-2_5317.17_8.72.wav_ASR	and sometimes i just take right out of the clean hamper and put it on my my my bed or whatever
71-2_5335.726_1.6.wav_ASR	can i go
71-2_5338.086_0.904.wav_ASR	well i've never done that
71-2_5339.206_1.26.wav_ASR	and i have tried
71-2_5341.05_1.916.wav_ASR	we'll make very clear that i have trouble
71-2_5343.826_8.14.wav_ASR	and have not ever succeeded in doing so much
71-2_5352.99_2.016.wav_ASR	if i wanted to do it cut it up
71-2_5355.43_3.92.wav_ASR	and this is what it says on the slipper
71-2_5360.33_1.64.wav_ASR	oh which has never worked for me
71-2_5362.41_2.88.wav_ASR	well this is essentially the way that i do it
71-2_5365.51_1.04.wav_ASR	and i would get
71-2_5368.81_1.36.wav_ASR	or i would've gone
71-2_5370.83_2.38.wav_ASR	and i would go to a plant
71-2_5374.88_3.677.wav_ASR	and there is one that's about a mile and half away from my house
71-2_5378.64_3.28.wav_ASR	and you buy a special type of
71-2_5384.1_1.523.wav_ASR	it it comes in a bag
71-2_5385.8_1.105.wav_ASR	and i think it's it's
71-2_5387.32_6.933.wav_ASR	well i know it's it's further than that you should be able to speak with me
71-2_5394.253_3.88.wav_ASR	and i would put this into a jar
71-2_5398.493_12.547.wav_ASR	well i would make sure that there was a hole in it for leaving so that if you put the water in the water it'll be easier to drain it out
71-2_5412.06_6.94.wav_ASR	put the pot near a window so that he can hear it
71-2_5420.54_3.72.wav_ASR	and what i would do is make sure it's
71-2_5424.56_4.012.wav_ASR	the first i would read the documents on the cpc page which is a lot of work
71-2_5429.36_2.358.wav_ASR	you hafta go down about two weeks
71-2_5431.718_2.05.wav_ASR	you take a slice
71-2_5434.438_1.243.wav_ASR	you place it
71-2_5436.118_0.689.wav_ASR	you cut it up
71-2_5437.218_1.782.wav_ASR	you water it
71-2_5439.278_1.558.wav_ASR	and then you leave it alone
71-2_5441.258_2.82.wav_ASR	and most of the nurses take it's very good
71-2_5444.438_5.88.wav_ASR	in my particular situation one time i had a stroke
71-2_5451.69_10.26.wav_ASR	another time i simply ordered it to the point that the soil was so saturated that i couldn't walk
71-2_5463.05_8.069.wav_ASR	and i think the other time it just was too cold in my apartment to be able to spritz myself
71-2_5471.119_2.542.wav_ASR	but i've seen other people do it
71-2_5473.819_1.78.wav_ASR	my know the process is
71-2_5475.839_4.031.wav_ASR	well i've just been unable to do it in a way that makes it feel good
71-2_5480.75_10.703.wav_ASR	so yeah i'm still in the political state of denver pennsylvania
71-2_5491.453_11.589.wav_ASR	but i haven't yet figured out how to keep the soil dry enough so that it can sprout without water
71-2_5503.85_5.443.wav_ASR	so i think there's a balance i haven't agreed to be able to do that
84-1_17.07_2.48.wav_ASR	and i would hafta say one of my favorite things
84-1_19.816_4.091.wav_ASR	my wife and i have two sons that are older than me
84-1_24.096_5.94.wav_ASR	and for a number of years we went skiing in utah
84-1_31.276_2.24.wav_ASR	and i really enjoyed the outdoors
84-1_33.838_6.2.wav_ASR	so my younger was probably about three years old and my oldest was in college
84-1_40.738_1.181.wav_ASR	well it's probably a little less
84-1_42.198_2.46.wav_ASR	five and one
84-1_45.878_4.42.wav_ASR	and i was just so much fun to get out there and and
84-1_50.529_3.88.wav_ASR	but i i could see already but my but my daughter
84-1_55.149_1.45.wav_ASR	my wife sleep a little bit
84-1_56.809_3.24.wav_ASR	my two kids became pretty good with me
84-1_60.329_3.354.wav_ASR	and i am pretty sure that a lot of it is
84-1_63.693_8.407.wav_ASR	we had a guy when we were in in
84-1_72.333_1.915.wav_ASR	just lost the name of it
84-1_74.633_3.58.wav_ASR	and when we were there
84-1_78.653_2.88.wav_ASR	and we were gone with him for a number of years
84-1_81.538_1.66.wav_ASR	he did a really good job
84-1_83.198_9.633.wav_ASR	well i hope that will give you a little bit of sense of how much i enjoy my kids and number two how much i enjoyed the first one
84-1_100.218_1.397.wav_ASR	it it was very nice
84-1_127.149_12.52.wav_ASR	well i just got excited to be part of the band again because i was a drummer
84-1_141.089_3.08.wav_ASR	and i would say my my speech
84-1_144.711_5.549.wav_ASR	and i i think my skills are pretty good
84-1_150.311_2.822.wav_ASR	they're never gonna be great as they once were
84-1_153.811_8.199.wav_ASR	so i would say on a scale of one to ten right now i have a score of nine
84-1_162.21_3.04.wav_ASR	so i feel like i made a lot of progress
84-1_165.81_5.761.wav_ASR	but i know that there's more progress i needta make especially with my stroke
84-1_172.07_1.91.wav_ASR	big words can be difficult for me
84-1_174.17_3.53.wav_ASR	so i do see a speech therapist once a week
84-1_177.77_3.733.wav_ASR	and she's been extremely extremely happy
84-1_181.503_0.887.wav_ASR	and i like her a lot
84-1_182.39_6.734.wav_ASR	and i also have somebody do some some work for me
84-1_189.203_1.429.wav_ASR	the two of them are just great
84-1_196.9_1.27.wav_ASR	oh i remember that pretty well
84-1_207.12_2.95.wav_ASR	well my wife was away for a week
84-1_210.39_2.78.wav_ASR	we had a house in alexandria
84-1_214.15_3.64.wav_ASR	and i remember that weekend because i had two children
84-1_217.968_4.82.wav_ASR	and i thought the biggest thing we i could do for the weekend was to go out
84-1_223.738_8.03.wav_ASR	so i think she probably went down there on may first
84-1_232.508_2.66.wav_ASR	and i came home from work on monday
84-1_236.128_0.848.wav_ASR	and i had dinner
84-1_236.976_0.998.wav_ASR	and i did some more
84-1_238.176_2.0.wav_ASR	well i get up the next morning
84-1_240.536_5.24.wav_ASR	well that was the thirtieth thirty first of january
84-1_247.676_1.721.wav_ASR	and i felt pretty good
84-1_249.716_1.188.wav_ASR	and i went about my day
84-1_251.576_2.08.wav_ASR	and i went out for a bicycle ride
84-1_254.296_1.0.wav_ASR	and i came home
84-1_255.22_20.6.wav_ASR	and that night it was i think like a week or maybe after florida was killed by the hurricane
84-1_276.504_5.66.wav_ASR	and so on saturday night i went to bed a little early
84-1_282.524_4.46.wav_ASR	well i i thought there might be something wrong
84-1_287.724_3.66.wav_ASR	and i also thought it would be helpful in my life
84-1_291.464_1.784.wav_ASR	so i could clean up a little bit
84-1_293.7_2.69.wav_ASR	so we live in a fairly nice area
84-1_297.14_2.43.wav_ASR	and i went to bed around ten o'clock
84-1_300.6_5.7.wav_ASR	and that night saturday night there was a lot of violence in in sinai
84-1_307.16_3.84.wav_ASR	and i remember that that a building was there
84-1_315.929_2.242.wav_ASR	and so i thought
84-1_318.529_2.98.wav_ASR	well i i live in a fairly secure area
84-1_322.129_4.884.wav_ASR	and the next morning i got up really early and went to work
84-1_327.229_1.08.wav_ASR	it was a total mess
84-1_329.189_1.324.wav_ASR	so i started cleaning up
84-1_331.129_3.4.wav_ASR	and sometime during the day i felt a little bit better
84-1_334.969_1.819.wav_ASR	so i went back home
84-1_337.0_1.019.wav_ASR	and i rested for a long time
84-1_338.309_1.26.wav_ASR	and i went out and got a paper
84-1_340.069_2.184.wav_ASR	and then i felt pretty good for the rest of the time
84-1_342.769_10.717.wav_ASR	and sometime on this sunday night before midnight thirty first and eighth i mean and january first
84-1_354.11_3.04.wav_ASR	and in the morning my wife could not get out of bed
84-1_357.75_1.397.wav_ASR	so we have a daughter
84-1_359.39_0.831.wav_ASR	and he went up
84-1_360.85_1.3.wav_ASR	and i was on the floor
84-1_362.37_2.0.wav_ASR	and so he called an ambulance
84-1_364.67_4.58.wav_ASR	my wife was in arizona
84-1_369.477_7.22.wav_ASR	so she was told that i had better that i
84-1_377.397_1.08.wav_ASR	and i'm bad with the pronunciation
84-1_378.897_3.68.wav_ASR	that my wife should have told me
84-1_382.428_8.24.wav_ASR	and i have two sons one who's in new york and the other is in chicago
84-1_391.348_6.86.wav_ASR	and they were told it was probably a good idea for them to come home because i wasn't sure what was going on
84-1_398.267_6.5.wav_ASR	and so i remember distinctly that i was brought into the emergency room
84-1_405.227_2.72.wav_ASR	and apparently i i could not say anything
84-1_407.987_2.86.wav_ASR	my my voice was very good
84-1_411.47_14.3.wav_ASR	but by the end of the procedure my my wife told me later that she thought i wasn't going to make it
84-1_425.77_14.463.wav_ASR	but by the end of the surgery i was able she thought the surgery was good enough
84-1_440.31_3.579.wav_ASR	they didn't know how much exactly i'll be able to do
84-1_444.38_6.0.wav_ASR	so i spent about six eight weeks in the hospital
84-1_451.21_2.29.wav_ASR	and i came out not sure what happened
84-1_453.84_4.18.wav_ASR	so today i i feel pretty good about myself
84-1_458.6_2.9.wav_ASR	because i said i still feel like there's more to learn
84-1_462.06_4.25.wav_ASR	so as i said i think i'm about seventy percent of the way there
84-1_478.63_9.28.wav_ASR	well i was in rehab for eight weeks about a place that's about ten miles away
84-1_488.29_1.76.wav_ASR	and it was a time when it was called
84-1_490.47_3.04.wav_ASR	so it wasn't really easy for me to speak at all
84-1_494.13_3.84.wav_ASR	but one of the people where we live
84-1_498.084_2.28.wav_ASR	because i live in a high story building
84-1_501.2_9.29.wav_ASR	one of the persons was maybe the second or third commandant which is where i went to school
84-1_511.17_8.41.wav_ASR	and this person whose name is firstnamet was allowed to get a new job
84-1_520.09_3.903.wav_ASR	well i i got to see well my two sisters with me
84-1_524.19_2.789.wav_ASR	and my my children came with me
84-1_527.21_2.02.wav_ASR	and then my wife came in
84-1_529.33_4.5.wav_ASR	so i had a very good life
84-1_534.47_8.45.wav_ASR	and so each day i would have o t and p t
84-1_543.73_2.66.wav_ASR	well that was every day except for saturday and sunday
84-1_554.07_3.15.wav_ASR	well what can i say about it
84-1_558.98_2.94.wav_ASR	so i i mean i understood i hadta deal with it
84-1_562.65_2.916.wav_ASR	and you know always deal with it but i tried to
84-1_590.17_3.99.wav_ASR	well i hafta tell you i've had a pretty good life until now
84-1_595.73_3.421.wav_ASR	well i would say that one of the best things that ever happened to me is
84-1_599.151_7.46.wav_ASR	and i was in a program at a school called firstnamew which is very good
84-1_607.212_12.7.wav_ASR	and when i was there part of this this program i was in this conversation reminded me made it so much easier
84-1_620.93_9.96.wav_ASR	and doing starting in seventieth grade through high school and then into college i spoke french fluently
84-1_631.61_7.66.wav_ASR	because i had a teacher in in firstnamew who was at the time going out with one of her students
84-1_639.596_3.36.wav_ASR	and so she was going
84-1_643.098_1.783.wav_ASR	and she useta talk about that all the time
84-1_645.456_2.323.wav_ASR	and so i took a class from her
84-1_648.376_1.811.wav_ASR	and somehow i did pretty well
84-1_650.376_6.36.wav_ASR	so when i was in the program at
84-1_657.064_3.6.wav_ASR	and i would say one of the happiest occasions for me was my wedding
84-1_661.59_8.094.wav_ASR	and i i wound up doing pretty well at the school and even though i had gone to college
84-1_670.684_1.52.wav_ASR	and it was really exciting
84-1_672.25_9.12.wav_ASR	and i i i knew a bunch of people in my class but i was really close with the class before the stroke
84-1_681.67_2.875.wav_ASR	and it was just a fun time for me
84-1_684.545_1.765.wav_ASR	well i was presented to my future father
84-1_687.01_6.06.wav_ASR	and i i met someone who became my best friend
84-1_693.27_2.1.wav_ASR	he was the president at one time
84-1_695.55_2.306.wav_ASR	so i it was really good
84-1_698.38_8.68.wav_ASR	after i graduated from high school i spent some vacation with my parents
84-1_707.68_2.16.wav_ASR	he he was someone who was really wet
84-1_710.58_2.476.wav_ASR	he went to harvard law school
84-1_713.273_5.48.wav_ASR	and at the end of his freshman year he went out he one the movie and everything
84-1_719.733_2.72.wav_ASR	and he went down to the bottom
84-1_722.973_3.56.wav_ASR	and he bought all books about adult reading and everything
84-1_726.863_7.22.wav_ASR	and so he went back to go to firstnamec's house
84-1_734.443_1.76.wav_ASR	he was already in los angeles
84-1_736.563_2.08.wav_ASR	he had been under guard at the prison
84-1_739.263_4.24.wav_ASR	and he and he after his first year of being the movie critic
84-1_743.663_0.992.wav_ASR	it wasn't for me
84-1_744.8_5.82.wav_ASR	and he went to a program he went to a a program in atlanta georgia
84-1_756.57_3.48.wav_ASR	yeah i i was really it was a good time
84-1_764.754_4.32.wav_ASR	and i haven't been visiting since the stroke
84-1_769.655_5.279.wav_ASR	but i useta be fairly involved in the church
84-1_775.834_6.1.wav_ASR	and my youngest son went there after spending a few days there
84-1_782.807_7.94.wav_ASR	and he really really did a lot of work for me
84-1_790.907_3.04.wav_ASR	so i was very excited for her
84-1_828.61_2.67.wav_ASR	well i happen to know these pictures quite well
84-1_832.07_3.18.wav_ASR	it's a story about a kid playing soccer
84-1_836.05_3.3.wav_ASR	and he he strikes the window
84-1_839.99_3.52.wav_ASR	and went through the window of a neighbor's house
84-1_843.796_24.848.wav_ASR	and landed inside the house where it was taken by one of the young or middle age person
84-1_868.644_20.254.wav_ASR	and then he looked out the window to see if he could figure out who may have hit hit the soccer ball so that landed it on his not his lap but on his house
84-1_907.89_1.94.wav_ASR	the this one i already know
84-1_909.988_8.342.wav_ASR	it's about a young boy who when he went to school he was denied whether or not he could go
84-1_918.59_2.6.wav_ASR	he decided not to take the umbrella
84-1_921.69_2.48.wav_ASR	and it turned out that it it started to rain
84-1_924.87_1.88.wav_ASR	so he went back home
84-1_926.94_1.818.wav_ASR	and he was soaking wet
84-1_929.34_2.127.wav_ASR	but apparently he changed his course
84-1_932.02_5.76.wav_ASR	and he went back outside with a umbrella so that he could go to school again
84-1_938.24_6.041.wav_ASR	well i assume he went to school on time but i really don't know whether that's positive or negative
84-1_957.58_7.15.wav_ASR	so this is a little girl maybe under ten who had a cat who was stuck in the tree
84-1_965.45_7.58.wav_ASR	so apparently the the dad got off his bike
84-1_973.283_3.967.wav_ASR	the girl was unhappy
84-1_977.59_1.904.wav_ASR	and he stopped and looked at the cat
84-1_979.94_19.956.wav_ASR	so the the the the the the cat went up to get the the the the the the the ladder fell down
84-1_999.896_13.754.wav_ASR	and i guess the the ladder got kicked away so that the husband was stuck there in the tree
84-1_1014.556_2.6.wav_ASR	and the the dog started barking
84-1_1017.78_2.68.wav_ASR	and eventually the fire department came
84-1_1021.24_0.94.wav_ASR	and they were eating
84-1_1022.44_0.5.wav_ASR	presidential
84-1_1023.32_0.654.wav_ASR	don't know
84-1_1024.06_3.563.wav_ASR	well i think they were able to get the cat and get the man down
84-1_1188.54_7.06.wav_ASR	so this is a story about a a young woman and her father
84-1_1196.189_19.982.wav_ASR	and she was working at a place where there was a middle age lady and two people who had grown up with her and was interested in cinderella
84-1_1216.59_15.38.wav_ASR	so it turned out that the that the that was a young prince who was interested in cinderella
84-1_1232.85_29.52.wav_ASR	and the young prince decided that they should get together and have a ball so that anybody if the people of the kingdom could find out if anyone was there
84-1_1263.48_2.52.wav_ASR	well i don't remember the name of the person
84-1_1266.09_4.89.wav_ASR	but so they send her out an invitation to all the people in the kingdom
84-1_1272.04_9.98.wav_ASR	and the two young ladies who lived with her were
84-1_1284.38_8.84.wav_ASR	her older mother decided that they would go to the ball and started going to the ball
84-1_1293.98_17.52.wav_ASR	but cinderella who was like a careaker on the property and was stuck doing things like washing clothes and cleaning the floor and stuff like that she found out about the opportunity to go to the ball
84-1_1312.413_4.54.wav_ASR	and she wanted to know if there was some way she could go
84-1_1317.593_1.78.wav_ASR	so she said
84-1_1320.333_2.28.wav_ASR	don't remember exactly how it happened
84-1_1323.133_6.02.wav_ASR	and she was able to get into touch with somebody i think they called the fire department
84-1_1330.065_3.52.wav_ASR	and she talked to the fairy godmother
84-1_1334.45_20.985.wav_ASR	and so while the two people from the from the house were going with her her her older lady lady to the dance at the ball
84-1_1355.435_4.2.wav_ASR	so she got dressed up and in fancy clothes
84-1_1360.415_5.337.wav_ASR	and she was told by the fairy godmother that she could go to the ball
84-1_1365.795_1.72.wav_ASR	but she had only one reason
84-1_1368.295_2.94.wav_ASR	and that is that she be be back by midnight
84-1_1371.407_11.811.wav_ASR	so she went to the ball and fell in love with the prince with the prince and was happy ever after
84-1_1383.218_12.28.wav_ASR	but when the clock struck twelve midnight cinderella knew she hadta go away
84-1_1396.098_5.08.wav_ASR	so she raised for the door and down the steps and went home
84-1_1401.35_2.26.wav_ASR	but soon the carriage came
84-1_1404.69_9.9.wav_ASR	and she was by herself with i think some young people who may have been ragamuffin and other members of the group
84-1_1415.23_19.09.wav_ASR	so she she found out that the young princess was looking for the the young lady who had decided to marry a prince
84-1_1434.84_11.51.wav_ASR	and he sent out a a i guess some sort of plea or something that if the person was around she could go to the dance
84-1_1446.76_12.16.wav_ASR	and when that didn't happen then a young man went around the village to see if by chance anybody knew anybody who could fit the slipper
84-1_1459.92_3.1.wav_ASR	and when she went to the house that had the
84-1_1463.595_2.1.wav_ASR	well i guess you might by now call them suicide
84-1_1468.04_9.89.wav_ASR	well i think somebody got a hole of cinderella who may be washing clothes or something like that
84-1_1478.88_7.897.wav_ASR	and when she was brought upstairs the one shoe that had been left behind she tried it on
84-1_1486.777_13.623.wav_ASR	and it fit her so that she knew that the the young prince was going to find cinderella
84-1_1501.077_2.06.wav_ASR	and so i guess they got back to school
84-1_1503.537_1.94.wav_ASR	originally they got married
84-1_1550.75_3.76.wav_ASR	never really had a lot of information about it
84-1_1555.47_3.2.wav_ASR	and i was pretty much on my own
84-1_1559.37_10.68.wav_ASR	and when i was in high school there for some reason was no real time limit at the beginning
84-1_1570.61_8.74.wav_ASR	so you know i went to a lot of parties on friday night and Saturday night and going to the dance
84-1_1579.38_20.6.wav_ASR	and i think it was an important part because my two older people decided that you know he that the two of them really hadta teach me how to be comfortable with myself and not having to do a lot of work
84-1_1600.084_3.495.wav_ASR	so i mean there were five times when i was in the hospital
84-1_1604.124_2.309.wav_ASR	but nothing really ever happened to me
84-1_1606.924_3.866.wav_ASR	and then when i went to college i would come home during the day
84-1_1611.804_6.56.wav_ASR	and i remember that i was involved with a group of people
84-1_1618.528_4.623.wav_ASR	but i would go out with them but i could get home whenever i wanted to
84-1_1623.52_6.58.wav_ASR	and i remember one summer i had a job that required me to be in a work environment
84-1_1630.928_3.42.wav_ASR	so sometimes during the summer i would stay at home and then go to school
84-1_1645.61_7.485.wav_ASR	well so i worked a lot particularly when i had the stroke
84-1_1653.47_2.186.wav_ASR	think i may have told you that
84-1_1655.73_0.463.wav_ASR	and i thought
84-1_1656.193_3.42.wav_ASR	but i worked for a french company for two years
84-1_1660.878_8.049.wav_ASR	and i when i had my stroke i started thinking about what was going on
84-1_1668.927_8.2.wav_ASR	because really between vacations and between a lot of time i spent participating in things
84-1_1678.067_2.92.wav_ASR	they were in a town in new jersey called morristown
84-1_1681.727_2.08.wav_ASR	and they both played a lot of hockey
84-1_1684.367_2.89.wav_ASR	so i never really had a lot of time
84-1_1687.246_2.783.wav_ASR	but one thing i've decided i'm going to do
84-1_1690.506_4.76.wav_ASR	with in the past year we're gonna be moving a little bit more
84-1_1695.886_3.08.wav_ASR	and i really thought that one thing i could do was write
84-1_1699.586_2.933.wav_ASR	because i've always had an interest in it
84-1_1702.606_1.984.wav_ASR	but i've never really focused on it
84-1_1705.086_1.62.wav_ASR	and i really thought particularly
84-1_1706.856_2.9.wav_ASR	now i ride a three wheel bike
84-1_1709.936_4.506.wav_ASR	well i can't ride a a two wheel bicycle like i used to
84-1_1714.521_16.081.wav_ASR	so i'm really hoping that we move i can learn about birds and maybe become someone of an interest in in bird watching because i have a lot of experience with it
84-1_1736.76_2.52.wav_ASR	oh so did she live in baltimore
84-1_1760.0_20.64.wav_ASR	well i i guess when i started traveling for this french company when i was many years ago
84-1_1780.938_3.5.wav_ASR	but they quickly figured out that i couldn't talk
84-1_1785.098_1.94.wav_ASR	so the girls were in front
84-1_1787.898_2.948.wav_ASR	and i was one of the few older girls outside of school
84-1_1791.078_1.06.wav_ASR	and i was in the united states
84-1_1793.658_4.48.wav_ASR	well they useta send me to virginia
84-1_1798.398_5.96.wav_ASR	and i remember that i stayed in a real nice hotel at the time
84-1_1805.978_2.42.wav_ASR	and i also stayed in a nice hotel
84-1_1809.158_3.84.wav_ASR	and i was in a nice hotel when i went there
84-1_1813.177_5.8.wav_ASR	and i also was in a nice hotel when i was in new york
84-1_1822.457_6.54.wav_ASR	so i and during one of the times i was there in the hospital
84-1_1829.537_3.16.wav_ASR	so i remember that the stuff brought me a little better
84-1_1833.15_7.12.wav_ASR	so i i i i don't really need a big hotel or anything like that
84-1_1841.05_10.3.wav_ASR	oh i i always thought i was in places that i could be comfortable even when i was a child
84-1_1851.626_2.28.wav_ASR	you know i i do remember saying it one time
84-1_1854.01_5.896.wav_ASR	and i was in baltimore for a to be part of a group of people with aphasia
84-1_1860.446_2.235.wav_ASR	and we stayed in a god hotel
84-1_1862.726_3.066.wav_ASR	even though even that turned out to be a good thing
84-1_1865.941_11.7.wav_ASR	so it was a good way for me to learn about the way different hotels and things like that
84-1_1878.421_3.38.wav_ASR	well i was in a hotel in a bad part of town with my wife
84-1_1882.0_1.381.wav_ASR	remember that pretty well
84-1_1897.088_7.408.wav_ASR	well when i was in college there was a girl
84-1_1904.816_0.654.wav_ASR	okay i told you
84-1_1905.47_0.58.wav_ASR	the protein
84-1_1906.59_6.9.wav_ASR	and over the key he was there for about about thirty seven days
84-1_1913.91_2.92.wav_ASR	and in nineteen ninety nine he got married
84-1_1917.85_5.54.wav_ASR	but before that time she and the prince
84-1_1923.607_16.1.wav_ASR	there was one person from the class of sixty five a couple of people from the class of seventy five which was me and firstnamel
84-1_1939.914_5.6.wav_ASR	the three of us the six five of us became very good friends
84-1_1945.874_9.776.wav_ASR	and every year because she did not really have anything to wear
84-1_1955.75_8.1.wav_ASR	he had a child who died when when he was i think maybe six months old
84-1_1964.11_8.96.wav_ASR	and and so one thing he useta do one a quarter from kentucky he goes to school
84-1_1973.501_5.94.wav_ASR	and we stayed in a hotel
84-1_1979.861_3.68.wav_ASR	for every year after for about twenty five years
84-1_1983.921_5.12.wav_ASR	when i went to a place that's no longer in existence but it was
84-1_1989.678_3.6.wav_ASR	and it was a very nice place
84-1_1994.718_3.712.wav_ASR	and we just had a wonderful time every year ever since
84-1_1998.43_14.51.wav_ASR	so i really think back on that one a lot and remember just how much fun i had with these people and how much i loved them
84-1_2012.94_5.74.wav_ASR	and so these these people are some very long ago
84-1_2019.2_6.8.wav_ASR	and the so i've always had one of the wives as a friend
84-1_2026.88_4.22.wav_ASR	he was the head of this thing called the
84-1_2031.651_17.0.wav_ASR	it's a big thing
84-1_2048.851_0.828.wav_ASR	for forgot the name
84-1_2049.811_1.4.wav_ASR	they have a huge truck
84-1_2051.568_3.28.wav_ASR	and so he's gonna retire and move back to florida
84-1_2055.648_10.086.wav_ASR	so i'm very excited that at the end of september i'm going to be meeting with them and and this people who will help me
84-1_2066.128_2.086.wav_ASR	so i'm looking forward to it
84-1_2068.397_8.98.wav_ASR	every day i i some days i would be in a little better than i was
84-1_2077.677_3.26.wav_ASR	they all know i had a stroke
84-1_2081.677_3.36.wav_ASR	but i i'm really looking forward to it
84-1_2085.17_5.06.wav_ASR	most days i think that maybe i should go because i'm not getting better
84-1_2090.73_1.56.wav_ASR	but it's it
84-1_2093.19_1.8.wav_ASR	can't remember what we were talking about
84-1_2100.86_4.44.wav_ASR	so so we went to this very nice place
84-1_2105.464_2.296.wav_ASR	we did it for about twenty or twenty five years
84-1_2108.22_5.907.wav_ASR	and it was a good place for me and for the other people that were in the thing
84-1_2114.08_11.39.wav_ASR	we useta do it every year in december because it was near the time when one of our favorite people from work came to visit us
84-1_2132.16_4.04.wav_ASR	it was a french restaurant all alone
84-1_2137.66_14.62.wav_ASR	well it's if you go back to the nineties seventies and eighties it's a two fifty nine westminster one fifty nine
84-1_2152.28_7.02.wav_ASR	you know it's in a nice old building that has a lot of people around
84-1_2159.56_1.7.wav_ASR	and it was excellent
84-1_2161.495_22.32.wav_ASR	and because while we came in for the year they knew he knew the stepdaughters really really well so that when we came in i felt like a part of the family
84-1_2184.085_1.14.wav_ASR	it was really nice
84-1_2189.53_1.988.wav_ASR	it's not there anymore
84-1_2191.525_0.84.wav_ASR	it was so
84-1_2192.725_1.984.wav_ASR	there was an owner and his wife
84-1_2195.385_3.86.wav_ASR	and i think they eventually you know said
84-1_2199.985_8.94.wav_ASR	and they sold the restaurant to a guy who was i think from either fast food or something
84-1_2210.365_2.624.wav_ASR	and he did not do a very good job
84-1_2212.939_7.3.wav_ASR	so it i would say after three or four years it it it is getting better
84-1_2224.89_2.489.wav_ASR	we're so we're going to
84-1_2228.519_2.26.wav_ASR	so the fellow who said
84-1_2231.118_5.52.wav_ASR	which i could remember the name of the place that he was involved with me
84-1_2237.538_4.0.wav_ASR	but he he has one son who was got three wonderful children
84-1_2242.058_2.84.wav_ASR	and they live in england
84-1_2245.216_14.64.wav_ASR	so my my friend who's now widow is has has fixed up a place i think an apartment
84-1_2260.677_6.594.wav_ASR	so i know that's where the party's gonna be because the apartment is an open house
84-1_2267.297_1.81.wav_ASR	he's been working at it for a couple years
84-1_2290.78_3.59.wav_ASR	oh interestingly enough i had one in my hand
84-1_2296.1_4.56.wav_ASR	and i like it one more than the other
84-1_2300.734_16.34.wav_ASR	one of the people who was part of the group from firstnamel is a fellow from new york city
84-1_2317.101_4.2.wav_ASR	and he has a peanut butter and jelly sandwich every day of the week
84-1_2321.761_2.78.wav_ASR	well what you do is you take two pieces of bread
84-1_2325.321_9.159.wav_ASR	my bread i have my bread in the freezer because i only have two slices of bread
84-1_2335.061_1.789.wav_ASR	so i take the pieces of bread
84-1_2336.89_7.96.wav_ASR	they i i they become a couple
84-1_2347.07_2.92.wav_ASR	then i have a special peanut butter that i love
84-1_2350.01_1.08.wav_ASR	we've been to college
84-1_2353.6_1.85.wav_ASR	well the peanut butter there is nice
84-1_2356.05_2.9.wav_ASR	oh so that's the peanut butter i guess
84-1_2359.35_3.68.wav_ASR	and i we have a photograph of it
84-1_2363.63_3.48.wav_ASR	so i would open the jar take some peanut butter
84-1_2367.83_2.504.wav_ASR	and then i would take different kinds of drugs
84-1_2370.434_9.058.wav_ASR	but right now i'm on a kick where i have it's like bruised blueberry strawberry and grape jelly
84-1_2380.014_1.86.wav_ASR	and i put that on the sandwich
84-1_2382.514_2.34.wav_ASR	then i close the sandwich
84-1_2385.454_3.553.wav_ASR	and you can either cut it in half or leave it in one piece
84-1_2389.007_2.9.wav_ASR	and for some stupid reason i always leave it at home
84-1_2392.387_1.62.wav_ASR	and i had one was a nice sandwich
84-1_2394.347_5.34.wav_ASR	so i had that about one thousand as i was preparing for my stroke
84-1_2413.71_5.31.wav_ASR	well firstnamew is something i still try to do but i think my wife helped a lot with that
84-1_2420.092_4.906.wav_ASR	oh i would choose what kind of territory i wanted to live in
84-1_2424.998_6.36.wav_ASR	but typically i would choose cold water because most of the stuff i need to wash is in cold water
84-1_2431.958_3.042.wav_ASR	so i would in the special we have a different one
84-1_2435.278_2.14.wav_ASR	well we live in the north
84-1_2437.656_7.8.wav_ASR	and we live in an area that useta be that was very good for me
84-1_2446.076_9.42.wav_ASR	but because we're getting ready to move next year we sold our condominium and we moved into a retirement community
84-1_2455.617_4.36.wav_ASR	so we would get the bread
84-1_2461.32_13.017.wav_ASR	one the water set it's a machine that it it it goes through the window
84-1_2474.39_1.33.wav_ASR	so there's nothing on the table
84-1_2476.55_1.89.wav_ASR	so we hafta roll the wheel
84-1_2479.39_8.06.wav_ASR	and then we put the the laundry detergent in it with the soap
84-1_2487.48_6.74.wav_ASR	and you can see it from the from the we can see it from the window
84-1_2495.135_8.325.wav_ASR	it's not something that's it's something that is either to help me or to hurt me
84-1_2504.52_2.52.wav_ASR	and so we put it on a plate
84-1_2507.302_4.58.wav_ASR	and it usually lasts for some reason for an hour and a half
84-1_2512.062_3.808.wav_ASR	but after an hour and a half the wash is done
84-1_2515.962_6.0.wav_ASR	and if we have particular clothes that need to be put on a line we would typically put them together
84-1_2522.162_4.18.wav_ASR	and the rest of it would go into the dryer where it should be
84-1_2526.352_8.24.wav_ASR	and then it would be ready to be folded and put in the cupboard that we use for peanut butter and jelly
84-1_2535.332_2.932.wav_ASR	my wife has quite a few more than i do
84-1_2538.264_8.158.wav_ASR	but it's a place where we can put our stuff and use it as we need it
84-1_2557.42_3.87.wav_ASR	well you hafta understand that now i have it in my head
84-1_2562.42_5.82.wav_ASR	so i usually get up in the morning
84-1_2568.47_8.6.wav_ASR	and i will have a stroke
84-1_2578.86_3.09.wav_ASR	and then i would put on my slacks
84-1_2583.37_2.06.wav_ASR	and i would put on my shirt
84-1_2586.38_6.68.wav_ASR	and then i would lie in bed for a little bit and do some exercise because exercise is good for me
84-1_2593.52_9.62.wav_ASR	especially even though i'm really more than three years out it still important for me to do my job
84-1_2603.74_0.96.wav_ASR	so i do that
84-1_2604.776_5.64.wav_ASR	and then i'll typically one that is done i'll turn it off
84-1_2610.876_6.2.wav_ASR	and i'll get dressed the rest of my way which includes
84-1_2617.536_4.7.wav_ASR	you haven't seen this but i wear a bracelet on my right hand
84-1_2622.416_1.873.wav_ASR	so i put that on as well
84-1_2624.77_4.28.wav_ASR	and i i stopped working
84-2_12.09_1.1.wav_ASR	my favorite hotel
84-2_13.79_9.28.wav_ASR	it's easy thinking because i have a very small family but usually the family comes to visit me
84-2_24.03_1.468.wav_ASR	and now one of them's married
84-2_25.77_2.32.wav_ASR	and the other is gonna be married pretty soon
84-2_28.25_4.26.wav_ASR	so i look forward to a table with a few friends
84-2_32.564_2.32.wav_ASR	well i have two sons
84-2_35.624_2.44.wav_ASR	one of them who lives i think i told you in the morning
84-2_38.244_1.46.wav_ASR	one of them lives in chicago
84-2_40.424_2.76.wav_ASR	so they typically do that
84-2_43.573_14.028.wav_ASR	and for many many years i had my stroke i was in charge of the cooking at the restaurant
84-2_58.053_1.58.wav_ASR	so it's really really nice
84-2_60.413_2.52.wav_ASR	now i don't do it on the gridiron anymore
84-2_63.47_4.5.wav_ASR	and we useta have a place at the shore but we don't have much
84-2_68.71_4.28.wav_ASR	so i somebody else could come in
84-2_78.94_7.65.wav_ASR	well i've been the host for thanksgiving since my mother died
84-2_86.96_1.04.wav_ASR	so it's been awhile
84-2_92.66_0.372.wav_ASR	it is
84-2_93.22_2.6.wav_ASR	it's nice but it doesn't last for very long
84-2_100.512_2.1.wav_ASR	we celebrate holidays
84-2_103.112_6.44.wav_ASR	and so we we typically we don't even speak much to each other
84-2_109.668_11.36.wav_ASR	unfortunately both of the young ladies that my two sons married are now dead
84-2_121.788_3.708.wav_ASR	one of them i think has no relation which is fine with me
84-2_125.777_3.18.wav_ASR	and one of them i think is basically
84-2_130.297_4.6.wav_ASR	but i think she likes celebrating happy times
84-2_154.92_3.84.wav_ASR	my speech is probably the thing that i'm working on right now
84-2_159.16_7.84.wav_ASR	as you know i useta be a lawyer and i've just i've just gone back to school
84-2_167.46_3.07.wav_ASR	so i can still be a lawyer if i want to
84-2_171.22_15.68.wav_ASR	but i i feel that a lot of times especially with small words and poor nouns and with her and not being able to say anything
84-2_187.36_3.34.wav_ASR	so that that like i hafta think for a minute
84-2_190.722_2.64.wav_ASR	especially now that firstnamel did it
84-2_193.622_1.4.wav_ASR	or it doesn't all the dirt and
84-2_195.302_2.954.wav_ASR	and i hafta remember which is left and which is right
84-2_198.782_1.54.wav_ASR	that consists me so much
84-2_200.742_3.33.wav_ASR	and i'm i'm pretty good about back and forth with her
84-2_204.582_2.796.wav_ASR	and i'm hoping that i'll be able to drive at school again
84-2_207.378_8.784.wav_ASR	well not that i've always driven a lot but i've never been i've been driving a lot
84-2_216.44_9.7.wav_ASR	just do it because my wife sits in the other seat and my two kids when they were around something they would drive me crazy
84-2_227.22_6.2.wav_ASR	but now since my stroke my wife is a nurse
84-2_234.05_6.33.wav_ASR	and as i say i think maybe in a year or so i may be able to talk again
84-2_240.74_0.76.wav_ASR	and i'm not sure
84-2_247.16_2.58.wav_ASR	don't tell my wife that because it's a surprise
84-2_257.54_0.74.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
84-2_263.0_2.98.wav_ASR	oh yeah i remember my stroke pretty well
84-2_273.18_11.211.wav_ASR	well i was in the hospital for about eight days before i went to the rehab program which is also connected to a speech therapist
84-2_285.39_20.682.wav_ASR	and that's where in my area of town we go down instead of going up to firstnamet which is probably about maybe ten miles away
84-2_306.65_15.44.wav_ASR	and i remember you know i think i told you that on sunday morning i went out to get and i went out because there was a ride the night before
84-2_322.53_1.5.wav_ASR	well i forgot his name right now
84-2_324.03_2.88.wav_ASR	so there's a huge one
84-2_327.03_2.723.wav_ASR	we had a building actually burned down
84-2_330.29_4.617.wav_ASR	and i went out at about six o'clock in the morning to start working again
84-2_335.07_2.209.wav_ASR	and i was one of the few people out there
84-2_337.63_2.1.wav_ASR	and i remember there being a ton of cleaning up
84-2_339.843_5.105.wav_ASR	and so i was there from about six to twelve o'clock at night
84-2_345.103_1.957.wav_ASR	and then i went to get another one
84-2_347.387_0.994.wav_ASR	it didn't feel good
84-2_348.683_2.769.wav_ASR	so i lie lie lay down for a long time
84-2_351.763_2.48.wav_ASR	and then i went to work in the office
84-2_354.303_6.287.wav_ASR	and by the evening i was starting to feel a little worse but not too bad
84-2_361.05_2.15.wav_ASR	and i went to bed around ten o'clock
84-2_364.003_2.577.wav_ASR	and i had my stroke in the middle of the night
84-2_367.183_3.063.wav_ASR	and in the morning my wife could not get away
84-2_370.723_2.645.wav_ASR	so we have a conference who came up and said
84-2_373.648_1.7.wav_ASR	and they took me to the hospital
84-2_375.668_2.58.wav_ASR	that's when i spent about eight days in the hospital
84-2_378.928_4.34.wav_ASR	because i was in the hospital
84-2_383.468_2.537.wav_ASR	so i really didn't see anybody there
84-2_386.828_5.56.wav_ASR	and i had it was difficult for me because i feel felt my talk was not clear
84-2_392.4_3.057.wav_ASR	and i also it was just difficult for me
84-2_395.58_4.82.wav_ASR	so it was i must have been in the hospital
84-2_400.74_2.02.wav_ASR	and it i was in a room by myself
84-2_402.991_12.52.wav_ASR	and eventually on a monday night the about a week and a half i went to miami which is only two hours away
84-2_415.551_0.838.wav_ASR	it was pretty close
84-2_416.971_3.157.wav_ASR	so that's when i stayed for three or four months
84-2_430.74_2.047.wav_ASR	oh i've done a lot of things to try to get it
84-2_433.0_1.662.wav_ASR	and i don't know if all the work is done
84-2_435.24_3.841.wav_ASR	so i was in the hospital for four months
84-2_439.239_9.64.wav_ASR	and every day except the weekend i had a headache
84-2_449.599_1.36.wav_ASR	and then i also had speech
84-2_451.039_1.499.wav_ASR	that was typically in the morning
84-2_453.139_4.394.wav_ASR	and then in the afternoon i for a while i didn't know what was going on
84-2_457.533_3.458.wav_ASR	but then eventually i started going to school
84-2_461.433_4.9.wav_ASR	and i i did some stuff but it wasn't really good
84-2_467.093_6.865.wav_ASR	and i thought by the time i left there i wasn't so happy about it
84-2_474.15_7.18.wav_ASR	so i tried it a little bit more at miami which is very good for me
84-2_481.83_0.958.wav_ASR	and it wasn't growing
84-2_483.11_2.78.wav_ASR	soon they introduced a music program
84-2_486.65_2.184.wav_ASR	and i was always interested in him
84-2_489.35_2.38.wav_ASR	but i don't sing that much
84-2_491.79_3.961.wav_ASR	and i don't always sing or anything
84-2_496.23_1.816.wav_ASR	oh i thought it might be
84-2_498.25_2.78.wav_ASR	so i took some singing lessons which i still do today
84-2_501.63_4.7.wav_ASR	and then olivette at temple there's an english teacher
84-2_506.586_10.4.wav_ASR	and so there's a singing program there which i think i like better because i get real songs and stuff like that you know
84-2_517.118_19.5.wav_ASR	and i'm on top of a thing called ipod where we try to do stuff to help people learn about aphasia and see if they can use it
84-2_563.78_6.71.wav_ASR	well i have a lot of good experiences because i've had a pretty good life
84-2_570.49_11.14.wav_ASR	and i spent up until first grade i went to school in a suburb of clermont clermont pennsylvania
84-2_582.166_13.72.wav_ASR	and then between my first and second graduate years i moved to chicago and was working at a law firm
84-2_596.144_6.909.wav_ASR	and so going up by i i i was presented to a speech therapist
84-2_603.184_3.92.wav_ASR	and i was not a great athlete but i was an okay one
84-2_607.264_4.74.wav_ASR	so i usually make the last play on the team with the second last play of the game
84-2_612.29_4.45.wav_ASR	and i really like playing hockey which we did outdoors
84-2_617.81_12.14.wav_ASR	and so i would say i learned a lot of information from firstnameh just just about the game and about the rules of the game
84-2_630.86_17.583.wav_ASR	and eventually eventually when i was in my what's called the baltimore leg of the hospital
84-2_648.56_1.971.wav_ASR	so that was a really nice opportunity for me
84-2_650.531_4.636.wav_ASR	and i was in the hospital
84-2_655.371_2.836.wav_ASR	my i was on the bioness i was not at home
84-2_658.411_5.549.wav_ASR	but but there's enough plastics on the beam that i was pretty happy about
84-2_664.191_1.68.wav_ASR	and all of them were from miami
84-2_666.031_2.66.wav_ASR	so it was when i first came in there
84-2_668.951_1.04.wav_ASR	and she's in new york city
84-2_670.145_2.671.wav_ASR	so it was really nice to meet all the people
84-2_673.365_10.54.wav_ASR	and we would have games basically from lafayette and from lake michigan
84-2_684.865_2.36.wav_ASR	so it was just nice to get to know some people
84-2_693.81_2.2.wav_ASR	and i did get hurt by a football
84-2_696.361_5.44.wav_ASR	and i broke my window
84-2_706.07_1.072.wav_ASR	it wasn't that big
84-2_710.85_1.037.wav_ASR	it it can be
84-2_712.13_2.397.wav_ASR	but it wasn't bad
84-2_714.67_2.22.wav_ASR	maybe it wasn't a particularly bad one
84-2_717.63_4.6.wav_ASR	but i remember i came home and i still wasn't making sense
84-2_722.231_11.86.wav_ASR	so my dad took me to what was then called evanston hospital which is now part of northwestern university
84-2_735.0_4.82.wav_ASR	and so i remember i did some exercises with her
84-2_740.071_1.66.wav_ASR	and they said i had a stroke coming
84-2_741.98_7.66.wav_ASR	so i i think i you know i i think i i actually don't know what's going on
84-2_751.48_1.24.wav_ASR	maybe it was only one
84-2_753.1_1.699.wav_ASR	and then i also broke my head
84-2_755.56_1.969.wav_ASR	well i can't remember exactly how he went
84-2_765.892_4.149.wav_ASR	yeah you you can't have a cat in the tree
84-2_776.028_1.013.wav_ASR	take the knife
84-2_777.152_1.08.wav_ASR	you can stay at rest in peace
84-2_781.243_1.08.wav_ASR	oh well
84-2_785.063_2.76.wav_ASR	yeah so did you do that in college
84-2_797.763_0.72.wav_ASR	oh good
84-2_845.89_2.26.wav_ASR	oh yes that's the same thing we saw earlier
84-2_858.01_2.94.wav_ASR	so it's the story of a young girl
84-2_861.0_5.48.wav_ASR	he's around twelve years old kicking a soccer ball around
84-2_867.26_13.14.wav_ASR	and i guess one of the airforce kids went through a plate glass window and landed next to someone who was probably either riding a bike or something
84-2_880.69_3.33.wav_ASR	and so he saw the ball coming through the window
84-2_884.43_10.34.wav_ASR	and he noticed that a lamp had come a lamp had come to rest under the tree
84-2_895.09_3.248.wav_ASR	and i could see the ball coming down
84-2_898.338_2.865.wav_ASR	so he might have cut it in half
84-2_902.03_2.001.wav_ASR	and he wasn't sure what to do
84-2_904.138_2.02.wav_ASR	so he saw that glass was broken
84-2_906.678_4.26.wav_ASR	so we went over to the window to see what was going on
84-2_911.418_4.592.wav_ASR	and i'm assuming that he saw the person who kicked the ball through the window
84-2_916.01_6.4.wav_ASR	but then perhaps but by then the person with the scooter came along
84-2_930.177_7.24.wav_ASR	so it's the story of a young boy who was on his way to school
84-2_938.237_5.22.wav_ASR	and he wasn't sure that he was going to make it
84-2_943.61_7.119.wav_ASR	so he decided that he wouldn't take an umbrella because it maybe didn't need to be taken
84-2_951.25_5.94.wav_ASR	but as soon as she stepped outside and started walking a little bit the rain started
84-2_957.89_1.84.wav_ASR	so he went back to his house
84-2_959.73_4.444.wav_ASR	and i he was all the time
84-2_964.39_3.26.wav_ASR	and his mother had a stern look on her face
84-2_967.95_1.755.wav_ASR	but there was nothing he could do
84-2_969.89_4.927.wav_ASR	so he got some news and went back out into the rain
84-2_975.35_1.92.wav_ASR	but this time he had an umbrella
84-2_988.79_6.25.wav_ASR	this is the picture of a young lady who had a cat stuck in the tree
84-2_995.279_8.66.wav_ASR	so he she got off his tricycle and saw i think it was a bicycle
84-2_1004.61_2.312.wav_ASR	his dad climbed up the tree
84-2_1007.139_3.56.wav_ASR	then then ladder broke and fell to the ground
84-2_1011.04_7.14.wav_ASR	there is a a stepmother who's trying to see if maybe the man will marry her
84-2_1018.34_18.709.wav_ASR	but she he was up there and needed to be rescued by the fire department who came out and was going to get the husband down from the tree
84-2_1188.82_0.522.wav_ASR	got you
84-2_1190.29_11.04.wav_ASR	well so this is a story about cinderella and her two daughters
84-2_1202.87_5.93.wav_ASR	so i believe that cinderella didn't go to the ball
84-2_1208.85_10.08.wav_ASR	and since she was able to get a job with the two stepsisters
84-2_1219.6_12.86.wav_ASR	and she was doing a lot of stuff like washing the clothes and cleaning the the cleaning the floors and doing stuff like that at the house
84-2_1233.61_13.66.wav_ASR	then it came to pass that there was a prince who lived in the castle with his father and cinderella
84-2_1247.87_7.51.wav_ASR	and he he was looking for somebody to marry
84-2_1255.91_10.09.wav_ASR	so they everybody in the town got an invitation to this big party at the castle
84-2_1266.0_7.976.wav_ASR	so the two stepsisters dressed up in fine clothes and the mother came to the ball
84-2_1273.976_12.38.wav_ASR	and they were the the prince the king was going to marry
84-2_1286.996_3.0.wav_ASR	and so she he decided to have this party
84-2_1290.119_5.02.wav_ASR	and so they were very happy
84-2_1295.299_12.78.wav_ASR	and then a fairy godmother came along and said to the young woman cinderella that cinderella should go to the ball
84-2_1308.226_9.88.wav_ASR	so he she was able to get a dress and some nice clothing and a beautiful gown
84-2_1319.006_8.0.wav_ASR	and they were somehow involved with me
84-2_1327.231_10.9.wav_ASR	and they came to the wedding in a special charity event which had a rider and i think of my father
84-2_1338.211_7.36.wav_ASR	and they came out at the at the hospital and said
84-2_1345.673_6.279.wav_ASR	and the the the car is coming
84-2_1352.133_2.54.wav_ASR	and the prince saw her
84-2_1355.293_3.02.wav_ASR	and they had a very good time
84-2_1358.335_10.88.wav_ASR	but the prince had the cinderella had been told that she was going to go
84-2_1370.035_5.014.wav_ASR	so as the clock struck twelve she knew she hadta leave
84-2_1375.049_3.707.wav_ASR	so he left and left the princess
84-2_1378.756_17.48.wav_ASR	and as he went out to the carriage the prince cinderella turned back into a beautiful woman
84-2_1396.299_11.02.wav_ASR	and the prince prince was really upset about cinderella
84-2_1407.593_17.28.wav_ASR	so she he sent some people from from his his people to see if they could find a wife
84-2_1425.678_6.62.wav_ASR	and so she went to different houses and couldn't find the slipper
84-2_1432.618_11.82.wav_ASR	when he went to the house where the two stepsisters live she was wonderful to them
84-2_1444.93_13.02.wav_ASR	and somehow i think maybe he figured out that the young lady who was dancing with the prince
84-2_1458.25_1.72.wav_ASR	so he brought up cinderella
84-2_1460.57_2.92.wav_ASR	and the shoes fit
84-2_1463.42_8.56.wav_ASR	so he went back to the prince and told him that she was gone
84-2_1472.66_6.16.wav_ASR	and eventually the person became close again with me
84-2_1480.57_3.74.wav_ASR	and and in the end the prince and cinderella got married
84-2_1514.01_3.94.wav_ASR	well i don't remember what i talked about last time
84-2_1518.63_6.689.wav_ASR	so there was always a clock in the background
84-2_1526.11_3.865.wav_ASR	and so i i knew pretty easily what time it was
84-2_1530.23_1.698.wav_ASR	oh i think i know the story
84-2_1531.9_8.72.wav_ASR	and so i remember especially in high school that there wasn't really anyone to talk to
84-2_1541.12_5.3.wav_ASR	so my parents said that you know when you get married
84-2_1546.84_4.825.wav_ASR	you know obviously not too late but you know you wanna get married
84-2_1551.665_5.02.wav_ASR	so especially on friday and saturday nights we go together
84-2_1556.735_4.043.wav_ASR	you useta drive in one of my friends' neighborhood and go up there
84-2_1561.105_4.17.wav_ASR	and so we would go to different parties which was a lot of fun
84-2_1565.275_7.34.wav_ASR	but i always made it home especially one time i actually flew there
84-2_1573.075_7.54.wav_ASR	but i was in the hospital
84-2_1580.922_5.48.wav_ASR	and somebody else named one of my friends who was named firstnamet was in the hospital
84-2_1587.065_3.064.wav_ASR	and he he yelled at me
84-2_1590.202_0.83.wav_ASR	and i woke up
84-2_1591.802_1.28.wav_ASR	and it was in stockton
84-2_1593.302_0.94.wav_ASR	so nothing happened
84-2_1594.562_1.16.wav_ASR	and i was pretty lucky
84-2_1595.743_6.552.wav_ASR	so i guess it it's just good to know that a clock is always there to tell time
84-2_1602.295_18.18.wav_ASR	and hopefully you know i i then when i was in college i useta i had a couple different girls where i was from in in westminster colorado springs
84-2_1621.213_5.323.wav_ASR	and so i had a job that started at six o'clock in the morning and went till midnight
84-2_1626.636_8.781.wav_ASR	so i useta stay out with my friends or at my girlfriend's house until about four in the morning and then go to work
84-2_1635.473_3.123.wav_ASR	or i would come home and get my bike and then go to school
84-2_1638.596_3.3.wav_ASR	so it was fine but it was also pretty good
84-2_1661.747_12.78.wav_ASR	and i think the only thing i can say about birds is that growing up i pretty much took
84-2_1674.744_11.46.wav_ASR	and i remember even when i was in university and when i went to los angeles i didn't speak at all
84-2_1686.85_16.941.wav_ASR	but as i started to get well i i i guess i should say that i worked a lot in the hospital
84-2_1703.791_4.937.wav_ASR	and then i went to a community where i was able to do that
84-2_1709.271_8.12.wav_ASR	but now that i'm looking for stuff to do one of the things i'm pretty interesting about it is
84-2_1718.071_2.377.wav_ASR	so it's something i'm gonna try to do
84-2_1720.448_13.26.wav_ASR	well i i'm sure i told you but maybe i didn't that my that me and my wife are gonna move to south carolina and in a couple of years we'll get married
84-2_1734.128_1.611.wav_ASR	so i like to try it on
84-2_1735.948_1.252.wav_ASR	and i hope i'm good
84-2_1737.348_1.265.wav_ASR	and i hope i know what i'm doing
84-2_1738.613_8.402.wav_ASR	but it's important for me to find some hobbies that i can work on and try to get better
84-2_1751.233_2.428.wav_ASR	oh we've already picked one up
84-2_1753.973_1.755.wav_ASR	and the jelly jelly jelly
84-2_1755.813_0.848.wav_ASR	everybody been there
84-2_1757.804_3.6.wav_ASR	and it's off the code of
84-2_1763.495_4.149.wav_ASR	about forty minutes from the charterhouse
84-2_1768.604_1.36.wav_ASR	and it's a beautiful dress
84-2_1772.244_3.34.wav_ASR	well i don't wanna go to too many places
84-2_1775.781_12.445.wav_ASR	but we we are constructing a place there that's part of a community mental health organization
84-2_1788.901_5.343.wav_ASR	and so so my wife is down the street
84-2_1794.244_5.8.wav_ASR	and so she could actually go into the ball and dance with the prince
84-2_1800.532_16.3.wav_ASR	and she was able to tell me that from where our community is place my wife says that she can actually go to the dance
84-2_1817.192_13.006.wav_ASR	so for me that was really nice because i've always have a place in alexandria where my wife and i used to live
84-2_1830.198_1.1.wav_ASR	it was laid on the water
84-2_1831.912_4.94.wav_ASR	and so now i feel that i've been able to give something to people
84-2_1837.124_5.433.wav_ASR	some i've wanted to find a place that would be good for me
84-2_1843.004_3.038.wav_ASR	and i think it's gonna be a little hot for me
84-2_1846.364_6.04.wav_ASR	but i think it's gonna be worse than it was gonna be a great one
84-2_1861.804_4.88.wav_ASR	the helicopter is it's in south carolina
84-2_1868.964_0.303.wav_ASR	wait a minute
84-2_1877.712_1.04.wav_ASR	well it's pretty consistent
84-2_1879.112_1.64.wav_ASR	and i'm not very concerned about it
84-2_1882.912_1.763.wav_ASR	yes i think it should be
84-2_1885.012_4.164.wav_ASR	and we know some people down there who are friends
84-2_1889.212_1.86.wav_ASR	so that's gonna be really helpful for me
84-2_1891.217_9.274.wav_ASR	but the person i know really well made a fortune in real estate
84-2_1900.657_4.7.wav_ASR	so he has a lot of places now all over the world and everything
84-2_1929.085_7.92.wav_ASR	well probably the hotel i stayed in some good places
84-2_1937.925_5.3.wav_ASR	but probably the nicest hotel i stayed in was in chicago
84-2_1943.216_11.64.wav_ASR	when i was in los angeles when i was in college who came with me
84-2_1955.736_3.62.wav_ASR	so we got married at the four seasons hotel in philadelphia
84-2_1960.256_1.29.wav_ASR	and that was a real nice place
84-2_1961.546_2.702.wav_ASR	we we were able to be there for a couple of days
84-2_1964.566_2.56.wav_ASR	we had a fireman at our house
84-2_1967.137_1.529.wav_ASR	and i think it was about two hundred dollars
84-2_1969.686_5.86.wav_ASR	and we were able to have a wedding on the same day
84-2_1976.586_2.56.wav_ASR	and we had a nice time
84-2_1979.209_12.504.wav_ASR	and then i remember that many of my friends went down in georgia town and with my wife and firstnamel
84-2_1992.089_1.731.wav_ASR	so for me it was a good place
84-2_1994.369_2.18.wav_ASR	but really i like being alone
84-2_1996.549_3.359.wav_ASR	so i you know
84-2_1999.989_0.545.wav_ASR	it was good
84-2_2000.709_3.348.wav_ASR	you know i like being where i am
84-2_2196.154_4.351.wav_ASR	well i think i told you about my favorite restaurant in new york city
84-2_2200.505_1.925.wav_ASR	one that i went to for about twenty years
84-2_2204.4_1.8.wav_ASR	oh i won't talk about that
84-2_2206.653_12.64.wav_ASR	well here in philadelphia i had a stroke
84-2_2219.853_5.936.wav_ASR	because i lived here when i first came here
84-2_2225.789_3.92.wav_ASR	and i was a laptop for a judge or something
84-2_2230.669_3.36.wav_ASR	and then i lived here for awhile before i moved away
84-2_2234.197_14.716.wav_ASR	but one of the places i like to eat a lot is going up in pittsburgh pennsylvania
84-2_2249.537_1.139.wav_ASR	and i don't know if i told you
84-2_2250.676_4.494.wav_ASR	but i useta be able to speak french and all that
84-2_2255.756_5.814.wav_ASR	and i like going there because they have a lot of work
84-2_2262.196_5.2.wav_ASR	most of it is gone too it's got to be overpriced like that
84-2_2267.49_9.604.wav_ASR	but one thing i really like there is my my
84-2_2277.79_5.42.wav_ASR	and it's and it can be kick one two three four five
84-2_2283.415_9.06.wav_ASR	and i like my meat very rare not cook not properly cooked at all
84-2_2293.155_8.88.wav_ASR	and it's a really nice place to get a jelly burger and either a salad or some peanut butter
84-2_2302.33_4.163.wav_ASR	if the friends are usually far away
84-2_2307.01_2.4.wav_ASR	so i usually find up getting a sandwich
84-2_2309.77_7.26.wav_ASR	but sometimes she makes me order the the the she makes me order
84-2_2336.29_0.91.wav_ASR	oh we had this done
84-2_2337.64_6.1.wav_ASR	well the peanut butter and jelly sandwich for me is pretty good
84-2_2344.78_4.14.wav_ASR	my go to the most of my bread is in one hand
84-2_2349.56_2.46.wav_ASR	so i take out two pieces of bread
84-2_2352.03_13.906.wav_ASR	well i like a particular kind of peanut butter that is made at cracker barrel
84-2_2365.936_10.164.wav_ASR	and so i usually put one peanut butter jelly sandwich which later has been arranged a little more to my liking
84-2_2376.676_2.695.wav_ASR	and then i'll take just about anything
84-2_2379.371_10.336.wav_ASR	but i've found a jelly at that has peanut butter that has no peanuts in it
84-2_2389.5_27.09.wav_ASR	and so i put that with some peanut butter on a bread that is peanut butter and jelly
84-2_2416.69_4.042.wav_ASR	so i i'm gonna have a sandwich a little bit of peanut butter
84-2_2420.83_1.92.wav_ASR	and i'm probably gonna have a turkey sandwich
84-2_2423.13_2.155.wav_ASR	but yeah i like peanut butter and jelly sandwich
84-2_2425.63_8.46.wav_ASR	and i've got the i've got the sandwich in my hand
84-2_2440.382_15.965.wav_ASR	well we i think i may have told you that we useta call each other a lot of times
84-2_2456.416_4.325.wav_ASR	but we found somebody that we thought we could sell it to
84-2_2460.976_7.3.wav_ASR	and it turned out that the two of them bought it at a price that i couldn't afford
84-2_2468.485_11.2.wav_ASR	so while we're waiting for the place to be built in kelowna we moved it turns out across the whole country
84-2_2479.5_13.0.wav_ASR	and it so and there's a washer and a dryer with all the
84-2_2493.08_0.68.wav_ASR	the roads
84-2_2494.18_4.5.wav_ASR	all the locations i guess you could say have a washer and dryer
84-2_2499.03_7.61.wav_ASR	so usually there may be a couple pieces of cloth that may go to the bread
84-2_2506.81_8.7.wav_ASR	but for the most part i will open the jar of peanut butter
84-2_2516.541_5.6.wav_ASR	it's a washer that it it applies to the clothes
84-2_2522.721_4.203.wav_ASR	so i've put all the clothes in which is something i'm still able to do
84-2_2527.541_5.5.wav_ASR	and then i will turn on the radio
84-2_2533.721_1.86.wav_ASR	usually it's on a cold side
84-2_2535.923_4.6.wav_ASR	and once it starts moving a little bit i put my head down
84-2_2541.603_5.972.wav_ASR	and for some reason this this washer it takes a long time
84-2_2548.263_2.18.wav_ASR	but in about an hour it's done
84-2_2550.963_2.58.wav_ASR	and the clothes have always come up pretty good
84-2_2553.677_3.5.wav_ASR	so i then put them in the dryer
84-2_2558.157_3.06.wav_ASR	and that's about another forty five years
84-2_2561.777_10.454.wav_ASR	but usually with in two hours the clothes come out and they're ready to be folded which for me takes about an hour
84-2_2572.231_6.68.wav_ASR	so what i've tried to do is just lift the stuff that i like a little bit more
84-2_2579.691_1.311.wav_ASR	and firstnamel is at her home
84-2_2582.091_6.46.wav_ASR	yeah she her clothes get washed with mine but i can't remember what they look like
84-2_2588.911_1.977.wav_ASR	and she's got a lot more coloring than i have
84-2_2605.921_5.7.wav_ASR	well i i grew up in chicago
84-2_2612.441_6.897.wav_ASR	but somehow when i married firstnamel that was not one of the things that she was willing to do
84-2_2619.338_7.26.wav_ASR	so we we have a fee not a lot of fees that are involved
84-2_2627.098_3.1.wav_ASR	but i had a birthday in july
84-2_2630.778_6.74.wav_ASR	and one of the people i've become very close with is a personal assistant
84-2_2637.618_7.84.wav_ASR	and so firstnamej has been with me for about a year now
84-2_2645.678_7.36.wav_ASR	and she got a small plant for me that is the only living plant i have
84-2_2654.178_0.9.wav_ASR	and for some reason
84-2_2655.359_3.54.wav_ASR	and i got it at the end of
84-2_2661.499_3.353.wav_ASR	and for some reason the plan is still challenging me
84-2_2664.959_0.989.wav_ASR	doing pretty well
84-2_2666.159_8.647.wav_ASR	so i feel good that i can keep a plant now for what is it
84-2_2681.403_5.463.wav_ASR	the biggest issue is that i don't hafta water the plants
84-2_2689.146_3.773.wav_ASR	but i can show it to you but i don't know
84-2_2692.919_6.577.wav_ASR	maybe at the end if we have enough time i'll speak up
84-2_2699.679_5.76.wav_ASR	but it it's just hard for me to see because it's on my left side
84-2_2707.71_1.15.wav_ASR	are you big on playing
84-2_2725.24_2.756.wav_ASR	well find the easy ones to start with

61-1_226.007_5.97.wav_ASR	well i i was in rehab for four months
61-1_233.191_11.69.wav_ASR	and i finally got to the point where i could no longer speak
61-1_245.707_15.99.wav_ASR	and i could speak more terms and more words
61-1_262.172_3.67.wav_ASR	and i didn't have any movement of my body
61-1_266.267_3.84.wav_ASR	the ladder fell down

61-1_592.076_3.31.wav_ASR	and so he walked and he got wet
61-1_595.58_1.7.wav_ASR	and he was all dressed up
61-1_598.168_0.88.wav_ASR	and he came home
61-1_599.072_1.87.wav_ASR	and he was all dressed up

61-1_645.588_4.39.wav_ASR	there was a girl underneath crying for the cat
61-1_651.054_4.93.wav_ASR	and then they called for the ambulance
61-1_656.707_2.71.wav_ASR	and the two guys with the ladder fell
61-1_659.432_3.79.wav_ASR	and the dog was kind of yelling
61-1_663.272_13.78.wav_ASR	and then they would have been happy ever after

63-2_87.247_4.1.wav_ASR	and that's the last thing i remember for a long time
63-2_110.622_8.52.wav_ASR	well the the last thing i knew before my stroke hit was
63-2_119.546_6.29.wav_ASR	well after my stroke it was very difficult
63-2_125.884_5.95.wav_ASR	and i remember this was an ambulance
63-2_131.943_3.96.wav_ASR	so the next thing i know i'm back in my chair
63-2_137.638_4.23.wav_ASR	and i a ladder
63-2_141.886_3.02.wav_ASR	my wife and i
63-2_145.895_8.26.wav_ASR	and and i slowly started talking
63-2_154.83_6.86.wav_ASR	but i don't think i made much of an impression
63-2_161.771_2.36.wav_ASR	but she was always there for me
63-2_166.318_5.94.wav_ASR	so it it was okay because i i could tell the difference
63-2_172.567_0.74.wav_ASR	and she missed
63-2_174.287_2.43.wav_ASR	did or whatever she was
63-2_179.54_8.31.wav_ASR	and then after a while two or three nurses came in
63-2_187.899_9.62.wav_ASR	and they would do crazy things like lift my legs and all that
63-2_197.735_3.12.wav_ASR	and every day it was something different
63-2_200.878_1.4.wav_ASR	and i would go down the hospital
63-2_203.68_13.15.wav_ASR	and they would do leg lifts looking at the mirror
63-2_216.852_3.61.wav_ASR	and i i would do disney
63-2_220.72_2.27.wav_ASR	well i remember that i just started
63-2_223.735_6.54.wav_ASR	did a lot of
63-2_231.307_0.98.wav_ASR	and i don't know
63-2_232.337_1.88.wav_ASR	there was always somebody there
63-2_234.266_4.36.wav_ASR	and there were always somebody doing something else
63-2_238.866_2.82.wav_ASR	lot of it i don't know what to say
63-2_241.734_6.07.wav_ASR	but it it was very good for the first couple weeks i it was very good
63-2_270.707_16.25.wav_ASR	well the the the the best thing i can remember before my stroke is that i was in college
63-2_287.802_2.96.wav_ASR	and i was in the service now
63-2_290.815_10.36.wav_ASR	but we before my before i was a professional officer i was also in the air force as a pilot
63-2_302.963_14.46.wav_ASR	so other from that i think the the thing that i i do the most about is in writing
63-2_318.711_10.5.wav_ASR	well i i was very interested in basketball and football and especially soccer
63-2_330.401_3.01.wav_ASR	had a lot of good memories about it
63-2_335.59_16.4.wav_ASR	yeah i i'm not long away from home but after the session i was the person in charge
63-2_352.759_1.93.wav_ASR	had a lot of insurance
63-2_356.795_1.32.wav_ASR	well a lot of things happen to me
63-2_358.702_5.14.wav_ASR	but there's a little girl
63-2_363.887_3.23.wav_ASR	well there's so much to do
63-2_367.253_10.28.wav_ASR	the fact you know there's so many things good and bad in life
63-2_377.551_2.11.wav_ASR	and i i can't do much
63-2_379.803_3.54.wav_ASR	the fact that is a lot of my don't even remember it
63-2_384.569_2.54.wav_ASR	they're either traveling or
63-2_387.736_1.31.wav_ASR	but that that's the way it goes
63-2_411.303_0.58.wav_ASR	okay
63-2_413.03_4.45.wav_ASR	there was a boy who kicked the ball
63-2_417.912_3.64.wav_ASR	and the ball went into a glass slipper
63-2_422.674_15.1.wav_ASR	and when it went into the window and it hit the guy on the on the stairs and and knocked over the the lamp
63-2_438.726_2.45.wav_ASR	and so she he grabbed the slipper
63-2_442.108_7.4.wav_ASR	and he he told him he wasn't getting it back til the next day
63-2_481.005_0.36.wav_ASR	okay
63-2_481.732_8.03.wav_ASR	first of all the boy did not want to take the umbrella
63-2_491.361_5.2.wav_ASR	he she she said it was okay to go
63-2_497.241_6.7.wav_ASR	so he he walked out to in the rain and got wet
63-2_504.464_2.37.wav_ASR	so she hadta go back home
63-2_508.083_4.21.wav_ASR	and he he was all alone
63-2_512.317_9.689.wav_ASR	and so she hadta get out of there
63-2_522.629_3.17.wav_ASR	and she put it in her hand
63-2_525.853_3.21.wav_ASR	and he went to school
63-2_544.992_0.48.wav_ASR	okay
63-2_557.835_3.71.wav_ASR	okay first of all i see a man
63-2_561.562_1.48.wav_ASR	and she's trying to get it
63-2_564.448_3.49.wav_ASR	but her her hair
63-2_568.152_0.97.wav_ASR	so she couldn't go
63-2_569.138_10.13.wav_ASR	so she she went to her father father who couldn't get it either because the he had a stroke
63-2_579.979_9.18.wav_ASR	and he had a dog that was barking
63-2_589.176_4.92.wav_ASR	and and i said
63-2_594.116_4.12.wav_ASR	and the up up the tree trying to get it down
63-2_599.141_4.71.wav_ASR	and so because of that
63-2_603.984_1.24.wav_ASR	and she couldn't get the girl
63-2_606.497_1.25.wav_ASR	couldn't get the dog
63-2_608.377_9.35.wav_ASR	and she went with the firemen who got her out and gave her an umbrella
63-2_1440.511_0.74.wav_ASR	okay
63-2_1441.268_16.0.wav_ASR	when the grandmother and her two grandchildren were small they brought in cinderella
63-2_1458.806_6.78.wav_ASR	and cinderella went to the ball
63-2_1466.686_10.03.wav_ASR	and as kids got older there were more things for cinderella to do that she could do
63-2_1478.756_14.77.wav_ASR	and finally they they got an invitation from the prince that there was gonna be a gala at the palace
63-2_1495.182_6.21.wav_ASR	and they they told her she couldn't go because she wasn't there
63-2_1501.414_1.13.wav_ASR	it only lay there
63-2_1503.72_13.93.wav_ASR	so after they were gone the fairy godmother showed up and and told cinderella
63-2_1518.63_15.49.wav_ASR	and so the first thing the fairy godmother did was turn all the mice and everything into horses
63-2_1535.312_12.67.wav_ASR	and then then cinderella was going to the ball
63-2_1549.523_20.5.wav_ASR	and then when she got to the ball the only thing the only thing she got to the ball was a glass slipper
63-2_1571.01_3.63.wav_ASR	and they danced the night away
63-2_1575.707_4.89.wav_ASR	and then at twelve o'clock she goes home
63-2_1580.617_5.67.wav_ASR	and while she was going one of her slippers was missing
63-2_1586.306_15.28.wav_ASR	and so when she got home cinderella was back on her own and her shabby clothes and everything
63-2_1601.634_26.69.wav_ASR	and then the the shoe was supposed to be broken by by cinderella
63-2_1629.078_3.66.wav_ASR	but they they
63-2_1632.753_6.42.wav_ASR	and and so cinderella went to the ball
63-2_1639.194_4.61.wav_ASR	shoe and it was the exact match for cinderella other shoe
63-2_1644.445_0.98.wav_ASR	so she knows it
63-2_1646.792_3.37.wav_ASR	and so her prince came along
63-2_1650.177_1.77.wav_ASR	and they lived happily ever after
63-2_1666.397_8.74.wav_ASR	you put one one one you put two slices of bread
63-2_1675.69_2.37.wav_ASR	one peanut butter and one jelly
63-2_1678.161_2.74.wav_ASR	and you get a knife
63-2_1680.917_3.87.wav_ASR	and you got a peanut butter and jelly sandwich
65-1_9.517_0.96.wav_ASR	seen to be addicted
65-1_28.81_2.53.wav_ASR	the eighty fourth installment of five years ago
65-1_35.471_0.49.wav_ASR	well i'll show you
65-1_36.531_2.9.wav_ASR	the happened on a thursday march the first of the year
65-1_40.334_5.76.wav_ASR	remember we're at some friend's house having supper the whole time
65-1_46.238_15.54.wav_ASR	and i remember nothing after that until later on in the middle of july
65-1_63.223_3.95.wav_ASR	and the eighty eighty ninety
65-1_67.496_0.83.wav_ASR	and i see the
65-1_69.041_4.34.wav_ASR	was crossing ten street to get there
65-1_74.421_2.67.wav_ASR	and i remember crossing in the parking lot
65-1_77.109_7.56.wav_ASR	crossing with the light and she's getting up close to the corner pillar on the corner
65-1_86.021_1.74.wav_ASR	and then i had the insurance they stopped me
65-1_87.783_6.82.wav_ASR	and that's the last i remember for probably a lot of years
65-1_104.608_1.57.wav_ASR	the other one
65-1_107.092_0.66.wav_ASR	yeah it was one
65-1_107.8_10.32.wav_ASR	it was very disturbing because really trouble because i don't know
65-1_119.162_6.17.wav_ASR	and there were visitors in the hospital room and everything
65-1_125.543_3.84.wav_ASR	and these guys were saying they didn't want it
65-1_129.431_3.17.wav_ASR	and i knew who they were knew the two of them
65-1_132.616_1.52.wav_ASR	but there's a lot lots of things
65-1_134.184_1.5.wav_ASR	and i didn't know where i was
65-1_136.291_2.12.wav_ASR	there were several people visiting me
65-1_138.802_1.63.wav_ASR	and and there's several animals
65-1_141.127_1.76.wav_ASR	when when is his voice gonna come up
65-1_143.169_1.03.wav_ASR	when is the fireman gonna come in
65-1_145.808_1.58.wav_ASR	and i thought i was perfect
65-1_148.727_11.07.wav_ASR	and but what i didn't know was at the spent ten days with a breathing tube hooked down my throat and everything
65-1_160.403_2.47.wav_ASR	and then look like it wasn't gonna come out right
65-1_162.888_1.7.wav_ASR	and they gave me a tricycle
65-1_165.547_13.33.wav_ASR	and and so the the what turned out to be a saturday and vacation kind of thing
65-1_178.901_7.83.wav_ASR	and she said that the you you
65-1_190.21_0.31.wav_ASR	so i said
65-1_190.701_1.11.wav_ASR	actually there there was a girl
65-1_191.914_1.46.wav_ASR	what's the one thing you like about it
65-1_193.584_0.55.wav_ASR	and that was gone
65-1_194.184_7.67.wav_ASR	that was sort of disturbing because i i like to talk a lot
65-1_202.556_3.45.wav_ASR	when people write it's they recognize the name
65-1_206.835_1.36.wav_ASR	when is when's the wash gonna come up
65-1_208.855_1.99.wav_ASR	and i was really really troubled
65-1_211.097_0.7.wav_ASR	really trouble
65-1_214.441_2.34.wav_ASR	that was one of the first ones
65-1_227.068_4.71.wav_ASR	well it's what what happened to me was that the the stroke
65-1_232.093_9.72.wav_ASR	and terms of my brain injury if you will certain things kinda stand out more than others
65-1_242.008_14.18.wav_ASR	and it just when when i hadta get focused on something i didn't particularly understand or or appreciate of it
65-1_256.236_2.98.wav_ASR	it was an important notice to me
65-1_261.478_2.001.wav_ASR	and didn't never like it
65-1_264.808_2.63.wav_ASR	but just really annoying
65-1_267.486_1.47.wav_ASR	and i kept on saying
65-1_268.978_5.53.wav_ASR	well it was very very dull for a long period of time
65-1_291.425_2.81.wav_ASR	and and i don't want you ever to forget it
65-1_294.408_3.91.wav_ASR	and i wouldn't wish it at all
65-1_316.655_7.65.wav_ASR	the almost ninety nine years ago
65-1_324.396_0.55.wav_ASR	again
65-1_325.376_0.84.wav_ASR	and that's all
65-1_326.232_3.43.wav_ASR	it was like just a rain but not really not raining
65-1_330.55_12.55.wav_ASR	but the eighty first instance it was was most interesting because one of my the computer for me is a word processing system
65-1_343.181_6.64.wav_ASR	what they call the hip hop or police officer listening i don't know what's going on
65-1_349.842_1.58.wav_ASR	he was gonna go right into university
65-1_352.182_4.66.wav_ASR	and and my one of my supervisors said to me
65-1_356.862_0.89.wav_ASR	and he wasn't supposed to do that
65-1_357.802_6.2.wav_ASR	and told me i was on the hip list which meant again i couldn't do anything
65-1_364.136_1.18.wav_ASR	my career's laid out fine
65-1_366.048_2.15.wav_ASR	there was nothing sensible
65-1_369.12_8.58.wav_ASR	and then after the eighty four incident a person came out twenty years later and said
65-1_377.717_1.63.wav_ASR	what do i find out twenty years later is indiana
65-1_380.151_3.17.wav_ASR	and and i cinderella
65-1_384.141_2.67.wav_ASR	well i was slower to comprehend
65-1_387.869_5.87.wav_ASR	but finally did after it taking more time you know
65-1_393.757_7.06.wav_ASR	and and i couldn't do my engineering job to the best of my ability
65-1_401.669_1.51.wav_ASR	and i didn't tell anybody
65-1_403.668_0.89.wav_ASR	well i didn't tell anybody
65-1_404.612_0.8.wav_ASR	what i figured it out
65-1_406.295_17.87.wav_ASR	and i fixed it and spent my lunch hours for months by myself in a conference room listening to my job and not being able to do anything
65-1_424.226_1.26.wav_ASR	that's before before eighty five
65-1_426.413_1.47.wav_ASR	in nineteen eighty one
65-1_428.188_2.09.wav_ASR	actually before the emergency is disney
65-1_430.428_0.54.wav_ASR	wait a minute
65-1_432.046_2.46.wav_ASR	and and i was on the airplane with her
65-1_434.528_1.11.wav_ASR	well i don't know current business
65-1_436.8_5.82.wav_ASR	and i just knew that that not be able to contact aphasia again
65-1_443.288_1.95.wav_ASR	actually i just knew i was gonna get it
65-1_445.562_0.85.wav_ASR	and i knew i was
65-1_447.165_8.14.wav_ASR	had three kids a stepmother and stepdaughters
65-1_455.32_2.19.wav_ASR	and i was the
65-1_458.431_2.45.wav_ASR	and i couldn't stand out thought about it
65-1_461.855_5.49.wav_ASR	and and so i'll say what i'm gonna say is
65-1_467.981_7.74.wav_ASR	and took me probably three years to figure out that i was no longer able to speak
65-1_476.146_1.08.wav_ASR	and no no no
65-1_477.247_2.36.wav_ASR	you took it was wasn't nice
65-1_479.684_3.22.wav_ASR	but i it was no longer a problem
65-1_482.928_9.4.wav_ASR	and and the the biggest most difficult part of that was the short memory loss
65-1_493.261_11.8.wav_ASR	and so i ended up with a franklin laborer and would write down everything in there for me
65-1_506.11_10.319.wav_ASR	so it was a relatively the aphasia and and speech therapist
65-1_516.482_4.701.wav_ASR	and then of course i look back back on it all the time
65-1_521.2_2.859.wav_ASR	and and i did not deserve to be in the same room
65-1_524.107_3.97.wav_ASR	well it it was perfectly obvious that something was wrong
65-1_528.092_0.72.wav_ASR	what was i not interested in
65-1_530.176_14.41.wav_ASR	and that the righting everything down was was the biggest sister cinderella
65-1_567.07_6.54.wav_ASR	the basically it was at the end
65-1_573.891_4.62.wav_ASR	well i i call it forty four to fifty one p m every day
65-1_579.419_5.17.wav_ASR	that's how my my mind works
65-1_585.51_11.37.wav_ASR	and i that that is that is what i call my my defining moment in life
65-1_597.64_8.89.wav_ASR	because i struggled with the the aphasia obviously and memory issues a lot
65-1_606.552_13.22.wav_ASR	and and i mean like for example the the window of seventy six sixty seven was broken
65-1_619.826_1.84.wav_ASR	you had a job in indiana
65-1_621.855_7.67.wav_ASR	and so the education video i i paid rent to my folks for a year
65-1_630.113_6.18.wav_ASR	and that window my dad and i put the old firstnamewave in a shaver video and everything
65-1_637.015_3.44.wav_ASR	and it was quite an interesting interesting time
65-1_641.315_4.08.wav_ASR	and and interestingly enough i had a stroke
65-1_645.41_8.3.wav_ASR	the engine had a rotor four wheelbarge engine in it
65-1_653.791_1.8.wav_ASR	and i could probably still today
65-1_655.869_1.58.wav_ASR	and this is nineteen sixty seven
65-1_658.288_2.76.wav_ASR	well i'd probably tell the fire department to reel it back in
65-1_662.6_3.89.wav_ASR	and but but i'd asked her what i had for supper and she said
65-1_667.122_0.49.wav_ASR	can't tie it
65-1_669.274_0.66.wav_ASR	so yeah
65-1_670.235_1.4.wav_ASR	short short term memory loss
65-1_671.658_13.02.wav_ASR	but then things from from long ago and do do some something long ago i don't know
65-1_695.671_5.07.wav_ASR	now actually i was involved in a lot of things
65-1_701.591_4.64.wav_ASR	and and i got out a school the spring break trip
65-1_706.317_1.95.wav_ASR	at a job it's common to see firstnames
65-1_709.739_0.87.wav_ASR	they're an appartment
65-1_710.687_2.65.wav_ASR	and firstnamesa knows where to go for a long time
65-1_714.262_5.09.wav_ASR	but i was engrossed in college engineering at the time
65-1_720.011_10.31.wav_ASR	and so i my my cousins for who will call it or firstnamel and firstnamet are the two of them
65-1_731.149_9.58.wav_ASR	the fourth one a small four park service had a a cable car to the top of the mountain
65-1_745.046_7.51.wav_ASR	and the firstnamet firstnamee firstnamee firstnamee and firstnamel firstnamee are all good friends
65-1_753.154_4.14.wav_ASR	so i was already doing that kind of stuff as my myself
65-1_758.166_6.91.wav_ASR	but then my my father found this this article on an ingram website
65-1_765.797_12.68.wav_ASR	and it just happened to be that it was a problem for you know while while i was in the hospital
65-1_778.497_8.96.wav_ASR	and and it it just was kind of hard for me to talk
65-1_815.779_2.14.wav_ASR	well it was a real slipper
65-1_818.492_4.39.wav_ASR	meaning that the hospital at the time was the dottson hospital
65-1_823.884_3.99.wav_ASR	it was at the first of the dance
65-1_828.597_6.2.wav_ASR	and and i useta have a spot light in my office
65-1_835.141_6.83.wav_ASR	and they the other guys the the drivers the daisies kids couldn't figure out how to open the door
65-1_842.229_5.21.wav_ASR	it was a lot of fun seeing the faces at it and everything
65-1_910.099_1.2.wav_ASR	oh okay
65-1_911.875_2.36.wav_ASR	the story is there's a a fairy godmother
65-1_914.589_8.46.wav_ASR	looks like maybe maybe seventy eight or seventy five percent of the people in the hospital
65-1_923.492_6.72.wav_ASR	and then an e r kick it's a soccer ball through a a window
65-1_930.915_8.97.wav_ASR	and the soccer ball comes through the house a window and lands on an an adult man sitting in the living room
65-1_940.813_7.32.wav_ASR	and the dude mailman gets up holding the soccer ball and looks out the hole in the window and says
65-1_951.714_0.38.wav_ASR	and i don't
65-1_971.063_5.65.wav_ASR	it looks like a a a young boy is going to school
65-1_976.736_2.88.wav_ASR	and as his mother said
65-1_979.897_1.4.wav_ASR	here's here's your umbrella
65-1_981.983_0.84.wav_ASR	and i said
65-1_983.049_1.03.wav_ASR	uhhuh i don't need it
65-1_984.13_4.77.wav_ASR	and then cinderella leaves saying goodbye
65-1_989.831_1.61.wav_ASR	and the mom holding the umbrella
65-1_991.969_3.23.wav_ASR	and the the young lad is out and about walking around
65-1_995.914_1.2.wav_ASR	and it starts to rain
65-1_997.78_1.36.wav_ASR	and then the surgery happened
65-1_999.75_0.79.wav_ASR	and he's running
65-1_1000.563_4.18.wav_ASR	and he gets back to his mom saying
65-1_1005.358_0.87.wav_ASR	and he's not happy
65-1_1006.245_1.13.wav_ASR	you know it noticed she had a stroke
65-1_1008.212_2.37.wav_ASR	and then he goes outside with it with an umbrella
65-1_1010.631_3.09.wav_ASR	and and it looks like it's going to rain
65-1_1027.309_5.9.wav_ASR	well the beginning it looks like a cat a cat that climbed up the tree
65-1_1034.269_3.46.wav_ASR	and being probably chased by a dog or something
65-1_1038.222_1.16.wav_ASR	got stuck up in the tree
65-1_1040.013_8.761.wav_ASR	the little girl who was probably her owner threw away her tricycle and didn't take it back
65-1_1049.333_10.48.wav_ASR	and looks like an adult female who climbed up the tree to get the cat and is not getting it down
65-1_1060.56_5.52.wav_ASR	also and now then there's also a bird over the side of the window
65-1_1066.533_11.02.wav_ASR	and there's also the local fire department is showing up with their ladder to try to get down both the cat and the man
65-1_1077.577_2.22.wav_ASR	that's that's the treat for me
65-1_1353.355_0.3.wav_ASR	if you think so
65-1_1353.835_5.45.wav_ASR	my sister firstnamel was her mother's name
65-1_1360.127_2.77.wav_ASR	father the rain
65-1_1363.72_8.84.wav_ASR	and there was the wicked stepmother and that brought her two daughters
65-1_1373.655_13.75.wav_ASR	and and in their home life the cinderella's treated poorly by the stepmothers and ugly sisters
65-1_1387.769_7.59.wav_ASR	and and it just worked really well
65-1_1395.968_9.9.wav_ASR	and then in the kingdom the king had a cinderella
65-1_1406.524_19.39.wav_ASR	and one of his employees decided to have a ball to invite all the eligible ladies in the kingdom with the the prince
65-1_1427.134_24.41.wav_ASR	and the and so cinderella with the help of the mice and they went up a a really lovely gown for cinderella to go to the ball
65-1_1451.694_17.08.wav_ASR	and and the stepdaughters married one of her daughters married one of her daughters
65-1_1469.504_3.98.wav_ASR	her stepsisters
65-1_1474.182_11.98.wav_ASR	and and a a pumpkin was look like a a pumpkin and then mice went in to help with it
65-1_1486.874_8.89.wav_ASR	and i think the the horse from the house ended up as the the driver of the the carriage
65-1_1496.594_3.35.wav_ASR	and she she had a gown of her own
65-1_1499.966_5.76.wav_ASR	also the the prince danced a night away with cinderella
65-1_1506.4_12.64.wav_ASR	and the stepmother from from cinderella's father was he hadta be back by midnight because everything would go away
65-1_1519.217_1.04.wav_ASR	so it was
65-1_1520.273_3.71.wav_ASR	so she heard out of there and left a glass slipper
65-1_1524.602_11.17.wav_ASR	and then after the the ball was over the the the prince is going to find cinderella
65-1_1535.789_2.93.wav_ASR	and it was the glove that left the glass slipper in her hand
65-1_1538.769_9.72.wav_ASR	and and so the firemen were sent out the kingdom to try and figure out who was the cinderella
65-1_1549.451_11.43.wav_ASR	and it was the the lady who's who fit fit this slipper is cinderella
65-1_1561.723_3.47.wav_ASR	and the stepsisters neither one of them fit the slipper
65-1_1565.701_3.72.wav_ASR	the cinderella's foot would be too big
65-1_1569.443_7.35.wav_ASR	and so she was invited as the one that the prince wanted to want to marry
65-1_1576.915_5.67.wav_ASR	and and so then the the the prince said
65-1_1582.609_2.0.wav_ASR	and they live happily ever after
65-1_1595.381_4.76.wav_ASR	pretty probably on a monday
65-1_1600.8_8.05.wav_ASR	you would use a knife and and spread the peanut butter on one side of the bread
65-1_1609.79_6.11.wav_ASR	but then the other other bread the other other bread peanut butter and jelly sandwich
65-1_1617.339_1.5.wav_ASR	and then she take a spoon
65-1_1619.081_5.76.wav_ASR	now not nice because you cut up the the jelly and all that
65-1_1624.893_6.9.wav_ASR	but you take your spoon and and spread out the the the grape jelly on the bread
65-1_1632.163_2.41.wav_ASR	used that knife spread the peanut butter and jelly
65-1_1634.597_2.32.wav_ASR	and then then put the two halves together
65-1_1636.935_3.5.wav_ASR	and you got the alphabet peanut butter and jelly
65-2_8.167_1.85.wav_ASR	spreads peanut butter
65-2_10.563_0.77.wav_ASR	much improvement
65-2_12.338_9.08.wav_ASR	the the holling of the speech therapy for words is really good
65-2_22.185_23.08.wav_ASR	the what happens is that the if i have an idea to tell a story or something like that i will maybe do it and in in another time
65-2_45.514_1.3.wav_ASR	and i should have said something
65-2_46.935_0.67.wav_ASR	could i sit at the table
65-2_48.111_1.09.wav_ASR	why why didn't i say it
65-2_49.95_6.53.wav_ASR	apartment in the trouble shooting an operating room if there's some bleeding or something
65-2_57.16_5.08.wav_ASR	it helps amazingly if i think about it for about an hour
65-2_62.323_26.47.wav_ASR	and then in in the afternoon or the the length of time spent analyzing and thinking about it and considering the different aspects of the problem technically at that time is the best thing to do
65-2_89.557_8.62.wav_ASR	and it it is
65-2_98.79_1.57.wav_ASR	why didn't i think to that before
65-2_100.765_5.64.wav_ASR	if before my eightyfourth birthday i was able to drive
65-2_107.061_5.26.wav_ASR	but it's much more difficult and and takes a lot of time
65-2_112.37_1.84.wav_ASR	and that's it
65-2_114.233_1.4.wav_ASR	and then that week for thirty six years
65-2_127.18_6.21.wav_ASR	the first one was a tibetan monk
65-2_134.294_2.7.wav_ASR	and and it ended up
65-2_137.011_6.39.wav_ASR	and i i caught the an old english history book and started reading it
65-2_144.01_12.54.wav_ASR	and had a chihuahua barking up the tree
65-2_157.19_1.61.wav_ASR	did i say pumpkin logan
65-2_159.526_1.7.wav_ASR	seventy years ago a woman
65-2_161.937_1.51.wav_ASR	the third one was in colorado springs
65-2_164.72_6.62.wav_ASR	and and i in a college there was a professor
65-2_172.132_7.28.wav_ASR	hospital probably probably a week or two
65-2_180.19_6.53.wav_ASR	and our third child was born three days after i was in the hospital
65-2_190.003_8.12.wav_ASR	and the second one was february nineteen ninety four
65-2_199.113_2.48.wav_ASR	it was a sherry vitrioli on the left side
65-2_202.563_6.32.wav_ASR	and and i i believe that i was in the hospital
65-2_209.678_1.66.wav_ASR	well i i guess i don't know how to say it
65-2_212.237_10.04.wav_ASR	but i recall walking across the street starting across and seeing the firemen coming
65-2_223.056_2.51.wav_ASR	and then i had the session being spooned in my head
65-2_226.386_7.17.wav_ASR	and then later like i say i i i don't know what's going on
65-2_234.386_0.46.wav_ASR	and i don't know
65-2_234.865_0.96.wav_ASR	twenty minutes later
65-2_236.459_2.59.wav_ASR	and and i i was in the hospital
65-2_239.878_5.52.wav_ASR	well i was in a wonderful place because the eighty four event last year was five thousand people
65-2_246.349_7.14.wav_ASR	and and this one february twenty nineteen i know exactly what was going on
65-2_254.174_2.51.wav_ASR	and i was in a relationship
65-2_257.551_13.19.wav_ASR	and then i say a a brain injury because i think it was about one day or two later in the hospital
65-2_271.809_19.88.wav_ASR	and that was the most extensive pain in the leg from that the the not knowing if the damage would ever go away or not
65-2_292.55_3.94.wav_ASR	it did finally go away when the brain stroke happened
65-2_296.863_0.66.wav_ASR	finally we went
65-2_297.627_3.16.wav_ASR	but i recall maybe three or four days
65-2_303.117_1.68.wav_ASR	the last i noticed about it
65-2_305.602_7.65.wav_ASR	and and the doctors could not tell me whether the the disease was in my brain
65-2_313.306_5.33.wav_ASR	it was an interesting story
65-2_318.652_8.33.wav_ASR	and i recall that the orthopedic guy that stuck a pin in my neck and said
65-2_327.006_12.71.wav_ASR	well after three or four months when the all the firesmen and the firemen came in
65-2_340.67_4.18.wav_ASR	oh boy you know that's probably the most painful one for me
65-2_345.576_0.85.wav_ASR	oh okay
65-2_346.527_1.96.wav_ASR	yeah well what's just me being a big baby now
65-2_349.558_1.88.wav_ASR	and then you take the jelly
65-2_353.552_2.83.wav_ASR	that's kind of a
65-2_356.478_4.01.wav_ASR	that's the two accidents in it and at at at at another time
65-2_372.985_7.65.wav_ASR	oh westminster going to austin and denver
65-2_399.4_12.1.wav_ASR	the after the first eighty four individuals i was able to speak
65-2_411.553_17.22.wav_ASR	what what happened was at the eighty four lap was first i think it was
65-2_429.508_17.32.wav_ASR	and and my my boss at that time i cinderella hadta run away
65-2_447.04_0.75.wav_ASR	oh i'll call it you know
65-2_449.397_1.27.wav_ASR	well let's say we're playing a game
65-2_450.939_2.51.wav_ASR	but to learn how to use there are some rules
65-2_454.232_6.24.wav_ASR	and of course this is before the midnight eighty four and midnight twelve
65-2_460.758_11.03.wav_ASR	and i've been doing a nasal strain which is nasal surgery for the common cold and stuff like that
65-2_472.499_9.05.wav_ASR	and but that was all on firstnamel a punch card and that kind of stuff
65-2_482.344_4.62.wav_ASR	and and so here's a a slice of bread
65-2_486.979_1.14.wav_ASR	well i don't know how to do it
65-2_488.329_4.44.wav_ASR	and and so they brought this my boss brought me to the hospital
65-2_492.784_4.6.wav_ASR	and in those years there was a a university of maryland
65-2_498.448_4.81.wav_ASR	and it tried to use a computer program for me
65-2_503.994_7.47.wav_ASR	if you're ready for a microphone of any kind they are extremely good
65-2_512.342_14.661.wav_ASR	and one of the one thing in particular which was probably more complicated when the and the man came home
65-2_528.184_0.51.wav_ASR	select
65-2_528.839_12.43.wav_ASR	well have you ever had any training in in a a laboratory or microbiology lab
65-2_542.262_6.07.wav_ASR	and and after several days of trying to figure out what sedate me i said
65-2_548.888_1.04.wav_ASR	there was a hospital
65-2_550.399_0.6.wav_ASR	it's like me
65-2_551.438_0.49.wav_ASR	aphasia
65-2_552.509_5.58.wav_ASR	slow meant what they meant by slow i could understand
65-2_558.551_0.56.wav_ASR	it couldn't
65-2_559.312_1.04.wav_ASR	there was no way
65-2_560.944_2.31.wav_ASR	and i'm already trouble really tired
65-2_564.422_5.97.wav_ASR	and so finally i called a coworker and said
65-2_570.608_3.88.wav_ASR	what what does this mean when they say
65-2_575.568_7.44.wav_ASR	and it destroyed the heart attack and moving the car all over the place
65-2_583.899_1.23.wav_ASR	that's what they met by suicide
65-2_585.777_2.95.wav_ASR	well hi hello that was never described in the manual you know
65-2_589.857_3.86.wav_ASR	and that that that really that threw me for a loop
65-2_594.838_7.3.wav_ASR	and so they came very quickly as to worry whether i could go to the dance or not
65-2_603.43_5.21.wav_ASR	and so finally the they say
65-2_609.025_0.57.wav_ASR	oh okay
65-2_609.645_8.98.wav_ASR	there was most basic terms which the the the
65-2_619.047_2.1.wav_ASR	but i know there's this dog that's barking
65-2_621.166_1.3.wav_ASR	it was before michael jackson existed
65-2_623.365_14.01.wav_ASR	as a firstnamem it did not not concern the somebody would have the the goal and therapy and everything else
65-2_638.605_1.01.wav_ASR	they did not
65-2_640.35_2.3.wav_ASR	doze made it not decide that anything
65-2_643.738_14.19.wav_ASR	and so i went back to work and struggling with the aphasia and short term memory issues and all that stuff
65-2_658.457_15.64.wav_ASR	and and finally my i after a couple years the computer brought out a what to call the franklin plan or something like that
65-2_675.07_5.2.wav_ASR	you might hafta take the peanut butter and then a little bit of jelly
65-2_681.229_2.47.wav_ASR	and so well that was the way it was
65-2_684.72_2.15.wav_ASR	and i mean just be able to the right right there
65-2_686.892_1.67.wav_ASR	so i i carry an umbrella
65-2_689.233_0.96.wav_ASR	how do you write right now
65-2_690.968_8.11.wav_ASR	still i carry a small knife knife not not knife but
65-2_699.671_10.58.wav_ASR	because that that was writing when i figured out it when my my boss fired me
65-2_710.85_7.47.wav_ASR	all the macarons that was that was a new year's day
65-2_719.266_2.66.wav_ASR	that that doesn't make sense
65-2_721.95_17.32.wav_ASR	and also i ended up as a lawyer as a attorney for the company in the defense protection law firm
65-2_739.905_10.88.wav_ASR	when i meet somebody new i will always say their name over and over and over again
65-2_751.358_5.4.wav_ASR	used their name in any kind of vehicle
65-2_757.276_2.99.wav_ASR	usually every time firstnamer and firstnamee are there
65-2_760.315_4.68.wav_ASR	and and then after the conversation i said
65-2_766.354_8.45.wav_ASR	and and that that's a a very difficult drive that i have
65-2_775.921_2.94.wav_ASR	for example i met a woman in her neighborhood
65-2_779.492_1.18.wav_ASR	and i'm i'm at home now
65-2_781.203_0.98.wav_ASR	knocked down the fireman
65-2_782.926_11.55.wav_ASR	and met a fellow in the neighborhood out for a walk of several days ago and talking to him
65-2_794.526_1.25.wav_ASR	and i got it in my head
65-2_795.797_6.87.wav_ASR	and then said his name over and down and the like and told my wife about it and then i said
65-2_803.378_7.6.wav_ASR	and this morning i saw him out for a walk and couldn't recall his name at first but then came back to me
65-2_810.996_1.51.wav_ASR	and then finally finally came back
65-2_813.742_14.39.wav_ASR	so but the the discipline on on reviewing news is quite quite quite an important to me
65-2_839.375_0.52.wav_ASR	yes
65-2_840.697_4.78.wav_ASR	the i think i mentioned to you before
65-2_846.085_1.32.wav_ASR	maybe it's not positive
65-2_847.746_4.92.wav_ASR	five times a day i spent some time at the rehab facility in new jersey
65-2_853.54_6.13.wav_ASR	and because i started off four years after the eighty year old
65-2_860.446_8.79.wav_ASR	and it became rather troubling to me because they just didn't do therapy for me
65-2_869.993_1.69.wav_ASR	so there's another one
65-2_871.699_1.97.wav_ASR	you just eat a lot of food
65-2_873.684_3.67.wav_ASR	if you're able to just get a doctor's visit with me
65-2_878.184_5.53.wav_ASR	and because they just didn't do therapy for me
65-2_883.737_16.3.wav_ASR	and and of course the next few years a wife and i found out about from people that had had therapy for the stroke
65-2_901.056_3.61.wav_ASR	and the suicide rate is four to five times higher than usual
65-2_905.719_4.72.wav_ASR	that was what they're telling people even you know
65-2_911.291_15.93.wav_ASR	and so i wanted to share that with patients at alzheimer's or just to give them hope that they could get them home that way
65-2_928.404_1.38.wav_ASR	it used to take a long time
65-2_930.61_10.94.wav_ASR	and in miami when i started there at arizona it was i heard nurses telling me to go to the bathroom
65-2_942.297_1.58.wav_ASR	four a year and a half ago
65-2_944.156_1.01.wav_ASR	here are a few examples
65-2_945.302_0.94.wav_ASR	here to hear every conversation
65-2_947.407_3.51.wav_ASR	hey you don't stop talking
65-2_950.937_7.04.wav_ASR	the rate maybe amitriptych if you will and slow down progressively after a few days
65-2_958.775_1.9.wav_ASR	you never never stopped recovering
65-2_961.454_7.72.wav_ASR	in the eightyies i had a dead spot with no feeling at all
65-2_970.136_2.65.wav_ASR	and there was just something that i liked
65-2_972.842_1.73.wav_ASR	and there was a bunch of books
65-2_974.655_0.98.wav_ASR	you know no big deal
65-2_975.956_3.16.wav_ASR	to stick a peanut butter there and wouldn't wouldn't spread it
65-2_979.96_1.4.wav_ASR	oh no big deal
65-2_981.865_4.86.wav_ASR	and then it was probably five years ago in the beginning of january
65-2_987.413_0.4.wav_ASR	thank you
65-2_987.879_0.74.wav_ASR	and i think he was alone
65-2_989.309_5.7.wav_ASR	twenty five years after the eighty fourth incident i was in the bedroom putting my socks on
65-2_996.424_4.47.wav_ASR	and i had feeling in the spot that had no feeling at all
65-2_1002.063_12.36.wav_ASR	so what i'm telling you actually is that the recovery may slow down like it did in the beginning
65-2_1014.632_2.9.wav_ASR	that's still it never actually happened
65-2_1017.689_1.16.wav_ASR	you just don't forget about it
65-2_1019.52_6.059.wav_ASR	well i'm not sure what's going on
65-2_1068.805_3.42.wav_ASR	yes it's not not now
65-2_1072.242_7.48.wav_ASR	it's it time is the best you're firstnamet and firstnamej are the best in the world

65-2_1088.535_2.52.wav_ASR	and and you'll notice one day i'll say
65-2_1091.749_2.26.wav_ASR	crash i i fell in there and didn't know how to get up

65-2_1108.416_2.63.wav_ASR	actually i don't know
65-2_1111.095_6.75.wav_ASR	it was it just i mean i was used to a little bit of speech therapy
65-2_1118.126_4.87.wav_ASR	that that i don't know if i got useful or or not
65-2_1124.138_3.5.wav_ASR	but like i said twenty five years later just put on the socks and everything
65-2_1128.17_0.83.wav_ASR	wait wait a minute

65-2_1301.09_1.27.wav_ASR	wait a down about three years ago
65-2_1303.312_4.59.wav_ASR	and after about four years i figured out that well maybe it was
65-2_1307.917_1.44.wav_ASR	and i'll get more serious about it
65-2_1310.334_6.28.wav_ASR	so it was just i i assumed her of picking me up at an airport or something
65-2_1317.648_2.02.wav_ASR	that's where we were first met and she picked me up
65-2_1359.514_5.59.wav_ASR	and a young boy is looking for a a girl to marry
65-2_1365.124_0.54.wav_ASR	what's your name
65-2_1366.388_2.61.wav_ASR	he it ends up going to the hospital
65-2_1369.723_9.4.wav_ASR	and a gentleman on a couch there in the window is sitting right by where the soccer ball comes through and hits the window
65-2_1379.989_6.19.wav_ASR	and then he he gets the ball stays by the broken window trying to find out just to what happened
65-2_1402.182_12.63.wav_ASR	and the beginning this this mother it appears has a umbrella and wanted to give it to her son who is going to school
65-2_1415.551_2.24.wav_ASR	and i said
65-2_1418.288_0.93.wav_ASR	and she says no and i says
65-2_1419.62_0.77.wav_ASR	uhhuh no mom i don't know
65-2_1421.306_1.08.wav_ASR	and then firstnamel said
65-2_1422.451_2.41.wav_ASR	and then in the middle it started raining a lot
65-2_1425.438_1.43.wav_ASR	and then rain heavier on him
65-2_1426.933_7.19.wav_ASR	and then and then he goes back home just as soaked to the bone with his mother inlaw
65-2_1434.453_6.25.wav_ASR	and then the last the story was he learned his lesson and has the umbrella with him again
65-2_1455.01_13.73.wav_ASR	the way this started was that at the base of the tree a dog is barking
65-2_1469.12_2.18.wav_ASR	the dog is barking at the man
65-2_1471.974_7.79.wav_ASR	and on the tree limb there's a cat with a girl down at the tree
65-2_1480.206_6.04.wav_ASR	and it would appear that a cat got in the tree
65-2_1487.152_3.15.wav_ASR	the the little girl's cat climbed up the tree and got stuck in the tree
65-2_1491.016_10.21.wav_ASR	they they a male a was either being chased up the tree by the dog or climbed the tree to get the cat down
65-2_1501.878_3.4.wav_ASR	there's also a firetruck and a firemen
65-2_1506.838_1.32.wav_ASR	the firemen are carrying a ladder
65-2_1508.684_7.57.wav_ASR	and looks like the the ladder is being used by the firemen to the rescue either the man or the cat
65-2_1517.004_11.24.wav_ASR	and and a songbird is over in a a room just singing away just enjoying herself
65-2_1528.296_3.07.wav_ASR	what's your name
65-2_1754.983_9.4.wav_ASR	and cinderella was a the daughter of a stepmother and two stepsisters
65-2_1764.522_2.45.wav_ASR	her mother had passed away
65-2_1767.818_1.36.wav_ASR	and father remarried
65-2_1769.925_8.29.wav_ASR	and the stepmother had two daughters
65-2_1778.914_21.3.wav_ASR	and as they after they were married the stepmother put cinderella a job around the house where she hadta do all the work
65-2_1801.139_8.38.wav_ASR	and so so cinderella spent her time working cleaning and all that kind of stuff
65-2_1810.138_10.22.wav_ASR	and and in that in the kingdom there was a a fairy godmother
65-2_1821.196_18.68.wav_ASR	and an engineer to the king decided a a ball be held with the the prince and cinderella
65-2_1840.902_3.19.wav_ASR	so the word was put out about the ball
65-2_1844.858_6.3.wav_ASR	and cinderella was really happy about the ball coming coming up as well as the dance
65-2_1851.712_16.43.wav_ASR	and so the the firemen firemen mice mice mice make a dress for cinderella
65-2_1868.918_10.26.wav_ASR	and and then at the last minute the stepmother told cinderella that she was going to go
65-2_1879.2_8.54.wav_ASR	and and also the the stepdaughters were were really nice to her
65-2_1888.574_2.81.wav_ASR	and so the stepdaughters went to the ball
65-2_1892.097_14.38.wav_ASR	and but in the meantime well before the ball it was a cinderella's fairy godmother showed up and said
65-2_1906.5_5.6.wav_ASR	and so it it made for her a just a little bit more
65-2_1912.863_16.73.wav_ASR	and they turned a pumpkin into a coach pulled by my mice i believe that were horses and everything
65-2_1930.594_4.29.wav_ASR	and so then she ran out of there
65-2_1935.637_15.69.wav_ASR	and the prince was invited with the stepdaughters and everybody around the town
65-2_1951.795_2.29.wav_ASR	and then spending the next day with the same person
65-2_1954.409_7.13.wav_ASR	the her godmother told cinderella that that he hafta be home by midnight because this this is a very important time
65-2_1962.363_5.08.wav_ASR	and so the the prince and cinderella were dancing and everything
65-2_1967.926_1.87.wav_ASR	and then cinderella said
65-2_1970.219_0.31.wav_ASR	oh no
65-2_1970.547_6.69.wav_ASR	and it runs runs out of the run out of the place leaving a glass slipper behind
65-2_1978.161_9.82.wav_ASR	and and as she's been driving back home the the
65-2_1988.0_2.49.wav_ASR	and the horse turned back into a pumpkin
65-2_1990.617_5.26.wav_ASR	and the firemen came back in the horse and cinderella
65-2_1996.13_0.56.wav_ASR	remember what happened
65-2_1997.231_3.15.wav_ASR	and then so but still it was a problem
65-2_2000.401_10.91.wav_ASR	and and then after the ball the prince decided that there was only one of the two daughters
65-2_2012.653_3.04.wav_ASR	so nobody knew whose identity was could not be found
65-2_2016.419_10.69.wav_ASR	and so he he put his eyes out to the top of the ladder to look at cinderella with the glass slipper
65-2_2027.888_3.08.wav_ASR	and came to cinderella's house
65-2_2031.017_3.76.wav_ASR	the they slipper didn't fit the the slipper
65-2_2035.46_4.69.wav_ASR	and then but turned out it did fit
65-2_2041.079_9.609.wav_ASR	and so it ended up being that cinderella and the prince got married

UCL02a_6.639_0.36.wav_ASR	uhhuh
UCL02a_11.585_0.35.wav_ASR	uhhuh
UCL02a_13.404_4.57.wav_ASR	so just talk about my speech and how it is today to me
UCL02a_18.68_2.04.wav_ASR	well what could be today all with the pen and paper
UCL02a_25.837_2.86.wav_ASR	my speech and this told me a lot
UCL02a_31.699_1.62.wav_ASR	and i don't know
UCL02a_34.593_2.69.wav_ASR	well maybe you can help me
UCL02a_37.33_2.09.wav_ASR	so sometimes he's pretty good this morning but
UCL02a_39.439_0.94.wav_ASR	that's the way it goes
UCL02a_40.4_0.93.wav_ASR	it's really isn't today
UCL02a_43.429_1.1.wav_ASR	speaking you can be good
UCL02a_44.544_1.86.wav_ASR	sometimes i can't understand
UCL02a_47.789_2.6.wav_ASR	it's not hearing what's happening about it
UCL02a_50.411_1.47.wav_ASR	can't
UCL02a_53.073_3.41.wav_ASR	you know the same thing to me the big problem is sunny one winter
UCL02a_56.5_1.63.wav_ASR	you know that that dad
UCL02a_58.449_1.89.wav_ASR	because i just talking at that now i can't do it
UCL02a_61.489_4.3.wav_ASR	one week i think i can hear about a mile
UCL02a_66.983_3.54.wav_ASR	and i can hear everything
UCL02a_70.775_5.62.wav_ASR	and then suddenly it just dissolves away
UCL02a_77.532_0.76.wav_ASR	it's hard to tell
UCL02a_78.308_2.25.wav_ASR	sometimes one day you can be positive
UCL02a_81.517_1.77.wav_ASR	well not perfect i mean it is difficult
UCL02a_83.309_5.47.wav_ASR	and then sometimes it's i just kind of don't know what's going on
UCL02a_88.8_1.82.wav_ASR	that's a difficult thing when with the speech
UCL02a_92.492_4.69.wav_ASR	and then once upon a time it's beautiful
UCL02a_97.24_3.13.wav_ASR	and then of course one word is just disturbing for me
UCL02a_100.812_1.34.wav_ASR	from what point you can't remember
UCL02a_102.173_0.54.wav_ASR	that's okay
UCL02a_103.893_3.39.wav_ASR	and then suddenly one word is pretty easy for speaking to people
UCL02a_107.33_0.65.wav_ASR	it's good for me
UCL02a_108.7_2.11.wav_ASR	and then suddenly just make me so happy
UCL02a_111.006_1.62.wav_ASR	well not tired but then i just kinda
UCL02a_112.82_1.55.wav_ASR	he's difficult to tell you
UCL02a_115.317_8.88.wav_ASR	yeah i don't know
UCL02a_124.218_1.15.wav_ASR	so i don't think about it much
UCL02a_125.597_8.35.wav_ASR	and i try many times about to get better
UCL02a_134.03_3.34.wav_ASR	sometimes it's good
UCL02a_137.419_4.91.wav_ASR	when people were talking to me and then i guess they talk to me a lot
UCL02a_142.345_3.14.wav_ASR	and i think maybe one little word is is disapproved of me
UCL02a_146.052_0.98.wav_ASR	one word is just gone
UCL02a_147.699_2.65.wav_ASR	and then sometimes it me just terrible when i can't hear anything
UCL02a_151.038_4.42.wav_ASR	it's hard for me to say it
UCL02a_155.949_12.23.wav_ASR	sometimes the bad thing is sometimes it's hard for me to talk
UCL02a_168.2_1.91.wav_ASR	that's that's bit bad and making people feel bad
UCL02a_171.11_1.02.wav_ASR	it's very difficult for me
UCL02a_172.344_1.12.wav_ASR	it's very difficult sometimes
UCL02a_173.565_1.16.wav_ASR	and when you're really bad over there
UCL02a_175.216_2.16.wav_ASR	you gotta speak to my dad
UCL02a_177.398_0.78.wav_ASR	it's hard to me
UCL02a_178.199_1.64.wav_ASR	that's very difficult for somebody to say
UCL02a_180.635_5.7.wav_ASR	and you get rinsing the peanut butter
UCL02a_186.35_0.66.wav_ASR	and i'm sitting there
UCL02a_187.33_0.32.wav_ASR	are you sure
UCL02a_188.404_3.4.wav_ASR	well that can be terrible at times
UCL02a_192.01_4.9.wav_ASR	sometimes good sometimes bad
UCL02a_198.705_2.08.wav_ASR	don't forget about speech therapy
UCL02a_200.83_1.55.wav_ASR	so sometimes i'd know reading books
UCL02a_202.4_2.79.wav_ASR	so i useta read things you know before i did my stroke
UCL02a_205.21_1.04.wav_ASR	but i read a lot of books
UCL02a_206.693_3.1.wav_ASR	now is different for me is when i speak but my voice is different
UCL02a_210.781_7.56.wav_ASR	and the old thing for me sometimes i'm reading some my books about two pages in a row
UCL02a_218.619_3.13.wav_ASR	the half the pages are reading about it
UCL02a_222.2_2.17.wav_ASR	good yes that's pretty well i'm reading about it
UCL02a_224.65_1.38.wav_ASR	and then suddenly one brain came out
UCL02a_226.05_0.43.wav_ASR	he just gone
UCL02a_226.69_0.88.wav_ASR	it was terrible as well
UCL02a_228.468_4.2.wav_ASR	so many times when i'm talking again and i can't remember what i said
UCL02a_232.729_1.01.wav_ASR	well it's terrible you know
UCL02a_234.485_8.7.wav_ASR	yeah you know i'm trying to make sense of what's going on
UCL02a_243.916_13.13.wav_ASR	well watching films or dee vee dee vee sometimes i hafta think about what's going on
UCL02a_258.261_9.22.wav_ASR	that's hasta be is well saturday and i i the devils and the the people are gonna be there
UCL02a_268.09_0.94.wav_ASR	so the things are alright
UCL02a_269.046_0.67.wav_ASR	that's quite good
UCL02a_270.468_3.7.wav_ASR	because i don't know what they're talking about with that little girl
UCL02a_274.691_5.27.wav_ASR	students are really good for me when i was a student
UCL02a_282.717_3.23.wav_ASR	and then of course what happened to me with my stroke
UCL02a_285.97_2.58.wav_ASR	well of course you know i did a lot with cognitive stuff
UCL02a_288.565_1.94.wav_ASR	that was the conference i guess
UCL02a_292.355_5.18.wav_ASR	that's the all the social security benefits
UCL02a_297.553_2.03.wav_ASR	so i was living in germany and speaking english
UCL02a_299.599_4.57.wav_ASR	that was one of the things i was doing as the manager of a restaurant
UCL02a_305.791_4.38.wav_ASR	at least my my college music is there too
UCL02a_311.267_2.23.wav_ASR	it was strange to me that happened to me
UCL02a_314.212_3.28.wav_ASR	and i can hear the words partially
UCL02a_317.508_1.67.wav_ASR	all the sound of the music is gone
UCL02a_319.2_1.21.wav_ASR	can i hear everything perfectly
UCL02a_320.824_0.96.wav_ASR	and then somebody said
UCL02a_322.053_0.66.wav_ASR	yes yes that's it
UCL02a_323.079_2.0.wav_ASR	well i i can hear that music
UCL02a_325.1_0.75.wav_ASR	can i hear this well
UCL02a_326.28_0.58.wav_ASR	but i can't say it
UCL02a_327.06_3.92.wav_ASR	that was a bit of like you know see it better in the hospital
UCL02a_331.0_0.95.wav_ASR	oh i can see what that is
UCL02a_332.315_0.63.wav_ASR	and then suddenly
UCL02a_333.511_1.24.wav_ASR	yeah what was that big one
UCL02a_334.876_1.23.wav_ASR	it was the peanut butter
UCL02a_336.218_1.82.wav_ASR	that's funny one word is just gone for me
UCL02a_339.028_2.35.wav_ASR	you hafta get a pencil out
UCL02a_341.4_0.32.wav_ASR	okay
UCL02a_341.803_0.93.wav_ASR	now what is his name
UCL02a_342.829_1.91.wav_ASR	you know i can remember the word up here
UCL02a_344.964_0.93.wav_ASR	can't hear all of it
UCL02a_347.417_4.47.wav_ASR	but the classical music is well thank you for that
UCL02a_351.907_3.12.wav_ASR	and i mean thanksgiving there is well as usual
UCL02a_355.5_1.15.wav_ASR	well singing just now
UCL02a_357.482_1.78.wav_ASR	and i'm reading the books can be difficult for me
UCL02a_360.193_2.99.wav_ASR	the flames i need the soldiers
UCL02a_363.263_3.04.wav_ASR	but then with the music it's pretty much gone now
UCL02a_367.126_5.98.wav_ASR	many things have happened with me in my career and things like that
UCL02a_373.127_1.85.wav_ASR	and i mean it was a big move for me
UCL02a_374.999_1.1.wav_ASR	well that helps people a lot
UCL02a_376.116_0.31.wav_ASR	uhhuh
UCL02a_376.48_0.38.wav_ASR	and i said
UCL02a_377.882_5.1.wav_ASR	what's her name
UCL02a_383.006_1.68.wav_ASR	it's just not enough things as well you know
UCL02a_384.93_2.72.wav_ASR	there's some little things but i don't know
UCL02a_388.125_1.06.wav_ASR	yes but it
UCL02a_394.094_1.97.wav_ASR	that happened on the first day at work
UCL02a_397.44_1.06.wav_ASR	what happened
UCL02a_399.855_1.57.wav_ASR	well that was in the office
UCL02a_402.334_3.75.wav_ASR	well the is the twenty year the fifty one
UCL02a_407.543_0.84.wav_ASR	twelve the fifteenth
UCL02a_408.4_1.08.wav_ASR	yeah it's making sense to me
UCL02a_409.58_2.56.wav_ASR	that was the first one before four years ago
UCL02a_414.5_2.34.wav_ASR	yes i suppose the what i really remember is the stroke
UCL02a_416.862_0.77.wav_ASR	and he was in the eye
UCL02a_417.65_1.01.wav_ASR	and i got to work
UCL02a_419.58_2.06.wav_ASR	and it's about ninety in the morning
UCL02a_422.308_1.74.wav_ASR	off the tip is in the jelly
UCL02a_424.068_1.71.wav_ASR	and then i was gonna cut my bus
UCL02a_427.382_1.25.wav_ASR	and i got there to work
UCL02a_429.05_1.69.wav_ASR	and i remember it was really strange
UCL02a_432.378_3.07.wav_ASR	and i'm gonna go onto my computer
UCL02a_436.506_0.97.wav_ASR	and then suddenly
UCL02a_437.5_2.4.wav_ASR	that's just i'm gonna switch my computer to a different one
UCL02a_440.439_4.99.wav_ASR	and i could remember what is happened to me
UCL02a_445.929_3.87.wav_ASR	well my my code you know you're very good
UCL02a_450.603_0.68.wav_ASR	can you remember where it is
UCL02a_451.3_1.04.wav_ASR	close it up
UCL02a_452.404_0.36.wav_ASR	so she told me
UCL02a_454.288_1.27.wav_ASR	the last one my college
UCL02a_455.628_0.46.wav_ASR	and i said
UCL02a_456.246_7.3.wav_ASR	my husband and i we don't remember how to use my computer at all
UCL02a_464.158_1.26.wav_ASR	and then she suddenly disappeared
UCL02a_465.465_2.41.wav_ASR	and she said to me i wasn't a bit strange to me at all
UCL02a_468.953_0.57.wav_ASR	that's the mother of godmother
UCL02a_470.161_1.38.wav_ASR	okay the dead dead
UCL02a_471.8_0.6.wav_ASR	when i thought of it
UCL02a_474.207_0.79.wav_ASR	it was fine for me
UCL02a_475.017_1.76.wav_ASR	and walking around and things like that
UCL02a_476.8_2.11.wav_ASR	but still my brain is
UCL02a_480.117_4.99.wav_ASR	well i just couldn't remember what computer was and going downstairs and things like that
UCL02a_485.795_3.66.wav_ASR	and suddenly some friends were talking to me and they said
UCL02a_489.477_2.9.wav_ASR	and i couldn't what they were doing
UCL02a_494.892_2.06.wav_ASR	and then a friend of mine firstnamel and i said
UCL02a_497.05_1.56.wav_ASR	oh yeah i'm not sure what's up with this
UCL02a_499.0_1.51.wav_ASR	and she called me
UCL02a_501.025_2.43.wav_ASR	yes about nine o'clock in the morning
UCL02a_503.787_2.13.wav_ASR	we'll take him up to the hospital a man
UCL02a_507.338_1.89.wav_ASR	and i sat there for a couple of times and said
UCL02a_509.25_2.01.wav_ASR	and then they cleaning from me for about a week
UCL02a_512.02_0.421.wav_ASR	and i sat down
UCL02a_512.456_1.29.wav_ASR	well one guy is talking
UCL02a_513.77_1.31.wav_ASR	and there's another people in the room
UCL02a_516.39_1.49.wav_ASR	and then the military you know go to war
UCL02a_517.899_1.26.wav_ASR	and then i couldn't speak to her at all
UCL02a_519.178_1.81.wav_ASR	yes it's a big blob blob blob
UCL02a_522.583_7.091.wav_ASR	you know in hospital there are all these kind of scanning and stuff like that
UCL02a_530.449_1.74.wav_ASR	and i couldn't speak anymore
UCL02a_533.17_0.79.wav_ASR	and i couldn't speak
UCL02a_534.844_2.64.wav_ASR	when people were talking to me i couldn't what they were talking about
UCL02a_537.5_1.32.wav_ASR	okay one word yes
UCL02a_539.744_1.17.wav_ASR	nothing was going on
UCL02a_542.169_5.25.wav_ASR	what's her name
UCL02a_547.468_1.91.wav_ASR	and most of those ten in the middle of the day
UCL02a_549.43_5.87.wav_ASR	so then yeah it the north north miami beach
UCL02a_555.32_1.53.wav_ASR	and then i said afterward that was fine
UCL02a_557.638_2.43.wav_ASR	and it was five or six days away
UCL02a_560.666_2.74.wav_ASR	and they moved me from there to useta
UCL02a_564.353_1.74.wav_ASR	it was a hospital
UCL02a_568.078_5.12.wav_ASR	and i don't know
UCL02a_573.219_1.35.wav_ASR	oh yeah i mean you know what i mean
UCL02a_575.827_0.89.wav_ASR	well i remember after that
UCL02a_576.741_1.01.wav_ASR	is this about five hours
UCL02a_577.773_1.11.wav_ASR	and that is better
UCL02a_579.236_0.55.wav_ASR	and i'm gonna go
UCL02a_579.81_3.71.wav_ASR	it was quite in the evening as i went to school
UCL02a_584.84_3.59.wav_ASR	and people were stuck on the doctors and trying to write their names
UCL02a_588.451_4.45.wav_ASR	and it could be the my speech was even worse that very early on
UCL02a_593.524_2.64.wav_ASR	and the next day was well i just couldn't speak at all
UCL02a_597.058_3.09.wav_ASR	and i mean all the hospitals were there and looking at me and other people
UCL02a_600.25_1.04.wav_ASR	and i couldn't
UCL02a_602.917_2.26.wav_ASR	and i think i remember it
UCL02a_605.262_2.6.wav_ASR	the first the first day
UCL02a_608.048_0.74.wav_ASR	it's a lot of work
UCL02a_608.959_0.82.wav_ASR	it was terrible
UCL02a_609.799_0.88.wav_ASR	well i couldn't speak
UCL02a_610.7_0.75.wav_ASR	well people look at me
UCL02a_611.467_0.48.wav_ASR	and i said
UCL02a_613.201_2.54.wav_ASR	when people were talking to me
UCL02a_615.795_4.6.wav_ASR	and when they talked to me i couldn't say anything
UCL02a_620.505_0.55.wav_ASR	stool
UCL02a_621.961_1.52.wav_ASR	yeah those are they're writing down
UCL02a_624.359_1.26.wav_ASR	so doctor say that dad
UCL02a_625.666_1.39.wav_ASR	and i couldn't speak anything at all
UCL02a_628.52_4.16.wav_ASR	that's the worst for about you know about six months
UCL02a_632.699_1.28.wav_ASR	well i don't know
UCL02a_634.0_2.21.wav_ASR	well we're standing around at that thing
UCL02a_637.869_2.91.wav_ASR	and then after that he said
UCL02a_640.8_0.48.wav_ASR	so yes
UCL02a_641.3_2.15.wav_ASR	so firstnamem is the firstnamel place you know
UCL02a_644.103_1.81.wav_ASR	and then this place just the return to school
UCL02a_646.0_0.38.wav_ASR	what's the word
UCL02a_646.4_5.93.wav_ASR	the queen queen cinderella
UCL02a_652.975_4.0.wav_ASR	the university you know
UCL02a_657.478_1.21.wav_ASR	that was the first for two weeks or so
UCL02a_659.32_1.48.wav_ASR	and they test him up and all that
UCL02a_661.705_2.51.wav_ASR	so that that's i mean not being able to speak
UCL02a_664.318_1.87.wav_ASR	that's the first day they had me on the first stroke
UCL02a_675.556_1.58.wav_ASR	that's not getting any better you know
UCL02a_677.863_3.8.wav_ASR	peanut butter and jelly
UCL02a_681.681_3.38.wav_ASR	it was the next thing for me i spent about two weeks there
UCL02a_685.08_1.4.wav_ASR	well the first one you should use jelly
UCL02a_686.5_1.06.wav_ASR	well i don't know
UCL02a_687.622_3.32.wav_ASR	and then too excited the neurology
UCL02a_691.037_1.37.wav_ASR	well i kind of feel the first one is okay
UCL02a_693.677_2.17.wav_ASR	well i remember that was the first one about two years ago
UCL02a_695.871_6.85.wav_ASR	and then there was some people that were testing me for like an hour or two
UCL02a_704.304_2.18.wav_ASR	and somebody was to do it
UCL02a_706.5_3.48.wav_ASR	there's lots of tests me and things like that you know
UCL02a_712.938_1.25.wav_ASR	and she's supposed to be
UCL02a_714.208_1.77.wav_ASR	and you know these photographs of her
UCL02a_716.0_3.65.wav_ASR	and you know these are
UCL02a_719.666_1.46.wav_ASR	the dogs and things like that
UCL02a_721.149_1.73.wav_ASR	and what's this and some other things for me
UCL02a_723.85_4.47.wav_ASR	and sometimes i couldn't think what was going on
UCL02a_728.336_1.86.wav_ASR	you know he's just sad you like the photo of him
UCL02a_730.212_3.77.wav_ASR	is this a dog or you know squirrels and that kind of thing
UCL02a_738.114_2.95.wav_ASR	then after that about two weeks another stroke
UCL02a_741.126_4.6.wav_ASR	and then that was called the stroke communication disorder
UCL02a_747.398_2.78.wav_ASR	and the other thing was then one group of people said
UCL02a_750.539_5.96.wav_ASR	the stroke community help me for writing and everything else
UCL02a_757.561_3.75.wav_ASR	helping me some words
UCL02a_761.331_3.15.wav_ASR	you know it's monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday
UCL02a_764.5_1.42.wav_ASR	the first day i couldn't tell him
UCL02a_766.211_2.02.wav_ASR	and it was monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday
UCL02a_768.626_0.55.wav_ASR	and i couldn't remember
UCL02a_769.252_0.9.wav_ASR	it's it midnight to twelve
UCL02a_770.176_1.63.wav_ASR	and i could speak the word
UCL02a_772.961_6.7.wav_ASR	it's the first day third day first day second second third day
UCL02a_779.679_0.83.wav_ASR	and then i couldn't
UCL02a_781.953_1.63.wav_ASR	well i still know a problem like that
UCL02a_783.712_1.47.wav_ASR	is one two three four five six
UCL02a_785.2_1.08.wav_ASR	don't don't collect them
UCL02a_786.37_3.78.wav_ASR	but then the first one was healthy for me is i couldn't speak at all
UCL02a_790.171_3.41.wav_ASR	you know what i'm saying
UCL02a_793.6_0.79.wav_ASR	well how am i
UCL02a_795.524_1.21.wav_ASR	where are you going
UCL02a_796.901_1.38.wav_ASR	and i couldn't write what things are around
UCL02a_799.104_2.08.wav_ASR	that was difficult for me as well you know
UCL02a_801.24_3.72.wav_ASR	there was some people i spoke for is a good friend
UCL02a_806.4_3.15.wav_ASR	as about six years it was about six months i think
UCL02a_810.46_2.21.wav_ASR	every week for me someone was talking to me
UCL02a_812.693_6.05.wav_ASR	and just you know reading some words and helping out with that
UCL02a_818.791_1.44.wav_ASR	well i suppose that's about two weeks
UCL02a_821.718_4.68.wav_ASR	and then after that i said
UCL02a_826.419_1.74.wav_ASR	those three weeks and i said
UCL02a_828.767_2.69.wav_ASR	well i might six weeks or nine weeks
UCL02a_832.093_7.38.wav_ASR	and then the nine months and then with you at the university at florida state
UCL02a_840.063_1.49.wav_ASR	that was the first test as well
UCL02a_841.662_2.74.wav_ASR	and i thought to myself
UCL02a_845.928_4.83.wav_ASR	they think for me i you know with the stroke it was a real challenge
UCL02a_850.827_3.82.wav_ASR	and then those are the big problem for me is you know
UCL02a_854.716_0.61.wav_ASR	that was okay
UCL02a_856.337_3.78.wav_ASR	you know i've by the bus and the key and all that
UCL02a_860.14_0.69.wav_ASR	well i'll tell you
UCL02a_861.098_3.8.wav_ASR	can i make a peanut butter by that you know about the shoe or something
UCL02a_865.175_1.64.wav_ASR	and not being to help people was wonderful
UCL02a_867.837_2.54.wav_ASR	that's a bit weird
UCL02a_870.4_4.58.wav_ASR	and i think those other people there with the some people know what's going on
UCL02a_875.2_1.96.wav_ASR	if you're by yourself it's a pain
UCL02a_877.224_0.68.wav_ASR	well you're gonna hurt
UCL02a_878.342_1.19.wav_ASR	and it's gonna rain
UCL02a_881.28_2.41.wav_ASR	can be a word for me something else
UCL02a_883.763_1.66.wav_ASR	but i'm not much better than i was
UCL02a_885.443_1.45.wav_ASR	but you can be terrible at it
UCL02a_887.833_4.93.wav_ASR	and i don't speak about now to other people
UCL02a_893.03_5.1.wav_ASR	but i suppose after was that is pretty good
UCL02a_898.696_6.84.wav_ASR	but yeah i mean it was a good day
UCL02a_905.56_0.96.wav_ASR	and that's fine too
UCL02a_907.365_2.52.wav_ASR	but it just you know is my own brain thing you know
UCL02a_909.992_0.51.wav_ASR	well that's the way it goes
UCL02a_911.188_1.79.wav_ASR	it's making sense to me
UCL02a_940.576_0.67.wav_ASR	so they went to see the movie
UCL02a_941.493_0.61.wav_ASR	just say it again
UCL02a_942.392_1.14.wav_ASR	how do i say it again sorry
UCL02a_948.585_0.9.wav_ASR	what was the little kid
UCL02a_955.002_2.69.wav_ASR	when i was a kid i don't know what kids
UCL02a_966.107_3.03.wav_ASR	then then what do really happen to me you know
UCL02a_971.144_7.25.wav_ASR	is it making sense you know what what what was going on
UCL02a_978.444_0.75.wav_ASR	oh sorry you got yeah
UCL02a_979.633_2.56.wav_ASR	do you want me to speak the language and things like that
UCL02a_986.138_3.38.wav_ASR	yeah and if it's a sunny day outside it's quite pleasant of course
UCL02a_989.538_1.6.wav_ASR	well one i'm fifty eight
UCL02a_992.535_2.48.wav_ASR	but i wasn't a kid i was lucky when i was a kid
UCL02a_995.033_0.71.wav_ASR	his train is going
UCL02a_995.761_5.8.wav_ASR	mean i was about ten ten to thirty seven years old
UCL02a_1002.376_7.93.wav_ASR	and i was living in new york city
UCL02a_1010.322_6.55.wav_ASR	and i was born in school in england but then my dad had his job in london
UCL02a_1017.003_0.78.wav_ASR	how do we go back to school
UCL02a_1018.974_1.8.wav_ASR	but sure enough you took about that things happened to me
UCL02a_1020.913_2.78.wav_ASR	but i remember that was
UCL02a_1024.459_3.88.wav_ASR	they also lived in jamaica was well about you know five years ago but i don't know
UCL02a_1029.03_3.799.wav_ASR	and then back to the office
UCL02a_1033.867_3.061.wav_ASR	and it's strange because it's starting to rain
UCL02a_1038.126_1.02.wav_ASR	it was wonderful
UCL02a_1039.807_0.56.wav_ASR	what is it called
UCL02a_1040.387_2.99.wav_ASR	we lived in new york just outside of pennsylvania
UCL02a_1044.069_3.01.wav_ASR	we hadta move from the
UCL02a_1047.13_2.44.wav_ASR	from where was the difference you could see
UCL02a_1053.355_0.79.wav_ASR	vegas
UCL02a_1054.307_0.36.wav_ASR	okay
UCL02a_1055.824_2.03.wav_ASR	vegas
UCL02a_1058.851_0.67.wav_ASR	you know all that thing
UCL02a_1060.129_0.32.wav_ASR	and i'm fine
UCL02a_1061.36_1.67.wav_ASR	venice venice
UCL02a_1063.289_0.95.wav_ASR	kinda put the word in
UCL02a_1064.257_1.25.wav_ASR	you know the big one
UCL02a_1066.615_3.45.wav_ASR	and i don't know what's going on
UCL02a_1070.089_2.69.wav_ASR	it was up to me to be a kid again
UCL02a_1072.85_4.61.wav_ASR	okay that was good as far we lived not far away from each other
UCL02a_1077.477_6.2.wav_ASR	but then little kid and work around and people and wonderful food and all that
UCL02a_1083.7_1.68.wav_ASR	you know what i'm saying is wrong
UCL02a_1085.522_5.86.wav_ASR	but many time work work work work work
UCL02a_1091.399_3.32.wav_ASR	it was quite nice as well because they like some other pretty people
UCL02a_1094.81_4.37.wav_ASR	but she kicked and living the many of internet
UCL02a_1099.196_0.39.wav_ASR	and i said
UCL02a_1099.601_1.44.wav_ASR	it's a little kid going home
UCL02a_1101.086_0.74.wav_ASR	well i'll stop telling you
UCL02a_1102.743_1.24.wav_ASR	that was wonderful for me
UCL02a_1104.0_0.87.wav_ASR	oh i really was lost
UCL02a_1105.801_5.43.wav_ASR	and many times as well i remember this one
UCL02a_1111.66_5.83.wav_ASR	because i remember we lived in the other part was near there
UCL02a_1119.401_0.9.wav_ASR	it looks like it's raining
UCL02a_1122.722_0.47.wav_ASR	cut it up
UCL02a_1123.837_4.04.wav_ASR	that lovely place where the the ruins the ruins
UCL02a_1129.177_1.12.wav_ASR	peanut peanut butter
UCL02a_1130.398_0.47.wav_ASR	he said he could go
UCL02a_1131.367_2.59.wav_ASR	oh boy and there's wonderful as many times as you want
UCL02a_1134.864_5.68.wav_ASR	another one later called cinderella
UCL02a_1140.562_0.67.wav_ASR	and what is wrong
UCL02a_1141.249_0.33.wav_ASR	what's your story
UCL02a_1141.6_0.78.wav_ASR	well i don't know
UCL02a_1142.4_2.07.wav_ASR	well that's beautiful as well and going on for me
UCL02a_1146.5_0.73.wav_ASR	it was beautiful
UCL02a_1147.45_3.91.wav_ASR	well i don't know if this something was really good to me or was a good thing
UCL02a_1151.961_1.02.wav_ASR	now really feeling yeah
UCL02a_1153.0_1.95.wav_ASR	that that was pretty interesting
UCL02a_1155.978_1.45.wav_ASR	don't have any sense of what's going on
UCL02a_1157.451_2.07.wav_ASR	and firstnamel was obviously wonderful to me

wright204a_210.501_0.9.wav_ASR	what was one of the lucky ones
wright204a_212.664_5.3.wav_ASR	and i i was in three or four days
wright204a_218.922_5.15.wav_ASR	and really didn't come out of anything until later on
wright204a_225.73_0.45.wav_ASR	well i'd say
wright204a_227.123_9.64.wav_ASR	and i would say the middle of december just before christmas okay is when i remember a lot of things
wright204a_238.834_1.62.wav_ASR	and i was out for a lot of time
wright204a_240.614_4.38.wav_ASR	we had all kinds of tests and blood work
wright204a_247.286_2.71.wav_ASR	the other one i'm not aware of it
wright204a_250.143_1.63.wav_ASR	and i said
wright204a_252.388_1.03.wav_ASR	think that's what they're called
wright204a_255.308_1.49.wav_ASR	peanut butter it puts me to sleep
wright204a_258.047_5.38.wav_ASR	and from then on then they said
wright204a_263.563_11.04.wav_ASR	and i remember all the people where i had all three of them speech therapy
wright204a_285.874_1.82.wav_ASR	well i i'm a lot slower than i useta be
wright204a_288.289_6.62.wav_ASR	and i i hadta learn to use more of my left hand at the beginning
wright204a_295.072_5.09.wav_ASR	but i was paralyzed on the whole right side of my body
wright204a_301.173_1.18.wav_ASR	for a long time
wright204a_303.069_4.89.wav_ASR	when i get out of the hospital for the third time i i don't know what's going on
wright204a_315.318_2.19.wav_ASR	oh they were all all from one place
wright204a_318.564_0.31.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_319.489_15.42.wav_ASR	so i really from the beginning of october november december january until the end of january
wright204a_337.032_3.05.wav_ASR	because we had different problems
wright204a_340.132_1.81.wav_ASR	and i had firstnames
wright204a_343.379_4.39.wav_ASR	and i had some other kind of things that i wanted to do
wright204a_348.779_3.78.wav_ASR	and so it it took a long time just to get out of the hospital
wright204a_353.142_6.05.wav_ASR	but i was home in december to just celebrate
wright204a_360.553_13.81.wav_ASR	the first one i started out therapy at cheney cheney's
wright204a_375.474_6.3.wav_ASR	well i've been there for quite a while
wright204a_391.134_0.65.wav_ASR	that's correct
wright204a_400.899_0.38.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_423.934_1.43.wav_ASR	oh jeez
wright204a_426.385_3.17.wav_ASR	well i had a very long time
wright204a_430.939_2.71.wav_ASR	what's her name
wright204a_434.419_0.39.wav_ASR	mary
wright204a_435.869_1.32.wav_ASR	that was right there
wright204a_437.931_2.89.wav_ASR	my first child was a boy
wright204a_441.696_4.35.wav_ASR	my second third and fourth children were great kids
wright204a_448.445_4.81.wav_ASR	we just had her fifty one year of service
wright204a_454.55_4.98.wav_ASR	well it'll be a year in in march april april
wright204a_460.255_1.8.wav_ASR	we were the first fifty first
wright204a_462.698_3.202.wav_ASR	oh there's lots of things to do
wright204a_466.905_2.09.wav_ASR	and i had a good life as a kid
wright204a_469.055_1.22.wav_ASR	it was an only child
wright204a_471.226_6.03.wav_ASR	oh i i don't know
wright204a_488.482_2.61.wav_ASR	well i'll tell you the whole story
wright204a_551.677_4.2.wav_ASR	the little boy is playing with a soccer ball
wright204a_556.512_3.27.wav_ASR	and he happens to hit the window
wright204a_562.435_1.63.wav_ASR	and he goes away
wright204a_564.087_8.98.wav_ASR	and it the guy inside is is in the picture with the
wright204a_573.142_3.66.wav_ASR	and it hits a my guess or at least it comes close to it
wright204a_577.402_1.19.wav_ASR	so we're got clothes
wright204a_579.694_1.82.wav_ASR	and he said
wright204a_581.882_2.06.wav_ASR	and he looks at the window
wright204a_583.994_0.79.wav_ASR	and he has the ball
wright204a_584.804_8.2.wav_ASR	and apparently he's going out to see what happened and maybe let the ball go through the window
wright204a_611.342_0.53.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_612.361_1.49.wav_ASR	looks like it's ready for school
wright204a_614.634_3.67.wav_ASR	two she says looks like he might wanna take the slipper
wright204a_619.559_2.09.wav_ASR	and she's probably just sad
wright204a_623.716_0.88.wav_ASR	did she say
wright204a_625.692_0.59.wav_ASR	maybe not
wright204a_626.402_0.35.wav_ASR	don't know
wright204a_626.8_2.35.wav_ASR	because now he's going to school
wright204a_629.803_0.94.wav_ASR	oh i don't know it is
wright204a_630.763_0.47.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_633.482_1.14.wav_ASR	and she said
wright204a_634.899_1.17.wav_ASR	oh i don't think i need it
wright204a_637.004_1.53.wav_ASR	uhhuh i don't know
wright204a_639.482_1.63.wav_ASR	and he must be waiting for the ball
wright204a_641.129_1.2.wav_ASR	and it's kind of raining
wright204a_642.924_2.12.wav_ASR	so now it's coming down pretty good
wright204a_645.498_1.72.wav_ASR	so he goes back to the house
wright204a_647.796_0.36.wav_ASR	and i says
wright204a_648.654_0.66.wav_ASR	all wet
wright204a_650.019_0.33.wav_ASR	and she says
wright204a_651.289_1.3.wav_ASR	do you want me to take the umbrella
wright204a_672.485_0.54.wav_ASR	let's see
wright204a_677.959_4.91.wav_ASR	looks like the part is the cat is stuck in the tree
wright204a_683.65_0.4.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_685.27_2.21.wav_ASR	father is out on the
wright204a_687.552_3.18.wav_ASR	and he's kinda stuck himself in the mud
wright204a_691.424_2.46.wav_ASR	the little girl is crying for the cat
wright204a_694.509_1.57.wav_ASR	oh she got a new one
wright204a_696.668_4.34.wav_ASR	there's a dog barking at the a dog barking at the man
wright204a_701.845_1.46.wav_ASR	the fire department is coming
wright204a_703.403_5.75.wav_ASR	the little girl was trying to get the cat down
wright204a_709.619_2.69.wav_ASR	you know she was trying to get this ladder down
wright204a_712.623_1.35.wav_ASR	and i have no idea about it
wright204a_715.021_2.4.wav_ASR	but you know what i mean
wright204a_717.541_1.03.wav_ASR	firetruck is there
wright204a_718.865_6.08.wav_ASR	and they're coming out with a ladder apparently to help get the cat out of the tree
wright204a_729.715_0.44.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_730.298_1.47.wav_ASR	well that's a real picture
wright204a_733.872_5.81.wav_ASR	and this is a probably the best one
wright204a_740.511_1.38.wav_ASR	hopefully right here in arizona
wright204a_744.599_3.77.wav_ASR	the girl was pretty wise up about it
wright204a_749.301_2.17.wav_ASR	and this is her resurrection
wright204a_752.238_8.31.wav_ASR	and she is hanging on to a branch that they're trying to get her get her down from the tree
wright204a_764.718_0.38.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_772.353_0.32.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_776.476_0.63.wav_ASR	yes i do
wright204a_903.564_5.15.wav_ASR	what's her name
wright204a_911.851_7.38.wav_ASR	the story revolves around the two daughters and the what i call cinderella
wright204a_920.645_13.21.wav_ASR	and i i i couldn't remember even from looking at that what the relationship was to my father
wright204a_935.994_4.63.wav_ASR	yeah i know that she was like a fairy godmother
wright204a_941.361_9.2.wav_ASR	and had all to to to was they were really good
wright204a_950.842_7.62.wav_ASR	well she was always doing stuff where the other two girls were you know not very good
wright204a_958.521_3.91.wav_ASR	and was all nice and stuff for her
wright204a_962.813_18.18.wav_ASR	when they went to the the ball it turned out that the cinderella was going to go
wright204a_982.77_14.44.wav_ASR	when they got away because it was a a pumpkin that was gonna turn into a a stagecoach that was gonna turn into a a carriage
wright204a_997.767_7.21.wav_ASR	and she
wright204a_1006.404_0.31.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_1007.312_9.14.wav_ASR	and so then when i the people i guess one of the most important to me
wright204a_1018.414_1.11.wav_ASR	well when i was a doctor
wright204a_1019.765_5.209.wav_ASR	it's it's
wright204a_1026.704_2.301.wav_ASR	see this is when i traveled with this group
wright204a_1029.076_5.01.wav_ASR	we're trying to get
wright204a_1037.097_1.48.wav_ASR	it's the prince the prince
wright204a_1039.786_3.76.wav_ASR	and he he he was going to school
wright204a_1044.411_1.69.wav_ASR	and he was out of there
wright204a_1047.777_0.92.wav_ASR	he had the shoe on
wright204a_1049.77_4.47.wav_ASR	and it this shoe the only one that really fit was cinderella
wright204a_1055.312_1.88.wav_ASR	and so he said
wright204a_1057.679_2.63.wav_ASR	and they'll be it will be man and woman
wright204a_1060.912_1.76.wav_ASR	you know everything will be fine forever
wright204a_1067.508_0.34.wav_ASR	okay
