AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0019663_0019800	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0121416_0121534	yeah we're gonna meet up
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0035713_0035849	uh i mean we're not even there yet
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0187312_0187486	um one day afternoon
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0085470_0085653	yeah that's what we need yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0128003_0128125	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0002779_0002990	let's talk about it
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0159403_0159664	we can always decide then i mean you know
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0150042_0150192	you still yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0147125_0147573	well yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0099998_0100130	oh um i don't know
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0183644_0183749	that's cool
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0104146_0104463	so even if it doesn't work you can dig a re package around and make it work
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0208960_0209241	but most will probably want to go with the files
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0064139_0064653	you opened the window you read through it you might click on you know close it again straight away
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0031789_0031923	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0114347_0114848	and mean if you already started on on doing stuff i guess we can
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0001232_0001522	so what do we need to talk about
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0032731_0033237	we don't we're not actually sure what the user wants with it but it's interesting so why not give it to him
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0063079_0063650	probably just two or two or three of whatever whatever they're looking at like diagonal acts to whatever circumstances
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0117355_0118027	but well whatever it was last week then
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0018003_0018170	that's a good point
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0089197_0089641	actually is the code accessible like the the guido stuff that you've done uh th
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0161524_0161669	won't be the whole thing then
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0047814_0048253	so there's a d so it'll be a choice from the menu but yeah exactly
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0066991_0067105	me neither
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0046605_0046933	well it it might come to us we start playing with it
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0150408_0150546	okay yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0127448_0127916	okay
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0207817_0207928	oh
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0069723_0070329	yeah it changed the contents of the same window like from transmission to summary
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0193221_0193326	yeah some people also
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0093398_0093531	okay yeah yeah okay right
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0193805_0193935	into what
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0175999_0176266	maybe you should make it exit then
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0059290_0059432	now mm
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0002820_0003016	okay
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0186866_0187030	what money
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0175667_0176204	that's got a slighty really
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0029777_0029908	yeah that's true yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0199994_0200131	for the receiver
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0166778_0167381	the project report is two and a half third uh party
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0125645_0125768	that's pretty solar isn't it
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0160782_0161336	well it'll be you're still a limited version of you on the next curve
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0044106_0044434	so it'll be like all the um cases of that topic
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0193562_0193757	whether he's gonna get us access into the
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0087802_0087921	and price target of the guy
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0143627_0144045	combin combining it out one by at a time and running it does it work yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0058505_0058736	and less um you can't hear it properly or something
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0005142_0005935	we've got a bunch of um which comes up automatically with the transcription box and the topics
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0196589_0196765	so what time do we say
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0048635_0049016	yeah but then then there's a problem with a lot of windows popping up again
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0116852_0117355	th i really have to don't anything this week because this weeks been magic
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0192791_0192913	you do need to have a cake for it
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0203466_0203610	think yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0086888_0087101	so i guess that's what we need to aim for
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0140326_0140557	you know whatever you wanna do then just send me an email
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0077098_0077878	have all these sort of using the same window and so we can put a lot of and probably mutually um
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0099449_0099697	it could tell you what i done an s. p. two
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0190013_0190197	or three thirty
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0067707_0067992	oh you should be able to
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0038530_0038786	have a right click for for these very things to yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0075205_0075352	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0022916_0023124	that's true yeah it's more intuitive this isn't it
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0103624_0103767	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0206079_0206202	you can have it
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0136115_0136646	just that it you know you d you define a search object and then you search that that string
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0187767_0188059	now in between those yeah like one or three
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0022415_0022683	it's more obvious isn't it w what you can do
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0189678_0189903	uh but we ha
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0049016_0049385	and they pop up without you even being quite sure what it is you don't mean
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0085882_0086008	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0084417_0084676	that's not it's not gonna be a lot more work
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0000540_0000872	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0188099_0188231	three o'clock
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0072576_0072925	even have two of them in the same yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0099650_0099878	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0096253_0096476	the end browser for meeting
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0075637_0075770	yeah you can minimise 'em
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0132517_0132635	and then yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0084151_0084417	um i'm pretty much gotten there anyway to be honest
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0174020_0174401	the significance of reality
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0166387_0166559	um
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0173753_0173939	that doesn't exist
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0146177_0146599	but i'm still a little bit of the bottom of the bottom
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0016434_0016638	we could put it on a right click
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0109961_0110119	okay
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0068028_0068145	let's see
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0099664_0099913	okay
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0160316_0160588	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0183594_0183865	next week sometime
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0101489_0101940	like the the in inverted files down and um the next circuitary and all that
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0127277_0127378	woah
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0199647_0200193	we should be it shouldn't be any well it's supposed to be next week
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0212007_0212165	woah
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0206263_0206578	had a don't know if there was something
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0066473_0066660	for something like that two w two ones
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0004829_0004932	okay
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0022508_0022651	it's more eclectic price isn't it
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0146201_0146304	uh-huh
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0184062_0184390	oh yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0147251_0147568	okay
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0131951_0132084	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0202399_0202522	that's a bit biased already
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0117803_0118064	well
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0162239_0162386	so also for example
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0095076_0095254	eight four five euro five six et cetera
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0196080_0196423	oh i've got it in my computer
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0131325_0132073	yeah so i don't know if you've looked at the search query s language but it's like a dollar a text say
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0120585_0120701	yeah that's fun
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0057088_0057255	but at the moment no
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0178441_0178929	and then then we could discuss at next meeting which options we uh really wanna include
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0014755_0015291	but that'd be a bit annoying if you have left click for one thing and double click for something else
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0118821_0118966	that's right yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0002707_0002820	seems like you've done some stuff
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0061802_0062025	that's what i feel as well
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0067517_0067620	does anybody know how to do that
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0056175_0056388	yeah single channel that single channel files
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0145209_0145714	so basically we gotta kind of ditch in work really i think that's the l to the end of that isn't it
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0158434_0159102	we'll probably get some work done over the weekend so i don't know if after the financial or something maybe just have a little quick little update and just
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0051484_0051863	it's the first time i've ever seen a remote control
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0115338_0115519	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0082966_0083521	and it kind of just it just develops i'm not aiming for anything
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0105376_0105513	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0082025_0082238	what kind of prototype could be produced
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0073445_0073665	and you're always g for every going i'll get out of the way
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0115829_0115980	meet up and see what we could do
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0059679_0060216	yeah because otherwise it will be t it will increase the amount of data we need by a lot won't it
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0019685_0019789	if you just yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0082427_0082876	because i'm uh i'm just you know i'm going to the lab and i say right what i'm gonna change today
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0201020_0201252	but i think w i mean like all the costs
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0128090_0128300	but you know you could have a look at it
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0019485_0019663	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0129792_0130668	it does does an an extra charge for the strength i don't know transcript or text or whatever
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0130698_0131380	for and it what it like it just has an open available transport this whatever find everything that's got that and then light
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0209873_0210490	yeah exactly and just the other comment about whether you wanna do both speaker characterization and topic segmentation
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0189903_0190011	what's what you have to
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0192373_0192682	yeah right
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0169920_0170266	just looking at my own details
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0149292_0149397	oh mm
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0209487_0209690	oh that was what he said that i guess
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0127378_0127795	well they did say wasn't the most efficient
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0109386_0109613	okay
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0081037_0081143	oh yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0115519_0115636	should we i don't know
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0155035_0155705	well i'm not doing any background reading so you know
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0149932_0150211	you do
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0083521_0083648	do we want aim for something
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0095493_0095832	and then um there's a folder um an l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0068145_0068259	and so you could do anything
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0002147_0002311	now a lot
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0056580_0057088	probably not but we might need them for this fluencies if we try to do it in audio
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0037629_0037844	is that just from the mean
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0116848_0117033	yeah exactly exactly
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0120083_0120184	let's say you
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0104872_0105003	missing around still hmm
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0035475_0035713	yeah i mean that's that's still another level further
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0192242_0192775	we can go the look uh we can look it now afterwards
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0109230_0110041	so it'll come up on the screen for the moment but i haven't managed to put it into a projector or a whatever in java to play with it
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0211382_0211679	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0137664_0137928	so do you have to write it in the way that they wrote it is or we did
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0015291_0015579	um i think so yeah when you left a cat
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0097001_0097137	do you mean
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0049626_0050203	but if you do double click on something don't you expect something to happen then
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0096861_0096996	it's just p personal costs
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0116842_0116961	yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0199278_0199452	maybe it doesn't happen at all
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0088004_0088628	well if i guess i mean that was probably our intention but we m might not have written it down
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0097408_0097519	have got files that i think
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0083778_0083904	um
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0174256_0174363	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0050456_0050574	it sounds like you did it by accident like
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0113394_0114347	um yeah i guess i mean it was a good point he had that like collaborating with the file things
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0212592_0212738	okay
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0170294_0170594	yeah but then there's a lot of it
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0098772_0098929	someone else wanna talk about this up
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0119940_0120083	oh wait
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0085653_0085983	something just slightly more than just that on its own
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0160605_0160782	could be that hard
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0136646_0136971	had to figure out how to how to do the same thing for the summary
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0183976_0184292	in the morning
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0122509_0122961	well y the browsers as i use it now or as uh uh you know
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0032239_0032507	oh mean it's the speaker activation is a bit like you said
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0146004_0146201	uh-huh
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0091941_0092409	the not done the delay they're only delayed then only you can read them back for example
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0014258_0014411	can you use double click or
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0088721_0088976	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0184576_0184735	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0212600_0212704	just signing off in it
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0077312_0077525	yeah they're definitely gonna be in the same window yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0204224_0204578	yeah that we will probably have yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0129035_0129151	it's okay
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0091452_0091735	uh don't know if it's readable at the moment but you can show have a d have a look
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0066792_0066942	tops are nice
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0176204_0176314	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0186513_0186630	um yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0187051_0187192	next yeah this money
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0092409_0092544	you can see them but you can't read them
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0181391_0181684	just like accessing the documents and stuff
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0088628_0088867	so i guess
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0047355_0047814	you have the menu right clicking but instead of like have a default double click
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0151060_0151220	you have some time why not
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0019845_0020242	to just have sort of main same sort of edition through 'kay
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0103977_0104086	oh right
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0137932_0138302	yeah just search for specific string
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0116472_0116734	uh
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0039120_0039859	but you wanna somehow click be able to click on a topic and it pops up with all the meetings that contain that
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0137198_0137323	oh let's see oh this
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0141071_0141221	oh yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0107249_0107771	like extracting things from the x. m. l. files and stuff to be able to do the indexing
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0211713_0211898	oh think we need to tick the okay buttons right
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0036132_0036419	you we have to first define what what happens when you click on a user
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0114890_0115025	should share as much as possible
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0200193_0200308	it's weak six next week
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0036443_0036813	we have to have a speaker characterisation first before we cross any other uh projects
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0096603_0096861	how would we everybody have to look in my directory
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0067488_0067598	don't know he said it
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0117565_0117771	this weeks only two days old
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0063271_0063546	two or three maybe but yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0061525_0062063	think we probably need that to have the the full flexibility we need to have that there but um yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0150288_0150408	these can be changed as well
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0204578_0204860	lost week
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0132084_0132683	yeah yeah 'cause that's the i 'cause that's the i 'cause that's the
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0067089_0067346	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0018189_0018372	oh
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0067093_0067298	yeah yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0005935_0006681	and then when you go on the menu you can select a summarisation box which pops up and an audio player
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0202392_0202622	exactly yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0209577_0209692	oh
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0092251_0092382	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0153025_0153272	is that in in formats curves
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0101288_0101585	um yeah it's searching yeah oh yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0094325_0094677	oh a. four five far five
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0068785_0069057	the eight is sometimes it's a bit difficult
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0054629_0054823	yeah what you're clicking on
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0118367_0118669	yeah it's been all a bit marked the last m last yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0054942_0055367	um yeah another thing
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0030633_0030899	the speaker circuitation tied into i don't know
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0035849_0036132	you know it doesn't even doesn't even pop up the speech recognition yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0093953_0094325	oh no
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0067992_0068134	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0078405_0078674	yeah do you wanna do that with summaries then
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0043260_0043622	and then that's kind of a typical kinda action that would happen
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0190345_0190549	it'll be necessary necessarily short f
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0050347_0050518	but well i don't know
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0119388_0119603	which is only a page long but it's quite difficult to write a page
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0121856_0122358	yeah hopefully i have something by next week that we can sort of try to integrate into the guy
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0071903_0072556	oh no it could be like transmission summary like two batteries and you just press on which ever you want
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0074777_0074938	it uh yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0152802_0153029	but it's in in two weeks
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0052354_0053059	but but yeah but i don't i don't i d really don't see anything obvious that that
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0161669_0161948	um like we can just decide sort of the things that we do want to do
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0146751_0146953	actually i don't think it should have that much to do at the moment
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0115980_0116747	um i mean i don't know see what you've done and see what we need when we know more of what we need maybe
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0191580_0192089	the c that's computer rooms in here the m. f. t. computer lab in oh it's in here
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0050717_0050901	still coming up
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0172494_0172917	wasn't like what you had now wasn't that pretty much what we agreed on
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0164731_0165115	yeah it'll get behind schedule yeah pretty quick
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0163891_0164297	just that i think we need to set ourself some alliances because otherwise
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0175200_0175308	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0141020_0141277	okay
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0068026_0068178	but but mm
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0029782_0030242	um i don't really know how to involve the speaker capabilities into the browsing
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0011582_0012313	or we can put an extra button extra few buttons next to a summary button so that you actually in the transition box
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0182306_0182820	can take it for a tropical sometime
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0147120_0147459	yeah exactly
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0202522_0202670	they didn't really know what was going on
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0167535_0167757	so it's what is that two weeks okay
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0199514_0199666	so it sounds like me
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0143975_0144143	exactly yes
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0023804_0024042	but we're probably not gonna be adding too many things
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0002801_0003073	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0176358_0176565	it's gonna be a little difficult more difficult
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0056935_0057122	well uh yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0000361_0000468	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0023492_0023804	where is a menu type thing is more flexible that way
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0168904_0169056	okay so y
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0023440_0023676	maybe maybe
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0103473_0103608	uh yeah could i have a look at it
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0165115_0165239	like you say yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0192089_0192700	well if you find me i'll show you what w i'll i'll let us all in there and we can go in there
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0150546_0150752	um i don't know it doesn't matter
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0066942_0067089	oh like tabs
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0030336_0030633	yeah let me maybe tie that in with dialogue acts or something as well
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0042816_0043260	like if we have it so it's set up that's um if you double click and it goes to a default thing on the menu
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0057255_0057500	but th yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0031139_0031547	like we have it we're doing it but what how does it help the browsing
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0015579_0016074	you can for example set set the market there so that the the audio goes from there i think
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0069694_0069876	but yeah that that might be an idea yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0142648_0142769	exactly
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0117533_0118031	yeah i mean between um yes yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0150022_0150349	oh okay
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0064834_0065636	but uh well can we i mean you probably i don't know if you wanna have like the the full transcript and the summary at the same time
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0001521_0002417	well shall we just go round and everyone says what they what they've been doing how far they've got
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0124483_0124642	so when it when it
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0103286_0103406	oh up per
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0156712_0157002	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0089641_0090010	like can we just like copy like the latest stuff out of your directory some more
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0101383_0101731	oh that
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0142167_0142569	and i have delayed through out to throw out all the functions i have you know that i don't need
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0186612_0186822	it's the money money it might be good um
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0073095_0073445	so there's a priority that has a lot of windows if you have a user focused got loads
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0064862_0064969	think what we're doing is fine
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0168794_0168904	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0002417_0002522	well i say
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0133778_0134161	words or text or something in it so just searches for those files
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0191393_0191513	yeah what front end
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0103097_0103239	oh that's pretty much there is it
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0066465_0066707	oh i was just thinking of tap
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0090334_0090526	uh don't know can you access other people's
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0048370_0048684	like i'm no show the speaker characterisation for instance
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0128800_0129035	so or how does it work that
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0050901_0051245	yeah it's not it's not the end of the world
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0208880_0209062	from a single up yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0038786_0039120	yeah there's a second thing about the topics the topic window
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0201252_0201545	so uh there's not a point in having
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0207928_0208146	which one is the top one
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0133367_0133778	and all the transcript files have got the stream i don't know what it is
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0073967_0074082	it's not like pops
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0185690_0185974	so so yeah i know exactly exactly that's what i'm thinking
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0192975_0193087	okay
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0132390_0132517	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0018170_0018296	oh no
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0171814_0172395	and then if you want you can give that to me and i'll i'll build your nice you know a few tick boxes and drop down menus
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0079370_0079997	but transcribes uh sounds reasonable to have like transcript like maybe three alternantis then
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0157652_0158052	did we wanna meet before we talk to steve next week
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0051763_0052198	well i'll i'll check what it does on on um double click at the moment
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0112504_0113049	of course i'm making a mail of it
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0174055_0174256	yeah that's it's quite impressive already
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0177789_0177962	the decide on that on the over the weekend
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0108343_0108907	have been trying to write something to read the excel and get rid of it
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0213503_0213747	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0153425_0153739	oh it like digital okay okay
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0032138_0032239	that don't know about that
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0067699_0067902	uh i don't think double a. and a half is how to do that really
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0210621_0210766	so yeah that's okay
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0194037_0194480	yeah it's only got its crap it's only got about four five computers in but it would do quite good for our job
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0160177_0160605	and well sure why not
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0090504_0090785	you can make y if you make it writable than anybody can i suggest so
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0196431_0196575	well the comments i'm thinking
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0201901_0202026	um something like that
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0105058_0105219	but the basics is that okay that's good
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0142505_0142623	yeah right
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0177317_0177653	we never agreed on what we wanna be able to search for
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0053232_0053373	and if you can think of something but
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0028511_0029029	um i don't know i mean it's more like part of the
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0140885_0141114	have you animated your code nice
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0075888_0076047	okay well it's alright then
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0087094_0087314	think that's kinda what i meant as well isn't it really
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0163096_0163352	the summary topics transcript
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0016268_0016434	um so we can't put it on lefty
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0017064_0017669	so right click on it menu you know and you can click on speak characterisation up pops the window
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0120427_0120774	yeah but the p. p. l. p.
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0211914_0212391	if you're okay with uh having uh
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0020464_0020661	um or just you know or just the button
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0119772_0119940	uh that's complete rubbishy
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0111940_0112175	the
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0035495_0035633	and in that way but i don't know
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0195055_0195472	and it's a fake copy yeah with the code on it yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0013662_0014263	that part of speech or whatever that what he's been saying you know the the left click highlights it
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0188355_0188627	th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0022303_0022415	well oh yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0135749_0136115	um um well it's in the code
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0151914_0152324	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0041128_0042077	so we have basically two options of of browsing the meetings is by either um searching and opening individual observations
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0127599_0127915	uh it does load up quite quickly
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0087314_0087615	ting it till it sort of start to do stuff rather than just be
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0207601_0208075	can you read that
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0016638_0016875	we could for example have a little menu that pops up
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0093261_0093398	we could just email to answer
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0090010_0090601	uh like if we're gonna just try and like take a look or something try and just plug some stuff i think it can if
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0117886_0118016	oh the last thing
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0196807_0196960	oh i just think it's better to do it afterwards
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0142769_0142891	yes
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0099194_0099473	don't worry about it
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0023119_0023309	but well we can have both but whatever
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0074042_0074793	but i mean people get used to when you use a windows or a linux for that matter you have a lot of windows open
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0080687_0080793	yes that's good
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0102255_0102357	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0101792_0102458	so it just found the total but uh inverted uh search and indexing but i haven't read it yet
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0102357_0102731	so you could probably just use that code like that was behind the question you asked them earlier
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0173610_0173763	oh okay
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0093919_0094050	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0096372_0096633	yes i'm for meeting
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0117033_0117172	so you're still working
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0030899_0031139	it just some way to sort of leverage that information
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0188886_0189228	unless you wanna do after um after t.
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0202026_0202188	the thing one or couple of costs are called
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0186274_0186440	pick a time
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0050901_0051126	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0153272_0153425	oh oh
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0195537_0195672	that'd come in handy
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0019281_0019509	yeah so yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0086536_0086642	yeah definitely
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0213148_0213262	should we turn these off then or
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0002787_0003057	okay
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0061410_0061622	do you think do you think it's really the end
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0171085_0171814	maybe you should decide pretty pretty early what kind of things you wanna be able to search for
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0094000_0094135	okay you're number
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0157002_0157469	oh i don't know is that about it then or anything else we need to discuss
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0097137_0097408	now i'm i'm i'm extremely organise you think
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0204721_0204855	okay
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0156411_0156771	oh we have a win in this course is over okay
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0156158_0156528	yeah me too
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0021828_0022161	well no no you still have the menu the menu pop up that
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0103281_0103473	yeah well uh i don't know if it's useable
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0026438_0026635	is that gonna be useful or too much
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0118578_0118835	well uh well you're an s. p. two and a s. p. two right
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0018136_0018302	so
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0067627_0067774	now
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0036739_0036844	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0081658_0082025	and finally the prototype he spoke about
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0190197_0190345	then just yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0182497_0182770	or like like the you know the class paths all that sort of thing
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0192972_0193082	it's got a lot of but
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0103100_0103274	you found some code for it
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0003057_0003385	well i've got a browser now which whoops
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0206959_0207489	um the same things as in the comments if i could read it
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0057083_0057836	and then we might use them well wo to work with them but do we wanna integrate them uh so that when you browse you can here is
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0045256_0045466	um
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0186440_0186706	uh i uh you know let me know whatever
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0142891_0143171	so they're all in there yet still
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0111440_0111661	yeah yeah uh i'm sorry i do
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0036813_0037031	totally i think it
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0049470_0049688	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0142482_0142647	just in case
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0091362_0091506	that might be it could be an idea
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0047821_0048342	oh so i and it figures out what's the most common used to double clee
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0148033_0148494	oh i can't remember what i'm supposed to do by the way
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0050686_0050787	yeah exactly
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0181742_0182107	just like all in seeing the code and just sort of how just see the basics of what you've done
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0044434_0044882	either whatever we decide with the default to be whether it's in all meetings or just in one meeting
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0196423_0196524	whatever is my computer
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0055367_0055554	single audio files
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0106854_0107249	uh i mean how much do we actually need to do
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0108907_0109230	and i can get rid of it but i'm having trouble putting it in anywhere else
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0152113_0152802	well i'm doing communications which we had one exercise and i've done that like two weeks ago
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0045449_0045889	so if somebody knows exactly what they wanna do and we know that that's the most common thing that's gonna happen
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0213928_0214081	does she still hear
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0190431_0190658	mean s three three or after what
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0197879_0198035	as long as d. n. l. c. doesn't go late
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0064717_0064841	oh i think it's fine is fine
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0200596_0201020	we have one class at least when we like speech perception we don't have any extras
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0019509_0019685	so but that be yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0205523_0205676	what's there anything else
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0004091_0004413	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0075352_0075888	unless you i don't suppose you can minimise them and stuff like that can you could you do that
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0197135_0197413	rather than have half an hour and then we'll we'll surely run out
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0066363_0066473	it's like have a tape there
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0195765_0196060	oh this is that the futuristic i heard uh heard about it
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0145854_0146061	the weekends are still four days off
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0061004_0061410	yeah w what do people think in general about the windows cluttering that is it mentioned
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0068134_0068297	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0160327_0160522	you gonna implement that
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0029382_0029782	more than uh the speaker cura citation as m steven mentioned
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0127915_0128090	so you know it's not too bad
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0033408_0033513	uh i think we should do it
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0067816_0068028	oh do you reckon
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0070776_0071251	yeah or even just have buttons on it toggle buttons or something on the total bar for that window
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0159741_0159994	um so what what are you planning to do over the weekend then
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0205048_0205523	yeah um i guess that's it
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0050651_0051022	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0019405_0019811	yeah this would be a bit a bit weird for it to just start bringing up stuff without it
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0158298_0158434	well i don't know
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0139668_0140326	if you have uh a question about what the t the code means or where to find the code that you want it
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0005038_0005142	so yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0057791_0058099	we might want to be able to say oh just give me what that person's saying
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0067902_0068026	maybe uh you probably can
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0052255_0052654	yeah that's good start
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0128916_0129092	now this is not the actual search
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0040426_0040582	and it's consistent round
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0138539_0139209	so you could just you know you could use that when you if you wanna um take the data out and put it on
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0122358_0122504	okay
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0184390_0184885	well that's time i'm dictating the time 'cause i if i'm not there you can't do anything
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0124736_0125544	to get the data for example to get the summarization data you have to search for i think the ideas or something
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0026807_0027289	so what d you part of the m the menu that comes down is says give me your menus or something
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0148494_0148752	and i'm supposed to do the summarisation thing you Bob
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0014263_0014755	so that you can i don't know how to happen when you double click actually
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0001907_0002369	that didn't be done anything
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0044882_0045291	and just up the the particular interests of that topic in the middle
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0191260_0191791	uh we well we can get in through the through the the the cord the cord door
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0173365_0173753	that's completely cut and pasted
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0120774_0121027	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0054234_0054469	and i guess it depends on the
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0023188_0023463	like if we wanna add more things in the future then we have well new buttons
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0172917_0173184	or was it just like that one
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0159233_0159403	yeah if you like
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0153784_0153900	oh let's uh yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0040278_0040500	and have a different menu for it
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0185631_0185865	yeah it's not gonna take an hour to explain it you know
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0071899_0072058	just can be yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0201698_0201870	think it was just a bank order wasn't it
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0022651_0023204	that's called a button
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0102731_0103149	just you know the reusing code and stuff it's just like okay 'kay
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0209644_0209866	yeah i think you comment it's the basic the same as what you said
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0156771_0157064	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0101685_0101792	yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0086073_0086473	just so see the integration works sort of between the different components
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0004372_0004550	this wasn't a good start
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0077822_0077961	expensive
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0149880_0150007	that's uh oh really
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0117363_0117533	yes exactly same uh
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0003804_0004372	well i dropped mine as well
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0076219_0076581	yeah like a lot of these can be like once we get the disfluencies out then we can yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0077961_0078225	yeah that that was the plan for the display anyway
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0196960_0197135	then we have all the time we need
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0006879_0007304	um and i s i think the search works as well so you can pop up a search
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0156246_0156562	will be happy when this week is over
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0043622_0044106	if you double click on a particular topic or something then it goes to sort of a like a default view
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0068294_0068404	if you really need what you're doing
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0177980_0178441	yeah do you wanna you know just get together and think about the different types of circuit we could possibly do
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0076972_0077180	yeah that's true they they are definitely
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0126372_0126907	so they don't you know they don't say look in that and that folder but they say search everything
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0141114_0141347	oh yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0098011_0098236	for all that anyway
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0150349_0150482	okay
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0202348_0202617	yeah which should be a crap yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0164782_0164907	we will go by and
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0090732_0091278	well if you just tell us the directory and just make the file readable then we know the directory to get in then and just
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0017692_0017968	what else could we have in the menu
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0182770_0183332	like just to say okay well here's you know everything's basic and set up and then just you know just jump right in
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0141861_0142167	that they gave us had a lot of extra stuff in
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0058175_0058529	uh i mean it's not gonna make much sense if you uh listen to it on it anyway
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0188627_0188749	it was a one time deal and i'd say
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0056045_0056157	you mean single channel
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0187237_0187767	at time um not at n not it new or two or four
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0030163_0030404	it will be nice to have it in icon integrated with a lot on
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0200409_0200538	that don't think we have a reading with that
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0112175_0112406	oh yeah oh well
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0104524_0104872	we'll probably have to do some other file manage volume i don't know creation
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0012313_0012838	but so like you click on a button and then it opens whatever that speak a characterisation is
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0103608_0104072	but but i found some code for like from a titanium about uh indexing
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0204092_0204431	the l. c. d. will probably have classi yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0093781_0093953	it's in all the emails
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0203610_0204092	think d. i. will probably have one to make up for our missing classes
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0082870_0083007	okay
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0039767_0039903	right yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0188093_0188254	oh
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0198860_0199278	what's c she doesn't even know what she's talking about yet
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0110041_0110272	but i guess it's not very difficult
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0055863_0056045	we don't know yet that we ha i think
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0156044_0156191	oh
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0032507_0032731	uh mean it's like a nice thing
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0062025_0062566	uh mean i'm i'm very much i w i wanna have everything customisable
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0051364_0051484	yeah yeah yeah oh yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0166146_0166411	well you decide i'm not doing much for that project
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0040001_0040143	oh yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0155828_0155954	um
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0075628_0075840	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0058736_0058939	somebody is talking over somebody else or something
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0000789_0000894	okay
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0050661_0051319	especially if you have a touch pad
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0000358_0000538	yeah exactly yeah yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0202617_0203004	uh think the endpoints had uh were off totally
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0161336_0161524	but oh no
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0042077_0042413	and when then we have the entire linking by right click basically
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0040963_0041128	so yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0039955_0040278	so we could do that in a similar way do it right click as well
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0165239_0165581	well actually do we wanna set a date for internet prototype
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0093469_0093781	well it's it's not difficult
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0007975_0008475	you have to either open open a particular operation or do a search and open it through that
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0091683_0091941	oh no uh it it's not well readable
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0062635_0063079	well the thing is typically though is someone gonna have five windows open at the same time probably not
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0076581_0077006	of transcript without the disfluency transcribed with a definant disfluency
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0055554_0055657	do we wanna use them or not
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0183749_0183976	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0191133_0191290	oh we haven't got a c. d.
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0182107_0182452	like just get a quick look over and just the basics
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0024337_0025195	you can have a menu instead of a button
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0106053_0106854	uh i'm i was a bit worried about one well when he talked about this with um uh file messenger files
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0189157_0189286	yeah that's an option too
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0021960_0022078	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0205676_0206048	do any one of you wanna like take care of this or should i take care of it
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0028670_0028789	it's an idea
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0079078_0079370	yeah um well could oh i don't know
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0078674_0078914	put the summaries in in the same window
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0073677_0073785	yeah exactly
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0118966_0119388	and then we had to do an i. r. p. whatever it was that cost as well
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0133146_0133367	these files i've got um the an idea
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0211427_0211614	alright
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0023928_0024337	well in uh i guess in in in meeting browser one point one
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0091705_0091985	it think by default they are i think really
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0165701_0165820	specifically a date
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0150440_0150541	shall i do that then
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0022781_0022916	yeah that's alright
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0007304_0007975	and it loads up um just the background window so empty and um so when you start
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0060216_0060330	the top point will be bigger
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0153288_0153740	yeah it's uh y nine nine coins as well or ten or something
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0213391_0213503	we're done now
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0121271_0121856	yeah i was thinking in the week end probably get uh start itacking this seriously then just um
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0173910_0174620	yeah this is elimination
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0109252_0109389	okay
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0168279_0168401	ish yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0024516_0024746	current current
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0051365_0051759	yeah alright
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0211532_0211708	it's a cat
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0024381_0024516	oh no i don't know why
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0170421_0170824	um or when the the search interface
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0132635_0133008	because every every ev all of these um
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0155656_0155807	so sorry
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0199088_0199348	it's a two
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0173939_0174331	nei they don't move that much
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0092884_0093251	um so the directory is my number
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0137199_0137656	had to um i had to understand how to do the transca how they did the transcript to do the summary myself
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0023050_0023188	but then it's not as expensive
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0093642_0093761	what's your number
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0155364_0155633	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0037844_0038530	is that is that for any particular w window like if we wanna sort of get like if we're on the users versus like a top or something
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0080447_0080587	yeah i'm gonna make sense
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0036798_0036933	yes
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0027270_0027918	yeah so when you write click on it one one option will be give me all your meetings characterise the speaker
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0069530_0069723	or just the i don't know
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0068460_0068785	it's a bit of a triple r. s. and it's a bit of a triple r. s and it's a bit of a triple r. s and it's a bit of a triple r. s and it's a bit of a triple r. s and it's a bit of a triple r. s and it's a bit of a triple r. s and it's a bit of a triple r. s and it's a bit of a triple r. s and it's a bit of a triple r. s and it's a bit of a triple r. s and it's a bit of a triple r. s and it's a bit of a triple r. s and it's a bit of a triple r. s and it's a bit of a triple r. s and it's a bit of a triple r. s and it's a bit of a triple r. s and it's a bit of a triple r. s and it
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0175377_0175487	it's screen shot of google
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0111508_0111638	put it into a window at least
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0124017_0124283	which i think is old but i'm not quite sure how it works here
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0193279_0193562	actually i was asking steve about that whether we can get in there
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0004152_0004342	give it to this
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0009603_0010391	um now i wonder how we wanna do you know we wanna pop up window with the speaker characterisation
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0212165_0212502	exciting
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0063967_0064139	and the summary for example is typical
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0010958_0011582	either we can when you click on the the i. d. any sort of i. d. in the transmission box
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0076088_0076284	of course you can't actually use
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0000096_0000665	underhow much of the meetings is talking about the stuff at the meetings
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0180527_0180987	so we don't sort of have to do all the work again of just like figure out stuff
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0051319_0051763	that's the cost all
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0145397_0145576	yeah exactly on the weekend
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0195472_0195877	that's good yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0197331_0197709	yeah yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0179871_0180527	it would be nice to i don't know meet up and uh you can sort of show us a bit but you know already
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0037812_0037941	even if any one thing comes up
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0018238_0018642	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0104422_0104524	yeah probably
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0029176_0029382	pushing sort of thing
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0107984_0108254	you have to convert it to some sort of format i suppose
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0102714_0102868	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0036933_0037201	so should we try to try to do a right click menu then
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0203437_0203591	now make 'em work
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0038570_0038686	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0050574_0050717	uh i'll go away
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0034102_0034749	well if you get the speak a circuitation that someone s talks a lot in uh a certain topic
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0202962_0203257	think it's up to the professor whether they did it or not
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0110616_0110841	so it's not really you know about the file things
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0206578_0206731	oh i think he basically said
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0016945_0017081	yeah that might be quite good that way
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0167730_0167888	um yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0101290_0101489	oh all the searching stuff
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0094050_0094374	yes
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0110119_0110483	what are you rating in java or yeah okay
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0168444_0168972	then we can write about it in the in the interim report and s you know then we've got something to show
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0185974_0186364	so some like that and then if i have a class i can run off and do whatever
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0022814_0022980	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0118027_0118367	the the the week as is as it is rather than the proper weeks you know
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0084719_0085603	uh i mean just to try and i mean for us to to be able to do something that we can't include with your thing so so we s yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0056935_0057083	yeah okay yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0046279_0046699	uh i don't see there's anything obvious that was that would be able you know that would be it
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0042611_0042816	actually yeah like um another comment thing
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0063546_0063967	but yeah it depends i mean uh i really wanna put the summary in somewhere you know
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0184862_0185309	well thing is you have you know something like that could happen anytime 'cause uh yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0212701_0212989	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0034749_0035495	and then if you i don't know click on that topic you'll get everything that's in that topic or whatever
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0121116_0121225	okay
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0181137_0181361	so like oh
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0173031_0173365	oh that's that's that doesn't exist
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0115078_0115204	um libraries
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0127940_0128171	okay
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0141221_0141861	actually in the moment it's got a loose a rubber because the the the barks that i used from this from you know
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0191862_0191980	have not found that yet
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0117342_0117463	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0018512_0019136	yeah yeah but um i don't know about you but usually in windows right click doesn't do anything does it
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0126718_0126828	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0073665_0073815	there's always stuff in the anyway
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0198132_0198470	that hopefully it's not that man so it won't matter
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0201280_0201698	yeah i don't think there is a physical on i don't think there was a physical one last seminar
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0012838_0013481	the problem is the r the left click is already used because it highlights that um
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0110673_0111508	and then you should look at look have a look at the the the browse page then because um you know they're already extracted for example transcripts
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0143171_0143597	another rubber but there will be cut out right at the end i think
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0155807_0156044	just to be yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0190469_0191133	exa three thirty in the in the computer room in here and then we just go st uh if you can't cannot get into the front door
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0195394_0195537	nice okay
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0019136_0019281	it opens a menu
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0184735_0184862	yeah i know
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0179135_0179603	that would probably involve rescuing the quirky language a bit as well to see what that can do
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0000872_0001183	okay
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0105467_0105681	um yeah i guess that's it
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0116729_0116852	next week some time
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0090041_0090334	um probably no
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0120733_0121028	oh
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0079997_0080387	like f full meeting meeting without this possibilities and summarise
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0066532_0066650	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0047144_0047355	um like we have the the right click menu
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0146304_0146826	um yeah yeah how many hours is this
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0175770_0175999	ah i'm not quite
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0067598_0067821	but i don't know but
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0008861_0009603	um the transcription box has got a summary b button which doesn't do anything yet
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0010620_0010958	um either we could do that you know when does a pop up come up
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0151690_0152141	so what cost is should i pick the be not doing anymore
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0064653_0064783	but it'll be good to have it there
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0091245_0091452	yeah sure
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0051126_0051364	the
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0183247_0183443	show you what bits the code
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0085854_0085988	yeah so we can plug it in and t
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0028408_0028527	or is that too much i mean
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0031855_0031976	oh well yeah i mean
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0021798_0022021	it's like more if it's visual
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0033538_0033648	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0067356_0067509	um not so yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0040143_0040498	so so this lot is for um
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0210996_0211532	and now we have seven percent of the accounts already done
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0128615_0128800	or is it just what's behind it
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0197709_0197863	okay
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0025014_0026007	um but actually what we could do is on in that menu as well we could have an option that pops up a window with all the all the meetings that that user has been in
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0045889_0046271	so the double click will do that and just save them the trouble of right clicking and choosing the item on the menu
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0024746_0024904	yes
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0195774_0196406	hey we could we could vote to copy our um assignment if we want to
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0098653_0098772	yeah so that's me then
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0128171_0128615	but wha what is it like a window where you have to r write a s search query
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0194480_0194796	because it you can also add it there's not very up or not many people in it very often
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0203347_0203466	yeah okay
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0144143_0144248	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0167893_0168151	well how about we'd get it done by then
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0198623_0198860	let's not even confirmed yet
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0175679_0176358	that's just so much fun
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0036696_0036798	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0059095_0059365	would you just say night for now and put it in
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0066650_0066792	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0092632_0092884	alright well i'll make that readable then
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0160140_0160327	you're gonna do the speech
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0000037_0000174	funci double uh
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0150839_0151060	and then it's just yeah play around with some extra stuff
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0080411_0080636	yeah do you want to do that
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0065756_0066343	so maybe you can just like choose the s same window for transcription and summary
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0033648_0034102	um i guess maybe we could have that as another thing of like
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0182467_0182780	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0176565_0177317	yeah i mean i was going to but you know the whole drop down menus and stuff what we wanna address for is not quite agreed
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0018372_0018517	everything
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0031661_0031855	when you mean the the speaker circuitration
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0079024_0079145	opposite of a becau
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0211213_0211427	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0129092_0129792	this is just when you open w you know to load the transcript for example to find the transcript for certain meeting
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0127795_0128003	very clearly yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0139133_0139328	push the digit i was just thinking that yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0026135_0026438	like a search for that user
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0095954_0096182	and it's called the emulator
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0041033_0041181	and then this is on
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0109389_0109550	okay
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0181028_0181137	oh just like the basic
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0119796_0120427	it w it was it wasn't mar but it was i had to sit and think about it for a bit but is a bit irrelevant
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0052198_0052354	because i think it might do something
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0162062_0162239	actually it's just diagonal acts
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0144045_0144630	okay get over that next to s
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0210862_0210996	hello
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0031547_0031789	or what can i give us in the browsing
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0072615_0073007	yeah that would reduce the number of um windows we needed wouldn't it
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0126161_0126273	that is
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0160037_0160177	search
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0003404_0003804	good start
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0040691_0040809	on the speaker
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0192004_0192373	how do we take a a two
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0018302_0018699	so otherwise we just have a right click to do
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0096404_0096606	lowercase
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0153901_0154781	and then i'm doing parallel programming languages and systems which we had one exercise as well and that's in like friday
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0208436_0208731	you really want multiple windows from a single app
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0209467_0209577	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0177666_0177789	alright it's true
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0013878_0014055	the the left click or the right key
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0197125_0197320	so after the new l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0045291_0045449	like and just think it to have the default there
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0071604_0071899	well a different way we can do it it doesn't don't have to be a tap or whatever
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0190727_0190876	actually we can't get in there though
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0105647_0105801	so you think it shouldn't be too difficult
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0107796_0107929	oh i see
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0173310_0173625	okay
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0202080_0202399	some classes did and some classes didn't
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0024560_0025014	in the battery box
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0094981_0095082	so that they're in o. four
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0142647_0142936	missing critical o
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0101141_0101294	what what are you doing again
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0193087_0193279	just for bang on it
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0145448_0145854	we can
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0185309_0185690	like my schedule is like a class a break class a break you know that sort of thing
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0115704_0115871	uh okay a make sense
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0091303_0091783	well it's no but the thing is if you're looking if you can check them both um you wanna see all the results
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0038013_0038142	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0113350_0113593	so maybe it comes with something clearer as well
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0112878_0113350	as i said you know if you if you left click on something for example it highlights automatically
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0032508_0032636	oh i see
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0133510_0133859	so then it just goes through and says uh if this word equals that don't print
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0077159_0077621	um there is but i haven't made a lot of changes to it
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0138826_0139583	you can write we can write something like um we'll try and do on the fly and and observe if if that gonna is gonna take too long
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0031677_0031881	was there anything else we wanted to add to the time line
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0089209_0089625	yeah it's uh-huh
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0023970_0024180	is it only gonna tell us we got it wrong anyway
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0045428_0046024	we uh say we are still aiming for the mm development to be completely in the market awaits or so
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0126120_0126533	but that will mean that you can only do things on actually now because you need things on wood level
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0161805_0161922	exa yeah that makes sense
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0172114_0172473	yeah okay actually no not actually that's a good idea i take one quick look over
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0125789_0125942	then right into a group to a final
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0136598_0136789	see this probably that's probably not that's more difficult
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0065557_0065912	oh mean with the intention that this is done
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0175251_0175396	oh no
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0023249_0023358	yes
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0143725_0143963	don't know don't we don't wanna have to do that right
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0136789_0136955	you just inc fan the code out a bit
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0156582_0157089	but yeah just i don't know it just it doesn't make any difference really either to me
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0099364_0099946	just that it's hard to tell what kind of object it was originally once it's put into like a list box or something
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0082502_0083092	or do we want them all in one page with like an icon or a different colour or something to indicate what type of result they are
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0034821_0035259	that's no i don't th that's that's too big yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0033101_0033591	probably wanna think about if we wanna change our goals and stuff
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0071456_0071927	search through those and and then just you can that will tell us what advantages it's got
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0130301_0130473	it would just be a blob like a summary
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0018936_0019111	so it's not even relevant
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0121635_0121783	yeah that's true yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0023513_0023630	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0126624_0126989	yeah if we're gonna do the excel file then find that's that'll probably makes it easier
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0064215_0064651	yeah my intent is to break on these things tomorrow a bit more
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0174290_0174848	okay we're changing the dial back
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0106955_0107583	um yeah i mean um at the moment it works it works with highlighting in in the transcript window doesn't it
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0034973_0035184	now
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0085733_0086046	um so it'll be on the circuit window bottom half of the circuit window
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0085080_0085345	what's uh kind of what are you thinking
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0032460_0032772	well that's that's your disc this is a regular one
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0169934_0170046	maybe a sleep
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0068274_0068805	um i think uh i was wondering about that is uh i haven't looked at it so much
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0169706_0169850	oh
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0087384_0087866	and um so if we wanna do it that way yeah like it probably doesn't matter too much
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0171724_0172114	okay i c i can yeah if you want to send them to me that's fine
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0045439_0045574	speaking directory analysis
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0047298_0047592	give me a week and i'll tell you the answer to that
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0021454_0021977	um so no if there's other stuff that you think should be done to this i could do that before i mail it to you guys
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0091653_0091831	actually mm yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0042375_0042600	the circuit file on target or something
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0164101_0164355	so i think bullet p bullet points
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0047576_0047898	like should we put it a hint that something like that might happen into the document
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0058470_0058757	well if we're skipping the audio one then then things like that easier
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0042968_0043351	the plus plus minus three days yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0175396_0175540	uh
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0098888_0099364	thinking sometimes in a case like that like i run across um y in other languages
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0128989_0129377	so i guess just displaying it is alright
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0132233_0133122	it's just another um i mean these meetings are not endlessly long it's just words and to print all of them out selectively
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0144569_0145137	they gave up to n uh night stuff 'cause it was much much more easier
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0111951_0112094	um some
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0174199_0174381	yeah it's like now
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0084213_0084627	well at the moment is there at the moment is there a window that comes up
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0018829_0018936	but that didn't stop on this page
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0159237_0159400	it's just uh it's just a full loop really
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0132149_0132290	oh
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0094978_0095288	and i mean essentially they're temp yeah in time order
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0131930_0132233	uh i don't think it's gonna take long to to produce anyway
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0144731_0144890	okay
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0136955_0137127	it would be the same thing
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0171687_0171790	what
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0083744_0083850	yeah yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0160891_0161131	yeah i included the future work in my own section
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0041252_0041505	um m meet these mailboxes uh yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0078856_0079508	except you say that you'd written something that maybe have cost some bugs and that you were gonna fix those on the weekend or something
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0024853_0025092	uh i think it's
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0076781_0077134	so w is there um did you d have you made another another emulator
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0133236_0133358	it does on the fly anyway didn't it
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0118569_0118766	anybody
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0035247_0035573	uh think that's gonna be a we don't even know how to approach that at the moment i think
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0121016_0121339	transcur no 'cause then we need all the other data if we wanna keep it in a transformer right
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0048189_0048321	yeah that's right
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0059565_0059750	now not that this possibilities
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0026408_0026675	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0135590_0136024	print it on both both pens and if it's not a proper word then print only on one
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0047485_0047593	oh yeah oh
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0129316_0129464	that's fine
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0028436_0028592	he never got a
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0110572_0111480	yeah i mean the whole um the what fills the transmission box and all of these boxes is a special sort of pain made by night
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0041751_0041938	oh mean we haven't really yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0161282_0162274	that just said i said what i'd done so far and what i'm gonna do and some pr some issues uh then that was
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0161522_0161681	yeah well maybe you could
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0029731_0030110	actually i noticed that no one is
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0174089_0174996	okay
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0044006_0044251	conceptsively
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0092292_0092417	maybe yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0091839_0091961	yeah yeah it's three points
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0034547_0034909	that's what i thought as well i mean do we are we are we actually gonna attempt that
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0046016_0046324	it's speaky characterised basically it's supposed to be done already
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0138184_0138407	you know the top file then you don't ever have to produce it
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0015707_0015897	exa yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0046502_0047118	it um is is one of those something that you wanna change and delete from our list of expectations
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0041758_0041920	like you know develop a prototype
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0024180_0024754	uh a really good job
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0176364_0176543	oh oh okay
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0151304_0151743	because just seems like a little tuning here and there and just adding a couple things
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0112214_0112478	um no i don't know what it's called
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0017785_0018043	like the thing is i was thinking even in the stuff that i was doing i mean
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0130473_0130975	it won't look like it won't say speaker six says this speaker wire says that speaker has uh this
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0048321_0048439	uh i i really wanna do it
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0095725_0095842	yeah maybe we should do that
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0172473_0172728	try and get it as good as i think that way yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0023859_0023970	uh yeah it's okay yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0150225_0150542	just to get things i don't know moving at a higher level i guess
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0116540_0116682	okay
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0124910_0125118	now not store it at all whatever
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0088813_0089409	now just just paints just for export pains for each of the three no no no no no no no
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0056905_0057415	should we i don't know would think mike about our things that we had together
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0016742_0017526	yeah we could this could be just some uh a little just just described some screen shots or something
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0127290_0127571	we're not gonna do much more than just look at the
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0079643_0079886	after the weekend
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0125942_0126120	the computer you say it would never be done
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0158908_0159085	yeah it's after it's later on
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0053740_0054016	should we change the details
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0132163_0132382	then i don't i don't think that's i think that's true
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0063158_0063436	so i wanna get something i wanna see this i wanna get it together
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0173283_0173628	purely a functionality
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0065968_0066281	uh it is not he'll hopefully a little bit
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0141101_0141775	flip it into uh yeah just um transforms um like um the l. c. d. um the excel sheet
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0025799_0025919	uh have lots of time tonight
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0137251_0138184	you know the the b the good way of doing it um not together is that you if someone doesn't wanna look at the the
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0164381_0164747	because if you have a conservative thing here and then another discussion thing there it
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0149964_0150225	and the other inches they could give us
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0028943_0029179	look then s
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0114691_0114955	text area or something like that yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0109343_0109760	think it's just like as long as we implement one of these interfaces for this particular type of window
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0039384_0039848	we prefer to concentrate on the main b
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0074504_0074606	two poles or something yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0023630_0023745	that's a good idea
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0152397_0153316	it should be conceptual and you know coming up with the the brilliant ideas and then just yeah bringing those to reality
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0079969_0080142	okay cool
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0103329_0103842	um yeah it's just like from past experience i've there's goofy little things that happen
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0168522_0168675	so part from that yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0176882_0177179	oh
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0175983_0176353	um yeah in twelve thirty with
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0029595_0030227	so
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0028668_0028943	are you just leave your computer on maybe
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0081582_0082029	um like if we have topics as well as trans scripts as well as what is the other
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0109120_0109343	um wasn't jordan saying something about that
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0030764_0031418	yeah do what you wanna do with it first and then i'll yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0131287_0131598	and then it would look ugly probably 'cause it would look just black and white
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0086485_0086802	so so it's just like you click those and it's just loads up
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0069665_0070203	like also in in the extract time stamps and stuff so we can is it
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0047900_0048145	maybe the speech characterisation may get slimmer
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0031329_0031464	actually um
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0029280_0029409	yeah so maybe
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0145900_0146161	okay
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0071927_0072435	and then you could either do it automatically or you can just hard code and say look get me any the time stamps
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0169683_0170405	yeah maybe a slight
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0062365_0063158	it should at you know at least very least have um a gooey and uh wire it'll be wiring that in hopefully tomorrow
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0104204_0104330	well have a lot
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0164747_0165061	if they're not together you lose a lot of um the continuity i think
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0092417_0092558	yeah that's true
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0129377_0129503	but uh well anyway yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0135186_0135590	so if certain you know if it's a proper word
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0032636_0032810	oh this is the one that okay
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0163372_0163537	think th that does make sense
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0049921_0050095	yeah but we might not you know
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0147522_0147857	like just to see h what they what system they use to develop this stuff
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0055519_0055766	the more detailed specifically
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0109760_0110058	we should be able to have that highlighting happen
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0051363_0051551	okay
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0106677_0106952	or details or whatever uh
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0147168_0147522	actually i think i might try to talk to who is a journalist and jean
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0114635_0114909	uh don't know text text yeah some another
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0094497_0094659	how do we wanna order them in the first place
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0027526_0027739	oh yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0174848_0174986	oh
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0079847_0079969	right
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0105308_0105835	because you're working with an event handler within the one panel or a list box or whatever it is
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0162852_0163194	uh sometimes it's easy to have the top i in its own intentions if you so i mean
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0064651_0065348	so i don't know w we sent it in on the afternoon maybe i can add a few sentences to one of my own
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0147857_0148685	could be nice to have all the tools there and just like have the object model and just kind of like plug in play with everything and just to actually use a system
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0014147_0014312	oh yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0046324_0046575	yeah it takes away
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0158643_0158795	but it has already loaded it anyway
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0131677_0131891	it's probably best than do as you said
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0084148_0084359	or three like sub sums sort of
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0031135_0031257	let's have a tea
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0131891_0132149	like just like yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0026045_0026664	um and then i'll we'll send it to you and you can do the final revisions
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0120335_0121016	like not even not as x. m. l. just sort of as a was that what is that what is that
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0106952_0107083	so there is
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0168840_0169092	we'll have a sleep anyway
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0143107_0143373	but uh that might even be an easier way
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0027533_0027852	oh now you're always on line
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0089503_0089859	so so this is when we click you know topics and summaries for what we want to search
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0067581_0067962	well i still like struggling with a j. bar stuff
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0141775_0142195	and then it's kinda like there's usually things built in to well it should be built into java
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0055764_0056002	well you could put you know yeah i don't know
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0154087_0154810	yeah why don't you put both of both of those ideas in into that that package and say you'll have a look at both or something
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0090467_0090932	um but then you can't see all of them at the same time and it's just like
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0057638_0057891	think so yeah like yeah conventional
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0004581_0004696	oh make funny drawings
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0172761_0173069	oh mean the feedback yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0176443_0176700	it's it's tivo
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0075640_0075774	that is it uh twenty anyway
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0124458_0124617	yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0094729_0094978	but i think yeah probably by meeting makes most sense
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0031257_0031387	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0115991_0116432	night object model i think that's why it
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0121398_0121828	it will very much limit what you can do with it if it is not an excel format that's a problem
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0171979_0172091	so in i don't know
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0059545_0059671	uh the display okay
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0013743_0013850	okay yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0115317_0115547	yeah why it wants a norm anyway
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0071209_0071456	it requires a lot of equipment
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0053774_0054353	we should probably d sorry we should probably do another responsibility of packages as well
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0012313_0012414	oh like the time mine
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0093986_0094497	yeah well i mean if you know that's uh y even the second step the first question is do we want to order that
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0162560_0162760	we might lose a bit of convenience if you do that though
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0024214_0024440	but
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0045213_0045428	and you can say yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0056791_0056905	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0162054_0162383	um i'll like into each so i don't yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0042654_0042791	more or less hmm
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0154810_0154970	if you wanna do it
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0104599_0105080	so if you wanna go to the actual high light the transcript or highlight the topic or i like the summary
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0121828_0122215	there is some design method that puts things back into the email format
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0018560_0018829	oh yes c yeah on actually uh i had that at the very end screen shots
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0118766_0119675	because um i'm wondering how we're gonna write it back to h. t. m. l. i mean x. m. l. if we take if we did the processing
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0008661_0008947	everyone's looking down reading
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0065842_0065968	they're the coffee machine
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0093620_0094088	oh yeah i guess that was the other thing whether we wanna have a s re order by columns and all that
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0162274_0162383	think at least it c
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0041627_0041784	you have should have a section probably
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0020013_0020117	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0168333_0168547	so it's good
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0152034_0152305	oh no it shouldn't be no
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0093846_0093986	how to order it
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0023125_0023329	uh no production right
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0103842_0104599	and just doesn't let you save certain things and it's just gonna um trying to to do a different kind of to go to a different window
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0078362_0078473	so that's friday i think
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0115547_0115719	night oh
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0059750_0059870	woah
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0139583_0140140	if it's gonna take too long well think about writing it to a file and doing it off line
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0162278_0162642	yeah like here is what we've done already and then you know down here
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0048321_0048484	okay
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0060166_0060504	and don't know if we have time to look at that before tomorrow
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0025267_0025508	oh
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0077134_0077273	is there something that i should
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0148685_0148921	you had a higher level better than 'kay
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0072435_0073145	so you just say um get audience and put i think is i think the method of could get audience and this is called standard time and end time
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0014437_0014850	um i'm not sure if we need the entire line of the prototype
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0153323_0153432	that's the higher people
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0174381_0174703	that's another one
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0023358_0023660	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0036715_0036928	yeah yeah that's alright
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0087255_0087384	once you check and uh
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0003990_0004240	like could take notes at this time i guess
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0149408_0149827	so i made uh try to contact them so if there's oh no
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0060504_0060724	we could just make it up and
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0102270_0102935	rock bottom l. level saying if th if you found a segment then colour it print it in red or whatever and
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0125288_0125530	yeah that's w that's why i think we like
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0003703_0003815	okay
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0012730_0013102	so it's all whatever in academic yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0015004_0015184	well just sort of well the thing is yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0142195_0142837	mean to process x. m. l. and uh like i ch just just creates whatever file it's gonna be in
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0075776_0075883	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0128644_0128816	since we're not doing the audio thing
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0059159_0059383	have you taken any more of a look at it
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0087866_0088246	just trying to think if there's gonna be any other issues down the road um depending on
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0089021_0089334	okay not not three different okay yeah okay cool
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0130120_0130471	could a text file take the digital signal out of the text file and yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0079699_0079847	oh yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0061496_0061766	have you managed any further on the switch thing
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0170268_0170525	still mm-hmm
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0078524_0078671	but i will tonight that's the point
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0067239_0067390	for the t integrated file
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0156430_0156582	target file x. m. l. or whatever it is
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0018043_0018395	just throw the screen shots in there when you talk about what you're doing right
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0044869_0045188	okay
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0086849_0086950	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0127716_0128450	the rem like the the text will remove these electronics 'cause we're not gonna search it and we're not gonna like listening to it
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0125664_0125902	that's sort of what we are thinking before
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0048678_0049161	if at least have all the information pop up that is already in the meta data file
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0036788_0037258	let's we d unless we discover some sort of time warp thing it's not gonna happen
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0164968_0165091	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0038266_0038901	and say yeah we didn't we decided the the time is too short oh well
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0101561_0101936	if you if you do it straight from you know you get l you get the result
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0119829_0119979	writing it back to luxam
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0029410_0029595	but i'm never on line on the morning
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0083092_0083471	so that when they you know click on that it's gonna go to the relevant thing
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0140051_0140536	it's just uh they're just be a f statement when they're very fast in state of mind
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0022984_0023725	think about panellis should do it
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0025658_0025799	uh i'm happy to do some as well
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0157956_0158182	especially with java and the l. c. r.
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0013822_0013944	okay
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0020117_0020934	 anyways so um so you have this just very general structure um i guess from this we can just pop in our little brackets and and uh
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0157402_0157749	um that's about the only issue i have with on the fly whether it's fast enough
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0036472_0036842	should have we had more time this is what we would have done
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0148921_0149202	playing around with a little bit of code and modifying their code and doing this and that
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0123724_0123835	yeah like
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0058396_0058593	should we let us
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0120575_0120691	that's a blop of text
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0042132_0042351	exactly
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0101496_0101599	where is it coming from
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0107851_0108601	and think he was saying that as long as we implement that um interface um it should work with anything that we do
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0077621_0077969	so i might just um delete what i've done and copy into yours
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0146596_0146733	are we serious
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0115208_0115321	mostly things are called norm
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0153159_0153266	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0008166_0008661	very interesting start of the meeting
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0074447_0074908	yeah that's on the uh the n the the the norm rate elements
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0044105_0044380	and so i've only got six days to do the topic segments which is for
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0037281_0037580	yeah but that's definitely one thing we could just remove
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0078539_0078676	how about you said okay
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0060724_0061147	like i'll claim one you claim the other for the search things and then we could leave that one as a a joint one
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0125902_0126033	actually but this makes more sense
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0012470_0012730	actually for that i was just copying the one straight out to the other document
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0023725_0023859	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0021247_0021366	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0134183_0134337	just the buttons of statistics is
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0031881_0032249	mean they essentially was what like um you can't see either that
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0036107_0036226	could be future work thing isn't it
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0174996_0175109	that's good
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0098204_0098433	yeah b why don't you just um
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0027739_0028052	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0171516_0171724	or do you want to or no
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0079598_0079699	oh
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0129404_0129617	yeah yeah you don't really need to do much more with it
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0138300_0138507	and they can yeah exactly
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0163537_0164018	but maybe at the end maybe just a a point form of you know things that we're still working on things that will do
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0028865_0029045	he presented
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0140531_0141101	that is just thinking as well i mean we could probably use like x. l. t. to kinda just transform it and yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0060478_0060694	yeah it might be yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0143934_0144261	uh wouldn't wanna have to put it take put it back into extra mode with a
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0086802_0087255	you still split that thing into like two or three or whatever it is one to two and a ten on which
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0033591_0034574	uh think it um one thing that we could probably skip uh totally is the removing things from the audio files
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0049366_0049523	so it's definitely gonna be something there
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0121631_0121738	yeah that's true
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0079506_0079643	now
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0153441_0153811	oh no
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0126896_0127147	mean we're not really uh well i mean
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0144532_0144657	um
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0038837_0039136	or we thought there are more important things to do with our time than
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0036226_0036472	take in the conclusion the final report
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0064860_0065078	well
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0018395_0018519	the can i access it
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0105335_0105452	yeah yeah you can imagine
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0161799_0161936	maybe you could split that up and
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0039295_0039468	that will worry about
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0023745_0024214	let's just cut out the middle man you just yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0048439_0048678	and i mean it's not it's not gonna be difficult
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0175540_0175983	are there like four lines uh or whatever
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0159496_0159838	whether it runs out of memory
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0015441_0015688	yeah because i mean that's basically what we're doing here isn't it
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0028261_0028966	slaves live
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0154970_0155409	uh i i personally don't wanna mess with uh right in files or anything at the moment
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0079886_0080250	the week in was out
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0019391_0020010	but you can still have screen shots by the thing each one or um have just a bunch of 'em in one section
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0174099_0174290	okay
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0113936_0114207	it's a nice text paint or something isn't it
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0036594_0036788	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0005954_0006231	um actually you can just take that if you want
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0043505_0043786	that's true uh
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0146289_0147004	you have to start defining object models like the night thing and getting uh with our wide things
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0025379_0025658	yeah well i mean it's up to you if you wanna keep going with that
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0042719_0042856	yeah put it it's a good idea
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0013926_0014135	um is it
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0115533_0115991	the nice object i think
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0083471_0083998	like just if they kick all three say topics summary bob rooba have three different windows come up
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0065078_0065557	well it's well it doesn't really matter i mean you can write the sentences first as well
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0119968_0120335	it's i thought we were just going to have that as words
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0049534_0049781	yeah we don't make it disappear but we might tilt it down a bit
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0163194_0163417	so you talk about speak circuits and you say we'd done the
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0123311_0123783	oh select what we want just take bits of the excel file ta only you take certain segments
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0093080_0093213	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0163985_0164101	tools or something
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0059749_0059852	okay
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0090755_0090862	all of them now
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0057891_0058016	yeah exactly
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0125458_0125580	it says something different there
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0100175_0100452	and then if we're highlighting something in a transcript window
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0041920_0042435	we we c you know oh yeah we manage that nicely uh
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0089859_0090212	then it'll loo yeah there'll be two result paints silvered
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0046238_0046442	now really
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0092178_0092282	yeah exactly
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0057650_0058070	mean we have now like inverted and you have the other but what about them
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0066537_0066801	we'll do this until it's all falls together
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0114909_0115049	the li yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0066825_0067239	how about the unfolding data for it
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0016792_0016898	so that's something we have to
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0151881_0152103	that's what programming is all about i'm afraid
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0150688_0151137	seems to be more interesting to use it as a a real developer would
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0093213_0093492	and mean we could we could offer them by meeting for example
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0054833_0054945	right
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0050130_0050484	yeah they might turn out easier than thought
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0090405_0090683	yeah i quite like the idea of a tap in that case
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0123113_0123303	so as as opposed to
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0101260_0101496	so let's that's yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0144261_0144569	even trying to read it in the x. m. l. but double is complicated enough
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0125531_0125664	yeah i know
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0026675_0027547	uh look at it like uh when my usual working hours are like from twelve o'clock to three four o'clock till three four o'clock or something
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0113476_0113968	okay maybe i should maybe i should use that as well in more yeah okay
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0178273_0178394	for the prices a right yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0055312_0055519	that's essentially the same as it was
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0065912_0066273	and also some sometimes it's a bit of a modifying factor too
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0170405_0170552	the in
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0124313_0124485	at the moment it prints out all of them
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0043351_0043505	yeah that's that that that's true too
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0051348_0051744	it just needs to be done because you mean the ca yeah tune yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0114147_0114464	now i'm not sure it doesn't look paint in it
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0131598_0131725	and this you want it to dock colourful
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0105878_0106013	oh oh i see yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0040496_0041100	and i think we should probably um comment explicitly on the mailstations here as well and say we managed to do
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0164255_0164357	now maybe
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0115049_0115317	now text there is alright
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0042801_0043608	uh-huh well uh-huh
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0118130_0118569	the removing the disfluencies have you done anything with that yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0031418_0031794	and i'll send that out to you again so whatever
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0044331_0044624	oh that's pretty much
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0174493_0174669	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0019159_0019391	yeah you can either have th yeah it's the screen shot there and stuff
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0080142_0080966	um yeah so if you all those are stuff out there that actually i'm gonna try to minimise the amount of change in terms of make it a chrome anyway
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0105080_0105308	at that point that's sort of we're just getting a little bit tricky
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0145518_0145969	oh well as it gonna be is turbo or try to do that it was just so complicated it was ridiculous
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0063436_0063952	have an image in my mind and i just wanna see it on the thing and then can make a screen shot
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0086046_0086485	um i don't know we still wanna keep it that way but that's uh that's what i'm gonna be working with
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0125286_0125531	okay then that's that that's not yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0175109_0175452	have enough use my pen
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0084835_0085080	or is our you know it's wooden get larger
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0173304_0173568	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0090212_0090467	one for topics one for i don't no really tabs
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0041160_0041286	that's this and that's it
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0160386_0160730	so should we all write um a later or two about future work as well
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0051551_0051685	turned i guess you're got it
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0044624_0045064	you don't have any uh l. c. m. l. p. assignments yet
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0042609_0042719	yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0101936_0102270	and then there's a some if statement saying s straight on the you know
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0173660_0174199	and correct back any like things that i thought was wrong in english or whatever
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0035738_0036107	it's a good thing to have to say we ca what we could have done if we had more time
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0136024_0136232	but i mean that's that's you know fancy but
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0140536_0140696	let's it's loads of its own
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0035060_0035247	i don't think so either yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0096204_0096458	should be an easy m oh sorry actually
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0054353_0054961	that's what he indicated that we should also um indicate who who is responsible for what from now on
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0051744_0052069	uh search for the parameters bas man or something
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0096458_0096585	should be fairly easy i guess
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0169707_0170268	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0098797_0099022	the results to to the different colours
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0078221_0078524	not since you looked at it last no
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0044380_0044595	just a s
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0140401_0140531	profit and
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0153855_0154032	oh a front it too
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0136952_0137075	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0054984_0055312	well i could probably just copy that straight out to the other one as well
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0021977_0022293	um otherwise no
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0088442_0088847	do you have um three separate windows for the three separate different types of results
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0058775_0059373	yeah we just keep it together on the the paper there right now and just see what what
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0018361_0018535	yeah you can either have or we can just ignore that bit
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0106358_0106545	you you have to use actions
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0145283_0145518	so we can do it with nice stuff do whatever you want i think
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0173065_0173652	and then send it on to us so that we can nod
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0058351_0058470	oh
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0014850_0015021	uh mean what what we're gonna put into that
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0078676_0078817	oh right i see
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0082114_0082502	um do we want separate result paints uh for each of those
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0073145_0073437	um and then i'll tell you the start times at the end times
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0050095_0050312	depends how how how how how these p
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0122353_0122857	uh mean i thought we'd we'd just selectively selectively eliminate the exam that we've got
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0143963_0144215	although on the fly it's too big it's it's too basically pretty fun
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0090855_0091354	but you wouldn't want to compare the result the pop the topic one topic result would you
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0095959_0096134	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0058198_0058396	it's just removing these two l. c. d. s
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0143373_0143725	and then that way we could even process that before hand
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0029691_0030275	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0030488_0030619	so i'll send it after you
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0022293_0022953	um did someone else wanna throw together actually i can probably still draw out together if you want um put your parts into into this one
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0029133_0029280	yeah right
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0175479_0175581	uh have
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0032249_0032460	cheers here's the old one
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0052069_0052298	let's see what happens
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0155409_0155526	oh wanna do it separately
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0168547_0168840	anything else anyone wants to talk about
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0164930_0165079	yeah maybe a right
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0176873_0177267	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0037935_0038266	but put it under changes since the initial specification
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0067962_0068274	um yeah but i'll work on it
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0055240_0055341	yeah pretty much
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0108601_0108763	like highlighting oh yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0124801_0124917	okay yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0112478_0112878	and that comes with a whole lot of highlighting extras as well
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0020888_0020992	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0129704_0130120	but thing is like it well how would we display uh like if we take this electronics out and just c you know
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0085039_0085733	what um i think what we sorta discussed last week is to have it sort on the same window
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0016426_0016728	and so just saying that you know we could potentially do that
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0134416_0135016	you could nearly do it together with with the the transcription with the original transcript and have them run parallel
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0123720_0124313	yeah only only print out certain um certain segments the sections that we want just selectively
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0021313_0021454	exactly
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0115367_0115504	yeah why
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0032772_0033027	yeah yeah which is just copied straight out
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0109010_0109145	what do you mean it should work with anyway
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0095288_0095598	so yeah that kind of makes more sense
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0153316_0153441	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0106024_0106677	so um there are ways around it but you know whether i'll be able to figure something out like that till before tomorrow yeah i know
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0061780_0062365	um i found finally today something that i can build it in and it uh i should have something for tomorrow
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0157089_0157402	it's like if it's fast enough on the fly then sure
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0015184_0015707	we're gonna be touching on all that during the other part for the progress and putting screen shots and all the rest yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0059383_0059545	have you taken any more of a look at it
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0138548_0138826	so but i mean you can you know
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0066273_0066537	and then you write down the words and the ideas that's oh okay
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0049161_0049366	that's gonna be no work at all
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0108763_0109120	think that was some who was saying that
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0142837_0143107	uh it's been a f couple of years since i've looked into anything like this
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0172091_0172338	it doesn't matter for me either
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0004495_0004612	exactly this
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0002480_0002851	he who wants to take notes today
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0041286_0041566	or some of them are a bit later somewhere yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0146180_0146289	don't believe it
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0130967_0131486	unless we extract that out of the file when we create the text file
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0024443_0024853	and i'm being like oh no not uh and they'd speak of english
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0020992_0021379	have rid of the top component one
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0068805_0069665	but if any you guys know how we could do the like from the uh extract words that you did
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0088240_0088442	what have th s uh you confuse me
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0074908_0075230	that c that the e the object is a normal right element i think
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0099946_0100175	it's hard to tell whether it was a a transmitter or whatever
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0100452_0101260	it may be difficult to get that information back once it's just in a list box and item in a list box
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0178394_0178659	that must be alright anyway
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0081248_0081582	actually just to clarify last week when we're talking about our search results
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0171165_0171447	or or shall just take she can take it from now
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0057415_0057650	should we i mean now yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0038504_0038624	we don't think that's enough time
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0077969_0078306	because i'm sorry you've probably made some changes already
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0015897_0016426	well it was just something that he had mentioned in the um in the previous like just to sort of have a prototype together
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0032386_0032508	oh there's more
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0030110_0030238	then it's alright
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0149202_0149408	it'd be nice to just sorta see what they're doing
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0058979_0059114	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0124485_0124910	we'll just put an elephant in it that leaves out some of the print statements
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0026408_0026889	th you can you can protect it and then uh
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0074139_0074374	so then i could just put it in some
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0111480_0111676	so i'm not sure what it's called now
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0048322_0048580	probably we won't disappear it yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0004240_0004381	will take notes tonight i guess
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0164018_0164192	oh yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0155864_0156372	like the thing that i was thinking there is well is it once it's done for f you know one meeting it's done and it's there
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0037097_0037360	the t. v. yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0122144_0122353	why do why do we wanna in the email there
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0158182_0158649	it's if it's loading the file and doing all the rest and processing then
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0027852_0028436	it always makes me feel bad because uh when i go to bed it like one you're still on mine
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0094088_0094233	but that's a half too
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0050861_0051348	the top segmentation with uh l. c. d. screens basically done
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0084627_0084835	or is that a a second result pain
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0117869_0117982	but the um
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0091831_0092168	especially if you get if you get results for the same meeting
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0118453_0118825	yeah but the okay the global one feeds into the local
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0047777_0048030	that would be the easiest way to uh yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0187875_0188443	yeah just to give them an idea a general idea what there is and so they can pick a a t um uh meeting
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0055476_0055829	then i could use that for the for the topic pop up window
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0249998_0250371	we've all got cl well three of us have to class a twelve
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0249215_0249491	maybe i dec i'm not sure i'll do this again
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0254887_0254996	okay
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0023520_0024002	so um i have you already calculated this data or are you supposed to do that
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0005496_0005698	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0079726_0079893	you mean the h highlighting stuff
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0252592_0252753	like you know five or six
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0053683_0053812	well that yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0099083_0099438	welcome so the uh that then it's a deer browser
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0134197_0134354	oh do they do they replace them
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0225023_0225259	actually this doesn't oh let's do that then
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0197610_0198058	besides what they did the last time
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0140243_0140790	if somebody is done the keys or uh the the c. d. f. s already would be not too probab
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0213265_0213415	oh i see what you mean
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0025463_0025733	and then or just call it one at a time to pop up the window
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0103783_0103949	oh should
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0070272_0070386	so it's good
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0124048_0124307	ten different meetings you know w the word wireless comes up
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0051055_0051227	right
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0235796_0236117	could not write right articles
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0127554_0128257	and then you can uh know the option is to do a search in the way that you d if you do a global search
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0287945_0288070	tick
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0237959_0238103	it tells you what
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0278313_0278617	like we're just looking for the two words separately if they exist in the same document
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0201912_0202445	and just i don't know just playing around with ideas
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0028802_0028920	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0282399_0282559	oh how do you rank them or something
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0147353_0147533	well the corpus yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0265828_0266434	now but for things like if you search for a language then you might have you have some topics which have as a
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0184560_0184752	okay
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0213415_0213551	inside the circuit board yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0157347_0157497	yeah yeah definitely
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0069110_0069420	well i won't take very long to get it all finished up then
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0125139_0125328	since it's not it's not too bad on that
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0103036_0103596	at the moment the way is it's a it's a drop down menu as you've seen
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0057373_0057710	the um a lot of people don't give their age in on the stuff
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0099438_0100082	just some uh some speech and some music remote controls
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0068607_0068783	oh mean is m yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0088289_0089001	ten documents or we're gonna have to load each of these ten corpora just to um do the individual next uh an extra search
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0247021_0247144	but that means it's right after
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0060210_0060321	so it doesn't crash the thing
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0090150_0090373	are we serious
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0049224_0049723	so each time are you going straight to the excel files for for the information or or
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0176931_0177652	but if it's sort of like uh if the advanced t. series just still got to be run to find these terms or these you know these patterns then uh
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0042950_0043546	because at the moment i'm using there is there are methods that say um f the for our use for other tools
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0236758_0236869	oh really
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0149838_0149964	in this document
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0164818_0164960	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0160488_0160600	ranking it once like down
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0053812_0053941	uh that you c
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0109093_0109356	can you not get this num object um
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0223637_0223889	that i think in that
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0255898_0256003	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0050258_0050422	right okay
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0132681_0132824	better than names for the meetings
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0225317_0225963	yeah i'm not sure what uh that is that very is not annoying if you have to hold 'em you
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0047715_0047843	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0050561_0050671	yes it's our present us
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0208441_0208990	just said one so one said take me straight to this meeting and have a text book you can enter it or drop down menu
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0218519_0218657	in the case that we do want to drop down
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0174008_0174408	and that generally it will be a bit curved but it will give you a score
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0272402_0272761	yeah i mean you'd just do a really simple you know
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0053116_0053476	or is it just like individual ones like one f one object for okay
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0028342_0028849	and i mean search results if they're all in a productive thing with a name certain properties are limited properties
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0226994_0227437	wait for it to pop up all the amounts of that will wait a bit um
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0044823_0045043	um in the same for that i mean so that
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0256612_0256834	yeah no we should probably do that at the end but yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0203527_0203630	then do this pop up
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0118903_0119072	yeah i mean the logo
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0209204_0209467	it looked up the search engine
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0143073_0143304	how do you do it in environmental sensors without the t. f. t.
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0162209_0162322	three
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0130824_0131060	yeah that makes sense
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0276514_0276625	so you can i see that
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0098398_0098686	what kind of star screen do we want
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0063528_0063805	thought the other stuff was more important anyway so i did that first
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0281597_0281750	yeah i think so
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0241644_0241921	um not really just gonna keep on going
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0069766_0069924	because otherwise the objects won't be the same
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0200239_0200457	what was that
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0135159_0135296	uh i'll i'll love that
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0268832_0269419	for multiple times unless you wanna do something there will be a way of doing it for multiple tapes
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0168814_0168924	so i don't know
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0119439_0119572	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0124836_0125272	and i mean that's gonna that could be yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0056795_0057141	no topic specific uh i have a default yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0037082_0037710	it's speaker speaker is the uh controlling thing not yeah yeah okay yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0063527_0063800	oh yeah definitely
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0172193_0172508	and then then it's just saying were these two words in any of these documents
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0198795_0199338	well alright call it favourites then 'kay
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0228698_0229192	maybe just leave it just have them leading names there and don't worry about the speakers
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0135332_0135852	okay i wanna see the meeting is about be different better understood
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0260848_0261428	oh well basically not not unless you've got time for it at the end
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0138314_0138521	imagine the d. f. s
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0161177_0161402	yeah yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0089380_0089533	yeah i think probably yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0061353_0061562	because they're just for the mate the the
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0281671_0281788	woah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0171413_0171547	how would you combine the last question
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0150429_0150823	it did do it once i do have a curve that it does it for something i don't know whether it will work for this
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0208152_0208271	yeah it will search yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0133108_0133838	we can probably do that ourselves and just sort of beep d. b. you don't just do a a string kinda
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0167133_0167654	basically all of the meetings you wanna see where they actually spoke about it and where they just mentioned it at once
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0258709_0259136	um we discussed if the circuit should be wrapped
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0157189_0157624	because you don't have to integrate as much information
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0131060_0131406	and that way if they know specifically which meeting it is then that'll save the time
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0070656_0070793	that's just my home directory
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0181729_0181889	if you haven't got it it's on the couch it is
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0274286_0274539	because something you're gonna get a lot of results for
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0021965_0022709	and you can re call it you can write the uh rights the objects and then you call the objects back and they ha those retained objects have all the information that they need
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0134278_0134441	yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0143784_0144054	um well it would would have been like a list of
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0140160_0140436	well thing is if it's being done there are there is
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0188405_0188759	search for stuff for start working i don't know
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0105765_0105892	yeah that kind of makes sense
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0230548_0230731	yeah just yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0203630_0203968	so we can yeah sort of um you know guide them
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0149086_0149296	the punch that
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0248492_0248785	forty minutes
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0042237_0042339	the one present okay
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0061822_0062225	the speaker class knows about all of that stuff and the meeting class knows about that stuff
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0254517_0254873	oh right um i write this meeting up and i'll send it to pinnelius as well
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0213571_0214400	so the f only thing that comes up when you finish is a um when you start it's just one window like that and it's got all the search stuff right down there
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0171739_0172055	periodic each word in the um in the index
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0103596_0104380	um with all the and that because it's it's the dialogue class that you use there
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0273228_0273333	can discuss on friday
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0205682_0205884	now no that's not what i'm suggesting
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0162322_0162464	it's true
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0072563_0073206	what are you wanting to write that directly or what what do you wanna do with that
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0248688_0248940	or th three black
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0161826_0162209	yeah uh i wasn't sure if it was or not
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0151721_0151946	because if you just have the segmentation that's great
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0203968_0204271	and this is like hey my task is to do this and there's a button for it
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0199722_0200105	yeah it's not enough information is it
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0034640_0034795	yeah exactly
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0251707_0251921	if one's bad for you then we won't okay
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0002066_0002306	oops
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0104515_0104905	oh i just can ask if we should assume that they will wanna lose a meeting first but not necessarily
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0160264_0160488	the yeah but that won't slow it down
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0195904_0196265	like if they're part of export group they wanna get into there
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0175914_0176170	or we choose the list of meetings that we wanted to search to do that
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0242860_0243033	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0054355_0054561	it just tell it tells you who participated
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0241212_0241619	right so anyone else have anything to say
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0199005_0199280	yeah okay right
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0264093_0264561	if if if they're looking for like i say sixty day and
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0138712_0139019	um do you actually need the uh the frequencies
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0200585_0200849	i forgot
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0169308_0169412	that's a compartment now
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0050993_0051116	you have to remove the object
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0165350_0165897	but um the thing is we're just looking for when it happens in a meeting if they're looking for particular timer or something
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0207407_0207598	yeah as well
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0144032_0144273	it's the amount that they acquire over certain documents
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0235971_0236358	you've got a lot of num something and then night something and then end something
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0138687_0138799	well can i
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0173224_0174008	let's guess you just do a sum of the um of the the individual t. v. d. for each term retained
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0090305_0090583	but it can't do them it can't do them if it thinks they're one
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0184287_0185068	so to come back to the start screen i'm i'm i'm i'm very sorry about what that should look like
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0175414_0175908	if it's all it's gonna do is look for se specific uh 'cause then it's gonna go into the the energy t. set and return that isn't it
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0134088_0134278	yeah the long names
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0103440_0103544	yeah right
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0193944_0194339	because we we just wanna have a way of of yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0147775_0147937	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0260094_0260376	um it's just pressing
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0075245_0075906	but i will yeah i was going to update that one just 'cause yeah it just makes sense that then you then you can test it yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0161107_0161604	it still uses an evaluate but it ranks the results by the amount by the higher yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0016779_0017338	well okay um when we talk about speaker characterization how are we accessing the list of speakers
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0217577_0217753	well we don't actually have user names do we
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0239098_0239480	so you ended up just it say returns a end text box
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0136433_0136556	okay let's go assess it
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0126076_0126392	tested tried some else and shut down loaded it up
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0238529_0238836	just like this is this is uh un identifiable
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0230731_0230930	that's like nice in easy
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0205757_0205864	that wasn't alright
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0106524_0106641	oh
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0271599_0271853	well yeah yeah you all yes

AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0238062_0238529	and most of the descriptions are hints to each other saying you've got to update this journal
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0209594_0209856	yeah yeah or one uh f yeah or one uh
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0183640_0183894	okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay that
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0251001_0251148	well y yeah well yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0112036_0112390	well now then they would open the meeting first right
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0221165_0221415	or any you can go for go or go for the other
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0281256_0281671	so that sh that shouldn't be there really
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0287732_0287850	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0054132_0054324	well
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0175908_0176137	so i yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0207616_0207937	but i mean the main thing what you wanna do is to view a meeting right
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0065949_0066289	if i gave you one if i gave you it now and you worked on it
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0248492_0248671	li oh
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0254165_0254342	but i don't think that will be not so
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0182591_0182876	but yeah what is yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0166691_0167133	you know you c if you have uh if if you search for language and you return like you know
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0229367_0229594	it's not the same it's doing a quick exit
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0010398_0010516	so how are we getting in a long
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0246596_0246706	possibly i don't know
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0031695_0032375	so it can indeed come back as a ha you can have the hash table or you can have it returned as a vendor and it will say noise
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0264931_0265179	um or if if they are to i don't
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0082847_0083407	they've got like user highlights um selection highlights time heights and
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0146188_0146938	so if you so the more it says in specific documents compared compared to its general score the better more informative it is about a certain
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0179386_0179709	that's uh yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0130271_0130817	yeah make it stripes as for as long as possible and then only your turn things when they actually is but then it needs to has to resets
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0199684_0200295	um it's not like they come back every day and do the same thing
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0199338_0199448	you can have a favourites
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0101760_0101866	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0270631_0270975	or you could have you could personalise it you could just put a weight against it
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0229882_0230290	then it just be nice to have some basic information on on each of the meetings
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0180329_0180467	actually it should work yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0181393_0181581	basic information retrieval
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0191972_0192304	price by meeting browse by law based on speaker
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0230659_0230821	and then that doesn't get in the in the way
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0246706_0246996	usually by then it's a dead break
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0207456_0207592	yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0169607_0169964	now just like edinburgh and language oh no
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0272028_0272402	yeah just just just dismissed it yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0075146_0075269	okay yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0116826_0117456	so i'm just thinking if it's kinda like you're saying you have to have a norm object right
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0180351_0180980	uh uh if you were this this there's a low low load about it in in marketing and shots
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0033810_0034240	what the what the easiest thing to dis how how you wanna display it
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0147825_0148187	yeah so it general one is yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0158525_0158712	oh do we need to
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0186781_0187146	but then that's probably pretty much the same for the same group
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0274023_0274217	it doesn't have to be all intelligent
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0027954_0028342	um actually even the surfaces or whatever you just any sort of thing
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0216096_0216266	yeah that looks about right
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0065605_0065949	it would become out of sync and get a bit funny
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0161402_0161533	that would just be nice extra
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0278617_0278907	if they do then there's a possibility that they c acquire together
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0187627_0187906	do you want that on the top up screen yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0077597_0078132	so there is um and then you can play
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0147937_0148548	but plus a stop list so you remove stuff that doesn't that it like and then there which is gonna have a d a p basically equal score
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0025733_0026149	but that's what i wanted to how how what format do you want the data to come back in
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0215704_0216048	and the other the top it says welcome to welcome to our browser
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0250419_0250544	how about what
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0111239_0111597	because we don't wanna attach um locally we wanna attach globally
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0030913_0031695	so then it's got inside it's got a link p it's got a it's got the speak is name and then it's got their percentage for that thing
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0052355_0052804	then you pro call loaded and you can call load on whatever one or all of them or anything like that
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0198689_0198979	if you only want us to look at like five minutes
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0057730_0058078	because at the moment if you right click on the topic window on one of the topics
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0087170_0087588	you were loading like a new corpus each time for each meeting but you're doing the object
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0280998_0281269	so i don't i don't know i don't know what what it's doing
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0181928_0182058	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0172508_0173238	and if it was then we go close and do the the energy source uh to look for the exact curve or the regular expression or whatever
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0041734_0041973	is it popularated by the one present or the one highlighted
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0259469_0259873	um there's just sort of the basic implementation stuff that i was wondering about
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0193761_0193944	um i don't think we need that yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0190217_0190360	yeah or you kn yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0017338_0017486	that i want to talk about that actually
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0071909_0072240	just uh load this one instead of the the default
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0092783_0092912	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0204383_0204496	you know
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0078938_0079543	yeah and just um to wire in the the topics and uh
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0205719_0206009	just a it's a circuit button it's just a g
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0118825_0119318	um so for getting any usable data it's it's gonna be doing a search on each of those files
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0061553_0062005	oh alright so oh so that that is all sta stored together
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0176617_0176931	like just wondering if if it's gonna give us something cool then yeah absolutely
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0078818_0078938	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0076114_0076300	alright yeah and then update
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0270757_0270985	well um but you still have to do the circuit
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0209471_0209691	yeah that's easy sort of thing and
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0026808_0026979	actually i don't that might also help
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0153001_0153109	see you the keys that
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0056609_0057022	or just return another all or a blank or a blank string or something yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0235811_0235971	oh yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0090583_0091142	because then it's just about the amount that each t if you you have to kinda call a new class and then it would do it fine
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0058924_0059029	yeah yeah that would be a problem
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0236358_0236513	and the and exit t. something
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0271683_0271921	so if you how many papers you get you can
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0227691_0227942	and just you just say i wanna look for this user
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0135999_0136107	so if it's accurate
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0172055_0172193	well that's way we think about it
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0274305_0274557	well that's sort of what is s yeah that's true
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0011623_0012020	like if you're in the topic and it goes an highlights the topic in the text or whatever
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0134666_0134793	okay well that's what then
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0167571_0168186	but if it's like a two word term does the t. v. i. d. handle that
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0277014_0277640	the um if sony and d. aren't mentioned together a lot but twenty ninety five percent of the ones
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0062708_0063054	so have you done these yet the yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0026783_0026961	we have to be easy to display on the screen
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0044062_0044474	so that c that would call that we call that and call the meetings method that said return then
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0063800_0063948	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0264561_0264931	yeah sunni shows up in this document today shows up but they're not together
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0047031_0047163	so do you want to do that then
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0256327_0256480	oh that's somebody was connected to them
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0227076_0227367	yeah that's true that's a noise
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0274873_0275008	something like that would just push it up
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0216811_0217577	because we need to drop down menu but we want all the information about the name the long name and the s and the users
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0149964_0150187	the the term frequency in vs document frequency
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0078579_0078992	so is that what you're working on now then to to rip to present results nice or
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0083866_0084550	so you can quite easily if your text area is called aria you just do arrow dot set highlights or something you know
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0281996_0282399	so if it w so yeah if you review twenty five why why do you stop
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0148964_0149212	push the keys
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0030576_0030860	one is to send news and one is to present participation
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0107714_0107884	and if it hasn't loaded then for example to load in
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0069420_0069766	but i d only i'll need to have done all this stuff too first
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0026149_0026783	because it can come back as almost anything
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0158712_0159014	and i mean we're just looking oh for for your for your stuff i guess yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0074876_0075176	um i have a copy yes
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0250371_0250565	um could go for a bit
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0288070_0288203	have timed off already
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0197378_0197509	well how how are we gonna know that
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0147303_0147608	the volume you cope with the corporate tita yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0131880_0132180	so yeah or they could check mark against the ones they want a check
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0009179_0009353	that you just said the same thing is you just said to us
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0160737_0161085	nei but the general inverted file
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0027329_0027798	uh mean so the things are all modular i mean it would be good idea if we use that same idea for anything else we do
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0277942_0278075	if you just e edit them together
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0051305_0051769	so what you do is you call a normal contractor 'cause th if you call the proper contractor for each meeting
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0193671_0193905	or we could keep it a more general
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0233878_0233998	now
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0076744_0076902	so yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0210117_0210615	basically either the user w knows which meeting you want to look at you just click on it
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0253648_0254165	then if three is a problem five six will be a problem 'cause i won't be here
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0281344_0281597	well yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0071484_0071909	actually i can upload my stuff as well i just have to make one change to your file
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0050140_0050561	the only like a one um without a one 'kay
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0035962_0036317	so that's the ki how did we china have a look at that again
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0280821_0280998	um well right now it's not doing anything
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0242621_0243025	like friday afternoon or something
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0200457_0200585	exactly
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0204271_0204383	oh perfect
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0149632_0149922	exa what's the eye in t. v. and t. v.
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0204433_0204785	now that's um
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0162242_0162710	now we did yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0255359_0256031	because this is not here
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0182876_0183163	do the p. d. f. switch it to push curves which back to p. d. f. then
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0186624_0186781	do you use that topic
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0153454_0154048	instead of it would just search for key words and when it when it when you t you tell 'em they're topic suggestions for the topics you're actually cut cutting the keywords
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0223687_0224067	oh
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0058078_0058747	you have the option of pop popping open a window which gives you a list of all the meetings containing that topic
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0039137_0039381	yeah but also the design thingy
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0124992_0125139	it's not too slow though i don't think
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0130817_0130921	one it needs to be loaded
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0195627_0195904	what are the range of things that they'd want to do
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0061042_0061259	you know to s yeah for the globe
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0032977_0033810	well you can either have uh you can either have a you can have a like an embedded uh b infrared or a ray of springs and each one represents one person or whatever
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0180210_0180351	uh i guess it that's a lot in the literature
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0274539_0274873	and if the one that you got just happened to be at the bottom and it was actually the most relevant one
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0121255_0121388	because otherwise we'll crush the thing
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0158716_0158970	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0223959_0224134	twelve tip
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0002541_0002756	you
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0018397_0019186	if some if you wanna do that then then tell me how you want the data presented how the 'cause
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0104905_0105239	again if they're doing a search on the entire yeah corpus
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0102381_0102717	lobe me a meeting a little earlier let me something else
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0158970_0159494	now no no but that's what isn't that what the idea was in the first place is to rank the s rank the results so that
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0024593_0025389	um which means that you just re call the and our new constructor and call the load thing and call it that way you can create a list of them or a vector of them or whatever we wanna do
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0093795_0093898	so
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0212516_0213348	or or the search but the search window could have on it something that said just has a drop down menu that says just an go button that said take me to this
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0261426_0262136	well i c i kinda think it would complicate things quite a bit and not bring us a lot
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0081159_0081352	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0100590_0100987	um but no or something that just sort of guides them to the most obvious things
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0257021_0257501	so can we just can we just repeat briefly what we've spoken about
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0114127_0114868	then at that point they'll probably wanna like do we want to like if it dop by the default goes with the first one and they want number five of the ones that are retained
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0210971_0211077	fits is criteria
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0028672_0028802	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0267660_0268069	you know my language is german or something stupid that you don't really want
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0200922_0201065	um okay
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0169412_0169892	uh sorry
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0004764_0005099	do you wanna take a look at comments
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0189594_0190013	like if they if they know exactly where they wanna go they wanna go to you know that meeting on the separate third
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0253216_0253648	that's true uh 'cause i say three loop and then um if there's a problem with that
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0018522_0018869	yeah i i was thinking about uh i was going in that direction anyway
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0170303_0170774	in it's most simple form it would do separate for each one each term
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0262837_0263091	like if someone's looking for a particular term
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0066787_0067293	and you'd have to and then you'd have a multiple copies of objects over the place and it get silly i think
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0107270_0107714	it could probably even that should shouldn't be too hard to put uh project in there
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0021812_0021965	and they're they're two different objects
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0063948_0064594	so it's all all usable now can i do it tonight
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0255144_0255359	now
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0179940_0180210	how you combine that is this up to you
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0251571_0252344	um well no no that that would only give us like thirty five minutes or something
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0005698_0005937	it's gonna uh was given by a man
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0238373_0238569	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0099959_0100154	it doesn't take too long though
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0143830_0144030	what what does t. v. f. ten for
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0050671_0050993	and then it's just each more the objects got a return bunch of revenue
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0068569_0068860	it that doesn't matter but uh okay
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0111483_0111596	yeah yeah it could be yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0221477_0221637	it th it could be a pity to lose the
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0141729_0142205	um but it had sort of all that standard sort of stuff but it uh at last i heard it wasn't working
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0132245_0132471	did we think about um
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0282773_0282891	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0108922_0109064	but you won't
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0121424_0121743	um yeah well i'm just thinking of some way we could you know
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0010769_0011623	um one thing that i was wondering is there's standard control that you use to connect the different things
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0017486_0018262	um the speak i'm the deputy processing is fine but i would don't particularly want to do the p the the the the goofy for it
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0111938_0112083	well yeah it's alright
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0109743_0110080	but you have to have it has to start with something for some design reason
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0052649_0052811	oh
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0271367_0271506	yeah yeah i know
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0128257_0128525	first as a first step only retain the meetings
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0185068_0185739	mean we wanna uh for the part where you can choose choose the the meeting what kind of information do you want to have about the meeting
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0265179_0265811	it just doesn't you're looking for that term and relevance is kind of irrelevant because if the term shows up it shows up
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0105197_0105814	and i mean i think they should have two options either load up a meeting that they choose or do a search
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0244908_0245011	hey for the next week yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0234538_0234956	think it's a nice object model i don't know
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0050422_0050663	so let's all just press process and just okay
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0236930_0237076	oh
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0199280_0199424	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0176137_0176267	yeah yeah that's true
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0178851_0179386	yeah i don't know how that works
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0162464_0162631	so uh it's only in the middle
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0281142_0281256	well it's not that many meetings
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0168924_0169280	just something like uh edinburgh university
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0277640_0277942	the it's time will be low and it'll push down the other one if you combine them
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0099910_0100194	some animation dancing on it
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0165897_0166317	they just want to have that team exist there and where does it exist now wanna see it yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0196786_0197287	well if they're part of a b. d. b. working group they're gonna wanna look at the p. d. b. ones and so develop to that
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0281067_0281627	yeah there are only sixty f but there are seventy five meetings
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0244241_0244628	so do we wanna erase this get this one earlier maybe
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0063054_0063276	the just gotta decide on what we wanna
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0176403_0176608	but um
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0256480_0256648	but uh well that's what i thought when you said that
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0042347_0042747	although we could did we could do the one highlighted i suppose
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0209467_0209594	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0085892_0086548	um so you just have a few more things to do with that and then uh once panel gets the uh the index
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0091133_0091466	oh the electric it's more dead not more remote
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0247460_0247646	yeah for that
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0269500_0269766	well it could yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0106173_0106536	it it w needs you to have a mailing listed before you start doing any searching at all that's not
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0233998_0234346	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0060366_0060622	so how how do you p how would you calculate that
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0024199_0024593	um and we'll store those objects so that object files
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0034863_0035710	um so what we'll whenever we open a window for one speaker um
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0039278_0039458	okay
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0076902_0077102	um you all just make that one and let you know
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0139748_0140090	and i mean do you think you would have have time for that as well
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0129236_0129671	then it gives you as a result all the meetings that contain the word language
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0117710_0117866	yeah but local such
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0064279_0064838	um no design in the g. c. first and because it it w the problem is if you change the colours
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0140755_0141096	there's a class you're trying to get uh to work on friday
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0046199_0046352	meetings
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0089041_0089444	that way it doesn't crash if you try to load all ten in one it crashes doesn't it
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0119572_0120392	but yeah the the global um infrared allows gives n the norm objects basically to the local set right
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0117456_0117835	mean before you do a survey at all on this
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0266434_0267224	you know some some meetings which have as a topic language they specifically speak about language and they use that word like in every sentence
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0208257_0208441	so th even if it just had two things
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0212121_0212516	and then that brings up the browser after you've f searched for something
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0214400_0214615	so this is your search
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0053540_0053686	oh each meeting okay
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0093287_0093764	alright well i've been uh i've been doing some random pop ups for the speaker activation which is good
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0219180_0219359	okay
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0019778_0020295	one that represents the meetings and the meet and the information about both is combined within each object
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0121092_0121255	but he gives one at a time anyway doesn't it
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0039381_0039876	what are these people going for
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0197755_0197983	could be the user manual
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0272761_0273228	you'll have the results as before but yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0065272_0065398	and then i haven't quite finished it
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0006711_0006820	okay okay let's see
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0080874_0081304	so it goes in and hides 'cause that's i don't know
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0240638_0240914	yeah try your crazy
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0048565_0048700	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0224950_0225317	the very yeah very clean on that yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0233769_0233929	uh i i think
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0279167_0279738	but you have no ranking system at the moment so if something's abo highly ranked thing from t. v. r. d
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0163798_0164155	because i mean then then it would give you like if you search for words
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0194339_0195069	because as soon as they've got loaded their first meeting you they can they can browse through that quite nicely
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0190360_0191168	and i wanna look at the meeting where so on so spoke um of that you know s some sort of research group
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0216813_0216963	the dop drop down menu
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0046899_0047044	yeah yeah that would be easy as well yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0278040_0278313	well the things i mean that will be exactly how we're doing it now
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0243115_0243612	mean uh i think i think i'm gonna do quite a bit of work this week so i'll have probably more to talk about
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0068232_0068607	you mean just the yeah but it's not gonna take very long
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0203619_0203867	oh right oh okay
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0061027_0061353	what the global statistics comes straight after that don't they
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0063289_0063528	what we want yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0256003_0256253	it's cool for the gifted it
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0038476_0038941	the the influence is uh i lifted in germany for six months don't know if that had any effect
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0230807_0230954	yeah maybe that's the best idea then
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0187258_0187797	probab for the most part i mean there'll be a set of people that do and then a sub set for each meeting probably
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0123539_0123775	now we're gonna have to have all that other data in there
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0240763_0241021	yeah i know it's definitely
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0020295_0020877	so and then they ri write texts objects and the objects contain all the information about the meetings and the speakers
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0057141_0057373	there are some there are some audio ones that actually
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0217344_0217656	oh you want have i yeah the easy to use
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0250517_0250815	so we say three clock and then if there's a specific problem
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0123043_0123539	if uh if it's trying to show us where those were if it's trying to highlight those in the text transferer whatever
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0181530_0181646	okay okay
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0235175_0235508	nei yeah is your right it's the right curve for s yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0115184_0115431	well not like to load up like the thing is i think
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0185739_0186339	and the uh the the longer name obviously if there is one 'cause they don't all have a long name
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0244907_0245123	well we can disc discuss on friday if we have one
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0171385_0171739	because the thing is the thing is that the way we were doing it we were just looking for the words
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0159909_0160355	because the n. c. d.'s over the whole of the covers it's just not feasible
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0234696_0234930	nei oh yes this is
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0260376_0260692	um we did we decide whether it should be ranked
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0091884_0092582	oh it costs me yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0084903_0085417	that's the way i did it to to highlight to cross highlight between topic and and transcripts
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0249187_0249353	the reason
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0174408_0174774	and the higher the more uh more informative each term is for each thing we'd give you a
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0136130_0136376	so i've yeah i put that in already too
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0064838_0065272	it the objects serial numbers change and you can't delete the object so all the processing has to be done over again
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0120772_0120979	we yeah that that's always gonna be the case with such
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0158504_0158755	yeah that's why i'm thinking too yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0234025_0234141	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0059029_0059346	and then you could do a search over the meetings over the objects
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0166295_0166492	but it's it's how how informative
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0163365_0163504	oh yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0070898_0071135	on your home directory not in the okay
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0237498_0237773	the apex is all right but there's not a lot of discussion in it
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0147621_0147931	well you know you can you might have some general frequencies
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0188759_0189152	or or browse okay like search browse um
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0228112_0228471	finally then it puts up a list of all the ones who got that user in
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0016228_0016669	like other topics or well we're gonna do it for speaker i guess and all the rest right
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0263091_0263526	um i don't know it's just i just don't know if it would bring us that much
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0073552_0074028	you c yeah but are you do you wanna change that m the original and border file then
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0139344_0139509	to do the top it's liable
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0283566_0283669	well at the time when
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0027798_0027954	oh what else are we doing
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0272131_0272336	yeah so then just push next
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0056071_0056435	but that would be that would cost us a problem with anything that wasn't adequate for topics
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0034053_0034342	um yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0275434_0275852	um and then we could actually put that like on the list of um meetings that get repeated
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0169675_0169803	our sixty day
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0273225_0273883	because if we are using that i mean it does make sense for that but uh yeah and there's actually yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0198418_0198689	but that would defy the whole point of browsing right
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0005327_0005656	did we get seventeen out of time for the email
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0135077_0135305	oh that's what that's the working group is
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0048166_0048640	so yeah random things like just like retained talking time or
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0126975_0127464	but uh if it doesn't take that long each time then that should be alright
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0014626_0014856	so you should probably look at the
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0066289_0066787	and then i changed it and ran the thing again and you would never be able to get the objects back up
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0101016_0101819	so do we want yeah maybe we could write in on like the whatever it's called the the top of the window saying welcome to the meeting browser
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0106555_0106792	well we can put the logic in there yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0260692_0260798	now
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0156222_0157189	the easy bit is it's probably easier to calculate them based upon in their whole occurrences in the cups than it is to calculate them per topic
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0071077_0071212	now i'm put away
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0125328_0125523	but i don't think that will be a too much of a problem
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0209821_0210117	yeah that oh all happens for the search basically
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0053919_0054132	or do we have to be useful for some of the other stuff we're doing
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0248940_0249187	or no or you wanna get out
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0050910_0051055	okay
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0091142_0091801	but if you don't then it won't yeah it says okay oh yeah you've got all this space you can use up
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0106846_0106986	oh ju just beep mm
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0224556_0224692	at total yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0251379_0251707	would you wanna no probably not
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0055903_0056071	yeah if that wouldn't be too difficult
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0168416_0168525	would like what
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0252344_0252592	well what i won't quite late
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0229192_0229367	if they do in speak are they in search
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0078233_0078625	we have to get better results like better presented
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0110675_0110886	uh the engineering class only has one second of it
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0071212_0071434	well it's finished up put it global one otherwise it'll get confusing
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0222777_0223344	and then it gives you the longer name blah and then it gives you the you know the participants
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0077311_0077597	because yeah like i say two lines of code if that
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0090063_0090305	you can do that uh file
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0153109_0153454	but you could do keywords search could be topic search could it be the same thing
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0171103_0171347	and then and then uh add those up or something
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0032689_0032977	it will say executive that's co i don't know why every
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0135734_0135923	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0208271_0208431	so and both of those we have them
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0139058_0139344	yeah the two um what it says talking about the two
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0208096_0208257	let's such yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0146883_0147426	so the general score would that be a um for the whole of the language or for all uh for all the whole of the copies
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0243877_0244106	then we won't have to have the meeting with steve on today
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0258117_0258709	we've mentioned topic labelling with uh keywords
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0138521_0138764	the document finances for each word in the costs
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0177584_0178053	yeah without doing any like um wood pads which is just a mission
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0184522_0184819	oh i thought it would sort of this
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0021528_0021812	so that's two separate costs just for me
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0134441_0134649	like the the working group that it's part of
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0074114_0074311	well your version yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0023891_0024199	yes basically the all calculated yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0172133_0172283	yeah you don't wanna stop looking for buy
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0182581_0182878	understand the feedback
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0044963_0045399	uh mean that would um that would be um implementing what he said
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0270985_0271210	you still have to do the energy circuit then right
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0211248_0211482	just it opens and the search window opens
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0014333_0014626	um it has some sort of highlighting stuff there
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0223369_0224053	we could do microphone static and hold it over and it pops up a thing
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0218657_0218789	we don't want them to type them do we
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0268069_0268282	so you wanna distinguish those somehow
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0070452_0070695	is that stored in the uh
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0161604_0161818	oh i thought that was part of it but yeah 'kay that doesn't matter if it's not
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0259136_0259489	and mike did you have anything else
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0082443_0082847	you've got just look at the the what they wrote about it
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0093949_0094239	the windows are all there now after lots of filling
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0271207_0271446	yeah you do the n. l. c. sets and it doesn't show up together that
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0217753_0218050	aren't all the codes like ami eleven or whatever
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0283224_0283732	oh look through the wall
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0180467_0180583	okay then it's yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0282559_0283107	or it turns to twenty even if it turns to twenty do you call it up at ten do you wake 'em do you what was the threshold
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0123775_0124048	so each time when we have the shurch window and we have like you know
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0060622_0061042	would you do the summarization as you populate it
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0221530_0222119	now no no i'm not i'm not saying you can you can pick a user but it should come up with some less
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0254414_0254517	oh
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0107942_0108922	what we but doesn't that we c you could use the innovative file search to turn a list of f of meetings and then use one of those to load in search
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0023131_0023532	or everything but that's why i wanted to know how h what's the easiest way to have the data
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0038899_0039180	oh
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0049713_0050140	it presents is a whole lot off line it stores it as a object and then they have much smoother
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0078132_0078233	there's not much to do yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0252439_0252628	it's mine on but we the other than we need it
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0136797_0137361	so yeah again concretely to the start up star up um whatever is window
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0198979_0199684	well you just uh you just scroll down the less and find your favourite one
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0234025_0234264	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0059346_0059579	because that's the thing these these are so small
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0099112_0099725	or just or is it more like alright alright alright
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0044474_0044823	and that would populate that which would be anything to do
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0021698_0021836	okay yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0118293_0118486	you can light the dome one up with doesn't have any
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0116003_0116206	right now i think just the top ones
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0125539_0126076	it always seems to be slow loading up the first time at least like that's all i've been doing lately is just sorta loading it up
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0036622_0037082	it's if it's in that format it's speaker
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0117866_0118149	we can't loseable circuit without anything
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0048700_0048948	get total time i think it's cool and i mean it's something like that yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0238946_0239111	oh
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0124688_0124836	next one
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0217831_0217942	the which is not essential
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0272813_0273225	well f we'll have to talk to panel about this then just 'cause uh see how she's uh doing this
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0118131_0118293	it doesn't take long to load up anyway
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0140651_0140755	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0201065_0201541	well now i'm just getting back to sort of what could be on the the start up screen
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0073336_0073698	well yeah just the one thing that's like the action for loading up the search thing
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0227367_0227691	but that's why you could just have a list of your users then
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0189349_0189594	like if you're looking for something spec like is that what you're thinking
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0188748_0188875	uh yeah yeah i guess that's useful
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0042122_0042347	um the one present
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0218967_0219105	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0192679_0193086	like if they're looking for particular person particular working group particular whatever
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0039876_0040167	so then that all that's calculated as well
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0112390_0113079	so let's say they have two options either pick one meeting or search globally to find a meeting that they like
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0271446_0271683	either disregard it or put a weighting against it
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0181581_0181729	they've got a big a good chart on it
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0235208_0235417	readable corpus or something
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0284081_0284542	but you wanna find the one that actually contains it usually somehow
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0026456_0026737	uh what is this gonna become back here
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0166492_0166721	that t. f. t. is an information score isn't it
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0163504_0163648	yeah b needs to have
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0275852_0276514	if there are fifteen meetings with languages in then it's gonna show you those and rank 'em as to which is the highest
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0012020_0012646	is there a particular type of control that like is there are one of these andrex t. or sorry um night controls
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0164659_0164887	now it'll be so useful
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0073206_0073320	if you wanna change my code
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0121743_0122317	just cash the results and you know nice little format that'll make things a bit easier
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0086548_0086820	um then that's gonna be kinda fun
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0041434_0041734	so then does this how does is how is this box populated
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0036517_0036622	okay
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0150779_0150892	alright
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0176267_0176403	so the yeah that's less crude in the
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0253117_0253282	well three o'clock let's say three o'clock for now
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0211482_0211798	and that's the interface then you just go from there
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0260798_0260979	for now
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0250894_0251001	we could try to roughly after
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0162977_0163392	but yeah i guess uh if you d if if that's not part of it i don't worry about it doesn't
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0278907_0279111	and then we do the n. e. c. circuit on that document
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0271210_0271367	if if it doesn't show up
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0097625_0098398	and i have a question about the w said we wanted us to star screen
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0022987_0023159	okay yeah i see what you mean
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0282576_0282773	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0275247_0275434	yeah okay so you mean
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0240635_0240763	uh
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0111597_0111799	so so let's say
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0147426_0147543	okay
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0208990_0209204	and then another one that said search that loud just instant
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0200295_0200898	let's see what's changed today
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0009745_0009928	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0076547_0076744	yeah i haven't i haven't made any changes to it yet
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0201541_0201912	like there's just a range of things we could do we could have like search options browse options
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0048868_0048973	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0167959_0168230	panel it three a component sounds
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0062858_0063016	nei nei about the new product of course
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0171523_0171710	you can you can just add 'em up or you can
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0006355_0006523	excellent
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0092912_0093190	spend too much time in front of it i think
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0210615_0211023	or he doesn't and then he searches for one that sort of looks like
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0255501_0255898	oh i mean that you're collecting oh right oh yes alright
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0232844_0233013	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0037768_0038191	so all of this is uh all that's calculated as well it's all the speaker objects
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0038941_0039137	just spend too much time talking to bricks
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0092196_0092783	does it talk to you now does it
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0040167_0040336	all we have to do is get the dialogue acts
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0022709_0023131	and then you can call method to return whatever you want
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0149507_0149838	the keys three f three five volts
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0096059_0096200	okay
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0285850_0286022	well we'll discuss it again on friday
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0186339_0186624	what the users that spoke
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0283425_0283566	is there still more we uh
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0225963_0226273	yeah you have yeah yes
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0234815_0235146	just but it's i think in that case it's the right corpus
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0054561_0055144	at the moment it tells you who participated in the amount they participated in presentations and in time as well
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0283612_0284081	it would be useful as well for a word like language that might occur in all of them
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0142825_0143125	but if we need the if we do need the frequencies then
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0263885_0264236	uh think i think it would it would it would give you the most relevant result
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0246398_0246596	um
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0163648_0163764	oh
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0131406_0131880	because i'm sure they don't wanna have the extra loading time either if they can avoid it
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0062567_0062708	it sounds good
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0268426_0268832	yeah that would help a lot for that s for single terms it would be very useful
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0120470_0120896	but it it could be time consuming like if there are ten documents that hit with this uh
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0230290_0230807	yeah i'm thinking that that up dates depending on what you've got highlighted
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0230146_0230659	well you can have a text box there that's gonna yeah as you go over them
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0197880_0198070	uh you can have a size preferences
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0211013_0211248	well the other thing to do is just have search as the default
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0051769_0052052	it goes off and does all the processing in stores its own object
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0159488_0159909	uh sort of but then the main idea was more like to to speed it up to speak the setup up
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0249767_0249998	because i think she's got a class at eleven
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0238542_0238862	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0204529_0204737	oh no
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0110808_0111239	as i suppose we wouldn't wanna use yeah we yeah we wouldn't wanna use an extra t. at the beginning anyway
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0141096_0141729	um they did have all that now it's sort of built in and just uh had some trouble getting it running properly
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0181880_0182342	yeah i've got uh somewhere p. d. f.
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0154224_0154366	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0222119_0222777	but an extended list of the of the meetings so you know you have b. d. r. whatever it was called uh one
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0132988_0133108	well i think they were in the text
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0232000_0232366	some sort of fields which updates dynamically depending on what you've got highlighted
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0169892_0170033	and not an adaptive yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0226273_0226386	let's do that a lot but then
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0106774_0107296	you can't the the only thing you can survey is a night object model and the only time you get one of those if you've loaded an observation
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0075818_0076625	because i usually i usually work on my own copy for for the day and then update it without checking if if the one in the shared one has changed
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0215917_0216096	uh-huh
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0209137_0209471	yeah like find specific meeting
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0068265_0068459	it's that yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0248060_0248216	oh okay
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0053397_0053633	one object for each meeting
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0115580_0116003	um like it loads up it load up the transcript window and uh whatever other window
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0220271_0220456	but then yeah as i said how do you do
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0236408_0237040	uh think the end ones are interfaces and the night one one of the ways around one's interface and ones actually in implemented class
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0105794_0105945	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0242760_0242869	it might be useful once it
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0152722_0153001	also key words give you an o a whole new type of sets
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0149296_0149507	just a list of like three words or something
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0052052_0052355	and then um if you call a new controller
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0055391_0055574	yeah yeah that'll be pretty easy yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0134767_0134902	it probably even it could yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0148571_0149086	so what would the if we had the these fake topics what d what would they look like
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0206558_0207407	just 'cause they don't want people to go to all the menus and search themselves and just like do commonly use tasks or just exit and just let me use the programme
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0235508_0235796	it's the night right corporate and then you got nice right elements in it
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0271853_0272207	well it wouldn't show up on the search results if it if it didn't exist together
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0274879_0275247	well the thing is also i mean if it's well yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0048030_0048200	okay yeah that's fine then
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0179192_0179324	so or or print it
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0284934_0285207	you know you still wanna be able to search for for the word language
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0064551_0064694	but
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0135328_0135540	yeah i love that
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0105945_0106173	but the stupid electronic t. c. t. s
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0134502_0135159	even one of them is yeah one of them's even even better understanding or something
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0015536_0015731	uh i'm not sure if it's embedded there to be honest
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0272981_0273098	yeah i have till the end of the meeting
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0046420_0047031	and um and it would come up with how much they spoke and you can pick the one that looks most interesting
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0149212_0149416	that that'd be the easiest thing
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0032375_0032689	it's just this streams noise w export
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0087588_0088289	so you don't need to just uh 'cause if we uh if we do have like if the inverted circuit says that there's you know
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0144273_0145030	basically the amount the t the d. f. ten is the document for example that each word covers um no what is it
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0177957_0178333	or also like to do um wild cards work for something like that
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0164813_0165282	it would that was the whole point was to this is your top one this is your bottom
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0243694_0243809	yeah i should have more to talk about
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0110080_0110675	the engine there's only one there's only one search method to the search engine
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0230954_0231487	so you've got a drop down menu a circuit circuit button not circuit go button
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0244628_0244888	three uh sorry i don't know
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0163367_0163566	yeah i mean if you have time
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0081352_0082292	as for um um for an end target area whatever it is um they they define some ha handy highlights on that
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0269321_0269500	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0180980_0181393	so they've got a whole chunk about uh so just i. r. is this
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0276282_0276454	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0179683_0179870	yeah 'cause
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0045889_0046420	so you could you could zap through these topics uh meeting sorry
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0168186_0168529	it's not a component now it's just two words together
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0099725_0099959	oh right yeah exactly
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0051116_0051305	it's got a load method
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0171222_0171385	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0190013_0190401	and they just wanna go there and see stuff then they can immediately go and browse that
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0287733_0287945	bottom
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0033745_0033849	um
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0225832_0226409	you can't get out of the bunny way i'm trying to access the damn
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0247755_0248019	th i've got a documents appointment at ten to two
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0169446_0169675	well essentially i don't know
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0033862_0034307	um whatever you give me i can do it i think
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0128525_0129236	as in the n not even the meetings but the name of the meetings so you know say you wanna search for the word language
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0158755_0158866	well do we want to
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0126392_0126975	so um so just sort of based on that as well yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0219359_0219525	um and a low manual
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0014128_0014333	in text there it is
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0161982_0162591	oh i don't think we have that in the the document
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0037336_0037437	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0170774_0171163	you could make it more complicated and make it th for the yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0116206_0116826	um although the time is probably more um costed by loading the actual data
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0205884_0206558	now i'm just saying like these are just like a lot of programmes well kind of lame programmes do have that sort of thing first
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0215327_0215467	yeah that's that's what yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0019186_0019778	okay 'cause at the moment the b the the there is i've created two classes one that represents speakers
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0092582_0093326	so nice machine it goes
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0163561_0163750	because i'm only gonna do this if i've got time anyway
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0246996_0247596	um although well i don't know 'cause it's the lab and trying to get some work done for the the lab stuff
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0082292_0082443	so you've got different different highlights
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0034378_0034788	just a matter of deciding what we what would be easiest all the way around i mean
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0047239_0047777	so w i'll just leave in lots of methods that s that would just retain one number at a time
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0028920_0029041	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0220721_0221165	one the one that's one one uh we got two one for meeting ones to speak
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0002306_0002541	does it squeeze in i like that
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0170922_0171222	let's not make it more complicated
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0193086_0193671	and then we just uh we could break things down like that to that level of detail if we want
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0228471_0228698	and then you search then but then you do insert
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0234346_0234496	what does norma sound for
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0263744_0263885	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0204369_0204625	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0233013_0233294	we can do all of that without even ever going anywhere near a loading up uh
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0090860_0091294	okay
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0147533_0147825	so yeah the proba probably it's formancy
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0154203_0154315	for which you still need me
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0219733_0220248	because if you w if you wanna search your search if you wanna look for one meeting just look it then that's fine
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0246177_0246362	just after s. p. two
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0178333_0178889	so if you're looking for wireless wired wire bulb you do wire with a star and um no
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0100154_0100590	it's we have to yeah while we're debugging i'm afraid we're getting sick of it
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0101925_0102381	or a switchboard that comes up that's just a blank form like that with some buttons on
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0038191_0038361	yeah that's that's easy
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0175023_0175228	it's pretty crazy anyway it's just looking for um
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0213348_0213571	so the f so they n yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0224134_0224316	but then yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0166254_0166691	yeah but it would be useful if you yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0157973_0158359	now you can d you can do circuit without t. v. t. v. if you just can't ring the circuit
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0074568_0074831	oh okay so not the actual one but a copy of it
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0191761_0191972	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0183097_0183243	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0102824_0103036	yeah but how
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0239916_0240031	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0224692_0224950	have not tried that yet but i was i was gonna do that
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0076625_0076783	so okay
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0164155_0164659	it would give you the the meetings but also how often the that word appeared in that meeting
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0262136_0262837	just because if it is like independently doing the words for a particular document it's not it's not really getting them together
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0179709_0179940	but the idea is that it gives you an advantage over
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0257501_0258117	so we'd done done uh progress on the speech recognition who does a speak a characterisation
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0155341_0156222	but i suppose even calculating the the p the the what this faces themselves aren't gonna be too much too long
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0283154_0283256	yeah that's true
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0276627_0277014	and um also with thi something like seventy day
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0198070_0198284	it could have a size for example for instance i guess
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0255215_0255501	oh you're just sending it to us
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0214615_0215164	just to here and here is just go to wherever in a go button
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0169280_0169446	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0080297_0080874	just wanna find out what kind of objects those were that um for the others
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0043546_0044062	so it says like get get time and you in it you take a name
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0219563_0219865	okay you're just looking for one specific speaker right
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0269767_0270631	well you could do it and override it by the you c you could just ignore the ranking if it doesn't show up together
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0198689_0199005	oh mm-hmm
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0251148_0251339	well it wouldn't be a long meeting then
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0219105_0219240	drop down it's definitely not
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0049850_0049965	okay i see
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0205023_0205757	ah i was gonna put any you know any any help in there any sort of explanation of how the battery works to be honest
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0237040_0237498	uh 'cause you go back enough and the um the what is it normal again
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0238633_0239098	it's yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0115106_0115222	and i mean just you know
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0072240_0072566	so that's two inches of code
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0129671_0130137	and then you can decide well i wanna search on this in this in this meeting or only on this meeting or
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0111723_0111938	until they know what meeting it is
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0086820_0087170	think i'm just wondering have you had to well uh the way you're do i'm gonna ask if the way you were doing it
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0146533_0146683	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0094447_0094830	well you know just the pop a pop up one day was difficult enough
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0068459_0068569	the tape was
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0178889_0179192	that's actually that's a problem for me too
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0207992_0208211	probably or search something
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0109368_0109743	it has to be an absorption and even if you go on s you can go into the whole corpus from that
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0142205_0142825	so she's gonna look at you know more straight forward sort of thing that really just feels feels what we needed to do
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0256031_0256612	uh i collect meetings somewhere
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0238898_0239158	great i know it
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0196265_0196481	um do we wanna save preferences
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0217863_0218569	yeah but the codes at mean at least maybe if they know the codes and in other top in other uh corpus copy
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0204803_0204956	yeah but we could quite give it a has yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0268462_0268812	in in that sense for single for single word yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0128626_0128741	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0150892_0151721	because that would be really handy then we can actually test it on the user as opposed to just doing it and not using it
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0049571_0049713	neither is it a direct file
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0215164_0215514	and then from there it takes you to wherever else you want to go
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0062005_0062172	oh alright okay
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0242119_0242579	do we yeah do we want another meeting at the end of the week um with paniella
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0079543_0080115	so um yeah that's right well also yeah like that that that is well
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0195177_0195627	um yeah but i'm just thinking like initially when they load up
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0192304_0192679	like d no it's just thing of different ways we can do that like different buttons on the top
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0163566_0163798	do that as well i'd be really nice yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0122317_0123043	but the thing is i mean if we've got that then it's gonna be needing really much really to load the entire corpus for that meeting
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0269326_0269623	ah uh for multiple tours we can just do something really simple
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0168529_0168814	um in i don't know
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0250776_0250894	or if we could try one
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0067308_0067648	well let me know when when it's sort of usable
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0018262_0018397	yeah not not really
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0036935_0037078	just pretty much i thought
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0090239_0090431	really
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0114868_0114978	you mean then you have to go through that
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0093764_0093949	so i can fill that in now
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0143503_0144032	think you need to have that
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0091738_0092049	right okay
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0124307_0124688	go to meeting one then it has to r real remote the phone object
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0075690_0075818	well just just tell me when
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0224883_0225023	house over is it or something
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0067637_0068265	but if you can if you wanna make the picture 'kay you can do that without anything can you just just you
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0237773_0237959	it's it's very green
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0256898_0257262	then we'd know who's missed them or who's if we've done any
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0055128_0055476	can you put in there what topic was spoken about as well
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0100149_0100733	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0015854_0016228	you haven't had to build any new windows to do that sort of thing
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0151946_0152612	but we can't we can't compare it to the to the hand annotated you know the hand segmented tool
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0134649_0134767	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0045399_0045889	that you wanna see per topic you wanna see which one it spoke in most something like that
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0165013_0165350	actually 'cause the thing is i mean typically yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0267224_0267660	and then you've got those that just mention you know mention it briefly like once or twice saying
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0052811_0053116	is this is it for the entire corpus
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0252792_0252904	three is better than five is six
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0016668_0016786	oh what oh no
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0119318_0119664	so it's gonna be loading up each of those one at a time to get the data that we wanna
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0091294_0091408	that's in the
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0240396_0240635	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0204219_0204433	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0232469_0232617	the full name and then it speaks
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0259873_0260094	but um uh it should be fine
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0234609_0234815	just yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0239583_0240106	it's a uh information of an end text uh interface
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0012507_0012860	um i think there is
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0263546_0263744	and i think it would
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0226386_0226994	nei uh you know to to search for a u specific p specific user you have to hold your mouse over that one
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0038361_0038476	so i'm gonna use this
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0241021_0241212	well not great fun
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0224316_0224556	uh no it's not at all i think
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0236191_0236358	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0276454_0276627	which is the hardest anyway
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0171408_0171523	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0227069_0227251	yeah that's true
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0138033_0138314	so who would have the um ideas
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0091466_0092196	more money yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0114980_0115106	now but why do we want default
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0254982_0255215	is she connecting them
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0026979_0027329	like when he was talking about like have an architect that things are gonna plug into
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0089444_0090063	it it's a bit dumb if you can fool it if you c if you c load up ten different si engines simultaneously
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0261428_0261548	it'll be nice at the end
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0113546_0114127	or well the thing is i mean just be looking for a word uh yeah like in if it shows up ten different meetings
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0216266_0216811	um but i'm i'm i'm not sure about how to how to put all the information in there
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0060036_0060147	okay
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0020877_0021528	so the d the who the speakers that are at the meetings and the amount they speak and then the average is a combined with the speakers
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0074427_0074693	did it in my directory just uh just do that yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0191168_0191313	oh want that first meeting
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0059579_0060210	they can load each w all of the whole up and then a search of the whole lot to find who participated in what no problem or what topics we're in what
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0148152_0148272	oh i see
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0105814_0106146	and through that once you've got the results you click on something and that lies out with us
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0003721_0003846	okay
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0050663_0050813	okay
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0199424_0199910	yeah okay yeah that's yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0018339_0018522	okay i'll do it
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0185916_0186115	oh mm-hmm
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0143082_0143247	okay
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0181663_0182241	so i can just sort out a task back and figure what objects they are and bring 'em into here
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0058705_0058934	both a lot alls like twenty five
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0130510_0130868	we need to use each other
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0122613_0122772	shall we make it up monday
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0154007_0154164	detail for simplicity of final report
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0061732_0062279	and so i just say one of the boxes is explained 'cause this is my top five dollars for the speaker
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0127956_0128207	yes
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0014843_0015002	um three is 'kay
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0130181_0130389	that's anyway only gonna be half an hour maybe
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0033821_0034404	ah properly it to save it in broke that didn't break too i didn't play that long but seemed alright already yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0094723_0094995	yeah i think you should give it a fan name and it tells it it knows
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0077673_0078155	um yeah i just have to i just finished they might be some pollution
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0018749_0018957	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0086606_0086931	we could uh the only thing i could think of was an em
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0027218_0027489	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0080798_0081025	it like for your stuff do you have no
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0214288_0214589	uh w organise it by time not by speaker
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0079280_0079699	well so it'll use is my part as well my um titanium
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0040120_0040237	oh yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0193337_0193727	we'll just um if there's like three of the top meetings like we c like we said before
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0211992_0212200	it did look a lot of what uh a mission really
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0089864_0090401	and i mean it's tiny so we can't really put more than one calculator really or one sort of simple give
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0097654_0098357	actually have you ever managed oh yeah you must have yeah you gotta plainly sort of music on the dice machines
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0205438_0205932	yeah uh that was li like yeah if i make a just index
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0137988_0138094	if you find the people
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0163258_0164252	because this i mean we have interior report of seven pages and that's we can yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0112103_0112218	yeah exactly
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0111155_0111299	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0205767_0205902	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0208316_0209096	but we're not gonna be we won't be l doing a global search on the topics for our topics since they don't have labels
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0044253_0044625	have done stuff like that before it's insane it's insane
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0100849_0100972	okay
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0112911_0113066	yeah that's true
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0044653_0045256	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0150594_0150724	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0043909_0044253	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0039715_0040133	but that took me so long to do this bluetooth one anyway
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0012207_0012328	how is this supposed to be
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0214959_0215201	so i don't know really what we're gonna do about that
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0115201_0115311	think i guess that's not
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0160131_0160714	did he say anything about like what he expects of the final report and stuff
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0195571_0195821	and if we can yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0028244_0028456	has anyone had time to to play with it
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0148058_0148276	uh s it's just funny that you have it finish by monday
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0038566_0038773	and think it would look better on windows as well actually
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0143567_0143766	no evaluation i'm gonna say
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0062279_0062926	and then in the meeting you have what you could either have the most commonly acquiring ones or you could have a list of each speakers top deluxe
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0040229_0040610	so i'm quite glad that it looks you know n nice on one remote or this kind of thing
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0093153_0093342	is it just basic little okay
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0131310_0131482	have more of a break
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0153143_0153293	oh actually i might have this stuff yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0138306_0139183	and another thing um we have the we have the um the presentation on like in one and a half weeks or something whatever is
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0209491_0209673	yeah all the labelled two s yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0043889_0044535	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0146247_0146629	we should aim to be finished by monday this monday coming
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0136947_0137425	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0125814_0126195	at the end we'll say you but you never gave us any tests objectives
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0007291_0007454	yeah mine isn't stuck today either
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0173882_0174181	and then if you i don't know double click on one
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0108360_0109058	but feels like it's it's a job of course more than anything else
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0141775_0142184	it's not a good friday
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0026667_0026774	okay
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0068205_0068504	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0142418_0142656	oh so it wasn't originally either
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0206489_0206636	well it it kinda makes sense
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0118486_0118681	ah i'm sure we could do that in like a meeting
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0140242_0140610	um i thought uh evaluation maybe for the report
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0182533_0182797	because the the transcription window does cross highlighting
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0207760_0207915	we are still doing our topic segment
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0031119_0031314	um yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0126228_0126447	well so he's supposed to give us test subject
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0169404_0169517	well i i will
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0210871_0211092	like if you're creating if you're creating excel files that is
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0123383_0123515	but um
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0089082_0089224	oh no
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0025643_0025952	how's on zapping all these kind of crazy huge things that were innovated
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0027476_0027982	it's just much better than all of our home directories combined
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0027116_0027389	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0032835_0033593	um but if it's a real area then it it stops so you can't do any anymore uh
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0025310_0025643	oh the they live there but there's i had even more stuff there already
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0023032_0023273	yeah i 'cause i saw it again today is just a s that was me
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0209740_0209951	okay
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0174744_0175073	and i mean how to get that that communication between the two different kinds of windows
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0145965_0146120	that's the yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0146629_0146885	the week no yeah well basically for the audience
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0023621_0024047	did you don't wanna remove that just
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0118504_0118703	and could actually be fun
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0083604_0084156	have one one m one little question that i reckon we should have a little icon for our browser
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0035151_0035394	so i didn't didn't take it for a full test drive yet
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0165915_0166112	so i don't think
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0086848_0086949	yeah i know yes
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0189484_0190231	because you d you don't you only ever have one meeting open and those reports will be op uh well i suppose if you have a t if you have a local search
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0017470_0017772	yeah the fun and games
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0151464_0151692	okay
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0063541_0063654	well you could have now you don't need that
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0055107_0056001	and then each meeting knows about all the different dialogue acts for each person in the meeting and the amount that that occurred
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0211507_0211992	um i did have a look at today to create exam files
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0150359_0150594	and i mean i'm not even worried about that
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0069674_0070291	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0151432_0151652	it's you
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0069241_0069415	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0097278_0097652	now uh
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0073526_0073733	so i just called that will
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0078493_0078683	so you can stop using that s whatever
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0151929_0152096	okay
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0091278_0092182	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0048815_0049448	so the fir one statement is the t it will b i'd removed it 'cause it it was li everything is prefixed by station
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0046770_0046985	but it's good your your stuff is really good good
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0026083_0026667	it's alright but
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0090402_0090808	 anyway have any um artistic talent
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0210340_0210705	but don't think we can expect you to also come up with a search thingy for it as well
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0019388_0019671	think browse is for the rest of your nice
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0130067_0130510	so yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0129539_0129786	well they're your friends so they should
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0154502_0154676	well now you can
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0088236_0089082	uh yeah that would be good
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0110038_0110335	rubber
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0038021_0038352	nei it's not it's not um it's not a top priority
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0103034_0103425	we'll see what happens in the next two days
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0162181_0162365	yeah it's gonna be a lot
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0082282_0082406	yeah yeah doesn't matter
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0066256_0066714	but it's t some m often the interesting ones don't occur things like jog nokia very often
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0212200_0212531	that's but it's not it's it's a straight forward is writing an x. m. l. part
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0097451_0097610	can we get sound on these machines
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0006588_0006734	okay
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0057447_0057616	um so i don't know what we want to display
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0080298_0080635	yeah i was thinking that um it's sort of turned out that way a bit didn't it
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0050682_0050792	well i don't know what that means
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0104744_0105104	like to be looking through the highest ranked ones first
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0040968_0041094	okay and that's
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0187847_0187994	highlights um yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0091487_0091840	some people no i know some amount of people
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0047380_0047894	the um the the dialogue acts are all done in the nano i'm using some of it
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0042029_0042437	haven't done it i haven't updated all those object files yet because it takes ages on these computers
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0004900_0005215	oh
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0002063_0002511	forget every time
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0218498_0218791	then i mean just get work done
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0183290_0183584	that was that was a pain
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0143624_0143738	oh okay
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0218791_0218984	think that's what i've gotta do
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0205710_0205844	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0207310_0207511	or is that sort of con like my own topic segment
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0069235_0069446	okay
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0144807_0144937	because if not then
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0194615_0195308	um so the the results from that will you know narrow down what we're gonna use for the local search
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0007053_0007312	oh okay
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0153647_0153757	yeah a third of twenty four
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0169906_0170600	well i will i will need your snaps of code or if you could if i had them by tomorrow evening
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0043448_0043867	wh what can you can you can you connect to your home machine from here and then start it from there
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0034404_0034674	and it the the f the top ups green is quite good it looks alright
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0174429_0174744	it's like that's that's the other big part
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0190932_0191506	because you know if you get back several different meetings here and you've only got one meeting open then you can't cross fire anything
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0210701_0210871	well now it would be kinda straight forward
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0188570_0188695	the transcript or whatever it is
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0083101_0083343	so sorry
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0051370_0051605	um and then the other i c
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0201930_0202490	just just take that away the the logical check box
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0085342_0085510	yeah we have something else
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0026982_0027116	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0044972_0045397	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0032314_0032693	uh think when you when you left click or right click or something i can't remember now
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0117920_0118139	come up with scenarios that's sort of thing
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0178574_0178779	is that how it works in the others
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0058348_0058783	just say okay well show all or show you know only the im interesting ones
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0024183_0024302	but i so it doesn't matter really
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0021506_0022321	because i think i was 'cause i was trying some stuff uh couple of weeks ago uh so that may be mine
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0185645_0185769	you could take that for loading
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0154016_0154252	the planning on have a big party on the twenty first
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0065511_0066137	um but then we want a selection of three or four maybe interesting ones and then
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0164008_0164164	time period
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0179185_0179812	usually one leather it's highlite it costs a lot everything i think
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0036835_0037111	but uh that doesn't it doesn't matter
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0028945_0029123	uh now i was kids really
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0072533_0072653	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0036363_0036835	the only the only thing is th it's not the start up screen is not too pretty
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0067023_0067170	one guy has top five jobs
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0110371_0110848	and i mean sometimes they have methods that don't have any explanation to them at all
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0151652_0152009	yeah i don't know that it's a we
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0017545_0017761	it's just i don't know it seems a little casual
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0165717_0166013	yeah that could be yeah that could easily be like five or six page
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0206073_0206264	yeah i didn't think it would be over that but yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0122211_0122354	we'll try and do something
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0098687_0098797	if
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0202466_0202569	to have for the start up
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0210998_0211183	but if i calculate yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0206444_0206625	but yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0135769_0136076	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0026232_0026377	how's our code on that one
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0157274_0157747	is is that is that a part of the demonstration they want that information evaluation as part of the yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0097588_0097750	oh that
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0178969_0179185	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0027366_0027487	yeah so now uh yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0096153_0096712	they know it's a distinctive s distinctive experience i guess
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0088088_0088254	suppose size of meeting browser
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0043872_0044186	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0220281_0220403	three
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0141076_0141216	oh it's the last thing
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0100972_0101247	um okay well this this looks good
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0025952_0026083	and needed them they were for this time
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0118703_0118805	yeah exactly
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0087458_0087887	whatever i seem to have seen that before
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0106975_0107255	maybe i'll try
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0175946_0176441	um that was why i was sort of deciding to give the three pains in there instead of just the one
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0073946_0074059	and the software it's boring
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0133975_0134636	like the thing is like did an e. t. i. cost a while ago and it says that's what they s yeah those three people
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0100450_0100612	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0142694_0142974	well i'm sorry on the website it says today
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0217585_0217717	okay
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0056001_0056677	and we'll give you that in top order as well or we'll give you or you can just search for each specific dialogue act
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0148916_0149051	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0109005_0109126	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0031013_0031119	might as well yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0113883_0114458	so p did we have a date for when we actually want the system done
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0059782_0060580	but it would be difficult if you know if in the um speaker calculator we had a heading you know top five dollar acts
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0076024_0076748	yeah i mean just keep it simple as
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0040826_0040967	now this is just yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0131482_0131772	so that might be an idea get a range of types a people as well
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0174233_0174429	it doesn't do anything yet
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0216482_0217203	see what steeps says about the eval evaluation and then like we'll keep in touch by email if we need
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0162406_0162725	although it's fifty percent of the mark i think is it
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0187994_0188550	uh mean uh h obviously highlights whatever you've clicked on here but also highlights um
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0080103_0080384	just reflex with an arm and or
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0118139_0118504	and i mean that's that's fairly straight forward
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0132102_0132203	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0166261_0166473	potentially it's gonna be probab
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0099842_0099951	from time to time it works yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0135096_0135215	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0203017_0203143	yeah local anyway yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0050983_0051183	so when they say m uh yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0090954_0091434	do you think we'd be doing uh m. l. c. s in finances if we did
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0004996_0005368	oh i saved it
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0148522_0148694	yes
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0204919_0205171	so you're gonna be able to do a global search for topics
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0109484_0109629	yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0016966_0017340	um getting a better feel for all these nice objects
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0041480_0041897	well the um the um speak circuitry is finished
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0091917_0092258	maybe i'll check if i can find anyway
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0126933_0127272	ha yeah find some people that's how i understood it
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0150022_0150518	that's the p. c.
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0018272_0018612	then you st spend the time to invest and learn all about them but it's like okay
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0191550_0191944	although yeah this this will uh this is actually different from how we printed it up here
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0193267_0193395	what do you mean by multi like
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0130060_0130210	yeah that's true
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0085510_0085735	just pull a little microphone off give like uh
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0038183_0038603	if you if you t if you change your window manager it might look a little bit nicer
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0015416_0015672	so so those will be able to play with
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0197295_0197410	if not it can't
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0002952_0003133	but rainbow
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0156649_0156753	we should have it done anyway
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0110304_0110440	that's my believe is well
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0008509_0008640	um
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0087488_0088107	it would be sued for that i think
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0039372_0039778	actually can we run it on windows
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0133554_0133668	thirteen
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0135407_0135572	it's i don't want to p
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0084666_0084871	like instead of the
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0142276_0142587	it's not a good friday if it's the deadline
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0081562_0081701	now it's just gonna curve
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0140752_0140882	twenty five is is it
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0088280_0088700	okay mm-hmm
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0155338_0155536	only one fancy right in him an email
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0024880_0025008	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0075358_0075462	alright okay
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0069860_0070409	that would be quite good that's it
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0192057_0192623	then we are gonna do it like how we said before and pop up a list of the very meetings that found those terms
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0124769_0124899	maybe it's just a delay anyway
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0127272_0127400	um the thing is you know
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0054120_0054797	but that's the thing i said i wanted to know whether or not we 'cause at the moment you can get there's a method that will just give you the top five for or the top exit
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0209132_0209233	exactly
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0057819_0058348	or i don't know if we have like a a choice so they can filter those out f the the top most common
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0145491_0145868	otherwise you just start to getting the t light otherwise
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0018894_0019151	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0137769_0137988	um but yeah if he finds them then that's cool
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0067300_0067832	uh-huh huh-huh
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0114977_0115151	okay
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0054020_0054141	like three four or something
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0136194_0136389	yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0100254_0100450	yes
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0133368_0133554	oh i think you know like ten
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0059149_0059684	oh in do we do we care if you know why don't w i think you know it'll be it'd be difficult
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0021504_0021700	oh my god
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0103314_0103778	and we're gonna be uh trying to get the output from that and i don't know still haven't found out if it's enough
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0120589_0120727	and that would give us the whole week end
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0149456_0149558	oh the next one okay
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0190572_0190694	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0144673_0144807	we should definitely ask him
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0125261_0125430	although do we really want the answer
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0074059_0074781	and also the other thing that they have is um if somebody quotes something so if i quote a joke to you they separate that
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0203575_0203798	everything else can just stay the same you know
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0207919_0208441	well we're certainly do it enough to make it so we can do some numerical analysis on it yeah at at the very least
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0012988_0013625	they did i was trying to i didn't have publications to get in to update your file
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0025312_0025661	and
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0148526_0148668	exactly me two
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0126709_0126933	he would he would make something up
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0050792_0050952	who knows what b back channel
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0064597_0064749	yeah yeah yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0124267_0124755	he's not a round this week is it uh that's why i think that's why we didn't have the the meeting
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0117427_0117920	well we yeah i guess we can still come up with like test cases or whatever for for the people and just yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0140712_0140962	it's oh right is that th is that the friday
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0207511_0207760	like since we can't do the labelling and all the rest
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0159599_0160018	have you got people ha for us or what you thinking and when
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0144408_0144537	uh wouldn't i wouldn't assume
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0145641_0145965	yeah that's p it's a good target
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0043276_0043666	but it does i have to sit in the lap and wait half an hour or whatever it takes
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0033643_0033841	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0141119_0141248	it's twenty four then
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0170935_0171105	oh i was gonna ask um
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0108805_0109267	it's a dolphin
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0164978_0165201	just a finance or detailed and yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0013625_0014060	ah w i i actually meant to i missed to sent the email and then i just can didn't get around it so
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0121032_0121596	oh yeah you have your
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0067986_0068106	th this is good for browsing now
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0176802_0177381	well this this is the icon by the way
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0149671_0149979	oh we have th three
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0054797_0055107	you give it in another number and it will give you the total whatever for each person
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0110848_0111427	so you just like right i'll try this then and see what it gives me
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0035525_0035715	that's well right after this yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0202278_0202422	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0084638_0084829	like that you
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0202681_0202785	tap for the start up
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0126563_0126708	he said he mu he would try
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0017761_0018272	oh no that's just it's um i don't it's it's like if you're gonna use this stuff later on in your life
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0165633_0165800	that's gonna be quite of few cases
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0036863_0037115	uh a lot of this j. v. stuff is isn't it
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0162302_0162513	um i mean how long we're this
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0157128_0157274	hopefully but yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0167850_0168296	and uh when i get home today which will be before
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0150813_0151225	and uh you must have your research published
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0004201_0004336	think this is the one i go to there
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0060580_0061211	and then a little brackets but they're not actually the top five but top five minus the most common ones which are you know
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0094287_0094388	just just in the main frame
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0105104_0105252	so if we are gonna look through only five of 'em
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0132751_0132990	so how many people do we gonna try and 'cause
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0209151_0209429	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0109808_0110031	how do you guys find the documentation for the next t. n.
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0139417_0139544	two six
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0219012_0219251	we can just email if we need
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0147364_0147545	because yeah and then get um
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0103900_0104113	feasible to open up more than one
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0075513_0075642	that's not a real joke anyway
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0195308_0195571	then we'll just do the local circuit on those ones that are not used
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0130680_0130898	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0095345_0095469	yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0014324_0014843	yeah i yeah 'cause i forget mine as well and it's just like you know every time I put something in there
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0078503_0078649	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0081261_0081362	but i can change that you want
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0059504_0059733	well if we just automatically filter these out
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0019753_0020065	yeah mm
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0025008_0025238	turns turns
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0031056_0031237	so it's just kinda doesn't really do anything
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0030007_0030205	but that didn't cost any problems but it just
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0163144_0163258	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0069679_0069860	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0112756_0112904	uh without having to look at the cost price
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0052391_0052733	they're a slip i think
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0027676_0027902	yeah exactly
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0119597_0120310	but we won't be able to do any evaluation during the week end anyway so i think we could set money
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0063146_0063342	but it would start to take a lot of space if you have it
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0108083_0108360	that didn't expect this curve to be so much but turbo
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0209642_0209821	yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0015672_0016188	still working on the um trying to get the topics and summary succinct implemented as well
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0152163_0152341	um so um
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0188848_0188969	oh she's difficult because
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0202490_0202650	because um
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0082941_0083101	just look it's in the same directory it works
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0120899_0121052	yeah it's okay
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0157793_0158247	and we need to know that anyway to prepare the presentation in the first place
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0200307_0200435	that should be
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0200435_0200738	it's just realise i have an don't worry about it
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0148594_0149073	it's like it's like if we had yeah a bit more time
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0015002_0015254	that was the main thing so um as soon as that's in it'll be ready
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0074781_0075165	so they put they put the the the digital back then they put a doub a colour on and they put that aside
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0123133_0123383	well probably have to talk to steve at some point as well i guess
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0185971_0186525	so if we have that um the same on this one at at least that you if you double left click then it loads
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0132565_0132750	so it's a wider range of people
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0052411_0052523	but
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0212531_0212781	so it's but it's organising the segment data that
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0076880_0077078	um
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0099902_0100259	let's i guess that's why we have a separate speech lab
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0096156_0096516	yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0095198_0095345	yeah yeah just tick it in the corner
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0127010_0127175	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0156342_0156473	that yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0137207_0137686	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0081863_0082071	we could put it in a s in a package
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0209408_0209642	the yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0136592_0136905	and one i don't know
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0034674_0034783	it's uh yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0118805_0119034	that's true just brainstorm yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0027357_0027476	so yeah it's not possible
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0095016_0095251	oh so it'll do the automatic scrolling down of its bigger
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0052538_0052702	okay
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0072044_0072846	what presents is the dialogue acts that he makes our jokes in the meeting and globally separately so one's clearly will
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0082410_0082679	well it doesn't seem to mark any different i'm never ever use double packages
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0104113_0104744	as many mm norm objects as we can for each meeting to do like we're gonna like figure that the ranking did make sense
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0039518_0039783	nei
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0176699_0177347	yeah so so there's a couple of those little things as well yeah it's it's beautiful
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0100744_0100849	oh
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0132950_0133165	and i don't think it's think like three or four maybe
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0125430_0125786	so so we don't ask we push it off and
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0134790_0135144	then you can do a massive amount of analysis on three people
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0195663_0195780	oh i see what you mean yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0038603_0038718	it's
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0121052_0121445	yeah i've i've got my d. n. l. e. presentation on monday
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0135848_0136057	one art student
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0039504_0039938	yes it is
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0149119_0149585	well i'm not afraid after this money but i'm free it like after the eighteen
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0203393_0203597	that's that's quite straight forward
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0164252_0164518	we could probably just expand that
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0189392_0189561	it even if we could just
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0059098_0059276	totally guys
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0209233_0209491	li label all the label one
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0063991_0064404	so you've got the global one there and then here you can just have the top five in this meeting
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0112554_0112756	it's a little it's good to know what methods are there so
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0076813_0076935	the
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0022410_0023001	doesn't have anything in it i have a look at it oh it does it has about three lines of x. m. l. that don't do much
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0101446_0102253	oh i'm running in some troubles with the icon but uh f found another package i instead of writing it from um the scratch
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0100305_0100661	yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0129630_0130067	they're gonna need us for like perception project and things like that
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0011917_0012147	okay
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0180420_0180825	then like just find it in the programme and just say okay just how this one does it
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0097042_0097588	it did it well to the meeting but
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0116565_0116699	yeah think about that yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0114458_0115163	tho i thought i thought we said th i thought we'd ch yeah i thought we'd change it to the tent or something
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0147092_0147205	um right
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0024270_0024714	give you false impressions of what happen is something that's going on
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0118798_0118957	and make it up together
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0210877_0210998	wait uh
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0214589_0214771	but
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0052876_0053288	sebastien have an organisation is a big one that comes up all the time yes no questions
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0124630_0124769	and then
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0079699_0080103	it actually do have to have like naming convention for s our source files
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0109501_0109808	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0190231_0190333	then it could cross light
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0094007_0094383	yeah yeah yeah i i know yeah i know how to how to put it there
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0202772_0202979	yeah because in the start of screen you can't have it
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0052095_0052411	actually you can see that they don't do that and it's the bottom of their list
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0152986_0153581	um just that's why i'm trying to find his his dates
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0057267_0057447	but i can change that
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0142163_0142403	easy two d yeah no
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0129220_0129630	well they they're gonna u need us
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0115809_0115932	shouldn't it um
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0084289_0084638	what that you can double click on it oh no
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0129674_0129833	yeah yeah i know but
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0052524_0052865	it's just very quiet
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0109184_0109734	in fact it's uh an excel package
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0066714_0067023	well they do sometimes but they're not that common
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0051559_0051733	well it's kinda boring yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0120308_0120594	yeah that would be reasonable
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0133528_0133914	now it would take for every uh and then he got analyse the results
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0143446_0143624	the report yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0206507_0207067	well uh i mean i um it's not first priority maybe but i don't know
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0033537_0033821	but i did have a look
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0020970_0021307	it's an excel s. x. s. dot x. l. s. file
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0015254_0015416	are we making a couple of little changes as well
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0114513_0115039	which changes it to fight it
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0109126_0109300	productive job eh
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0089751_0089873	yeah anything you like yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0038773_0039024	because uh y charger use is the native windows doesn't it
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0107864_0108008	that's it
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0087619_0087884	alright
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0197254_0197407	yes yes
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0127630_0127793	yeah right yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0033675_0033797	good
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0011754_0011982	um no um okay
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0082679_0082941	doesn't matter
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0155756_0155884	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0195821_0196372	so it it will be a bit different from from how that is right now one when we do the global survey at least
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0092623_0092786	otherwise i'll i'll make up some em
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0169604_0169952	so i'm not trying to remember to do that to my own
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0133263_0133368	meeting
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0098936_0099810	if the sound card is registered to your name which it usually is not and you have to reboot sometimes it still doesn't work um yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0150257_0150782	because because because i don't have anything after the eighteen apart from this
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0139544_0139677	two two two seats today
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0135305_0135407	oh yes
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0197407_0197508	exactly yep
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0005140_0005279	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0141500_0141952	even though it's good friday i think okay
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0188300_0188413	oh just the top in
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0059359_0059504	uh don't know yeah it doesn't really matter
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0199631_0199794	it just like oh
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0132330_0132565	think that might be good as well
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0018957_0019079	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0209246_0209408	exactly
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0120773_0120899	to work on it as well
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0139766_0140033	do we have to have done the evaluation by then
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0126439_0126709	well sort of that's how i understand it
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0030441_0031056	it just prints everything out in the in the shell as well like i guess it does everything it just kinda i guess that's it's default behaviour anyway
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0041310_0041492	that's nasty that
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0023775_0024183	it just ends the meeting
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0130370_0130504	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0209821_0209934	now we c uh
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0111299_0112231	and it uh it's was it's was a plain generator by going to generate java doc and just put sp it all out and they never bother to uh
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0026882_0026983	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0081701_0081885	um think about future top maybe if
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0075165_0075639	just ignore any t any quieted material 'cause it's got nothing to do with i just scrap it
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0141791_0141925	is that good friday already
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0045916_0046646	let's say that it it it does tells tells you what speakers uh in which meeting and then you can see which topics which topics yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0016188_0016478	so that's that's sort of tonight as well
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0017772_0017917	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0016478_0016680	so um yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0125070_0125180	they probably will do anyway
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0019703_0020121	to reach deeper uh-huh
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0049448_0050088	every single dial out stops with state and um so everybody's top priority is the top priority
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0184682_0185363	and um and that works when you when you left double click on a topic or on a meeting sorry then it loads
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0179927_0180420	if you have like a particular window that you want to want to mic it's behaviour
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0056677_0057267	but you have to search on in bees and cays rather than real words at the moment
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0091434_0092082	so for two yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0097092_0097278	oh yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0019391_0019703	take your project
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0182347_0182533	now it's difficult
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0155209_0155380	so twenty four so i we sh
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0068407_0068548	let's say you're doing what
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0142656_0143082	so yeah okay
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0035556_0035682	yeah we could
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0137628_0137769	uh god
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0148276_0148594	because after monday i'm pretty much free for about a week or so
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0029599_0030007	it uh generate a lot of exceptions in the background
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0144537_0144643	but we should ask 'em
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0202422_0202634	that's actually fairly
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0025012_0025312	yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0203227_0203393	so yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0011420_0012024	was that uh answer i c
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0047894_0048815	but there's some of them some of the th the thing actually what i want to talk about is um they are some that appear all the time that i'm just and i don't know how interesting they are
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0034811_0035151	oh it's more less just playing with the things that i had to do directly with what i was doing
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0096698_0096891	oh yes
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0105967_0106108	exactly right now
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0192899_0193337	choose the one we wanna actually do this i think multi select would make the most sense
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0158872_0159599	basically how is how is it going with your evaluation for example
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0020309_0020675	there is a file in the directory called digital
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0064997_0065404	yeah just do talk five both local and global and then have another
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0046985_0047241	it's got a good interface and is use
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0171732_0172201	just basic um pretty much like the iron do you wanna do have the iron still
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0027076_0027357	yeah so it's about yeah it's that i think it's about eight kicks on there
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0031602_0032314	there is still this one arrow which is a bug in in an n. x. t. um that r always generates these
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0031314_0031602	the thing is that yeah there is as i said a while ago
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0191944_0192057	like if we're doing a double circuit
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0198555_0199395	um it should be very simple to just get the topics and the summaries f using that text extractor thing you wrote right
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0173159_0173266	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0193727_0194086	language we're looking for the word language and give the highest rated ones
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0127211_0128210	it's 'cause we're gonna give an email on our i. m. s. e. list so for t. v. we need a remote yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0026400_0026858	oh it's huge seven kick i think
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0107140_0107443	if you can make it work then i will be well shifted
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0006734_0007677	keep an eye if i'm dropping this because it's as i said it doesn't seem very s oh as i said it doesn't seem
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0024953_0025451	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0068535_0068751	yeah see you that's what speaker calculation gives you
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0063654_0063991	so it's 'cause it's 'cause it's it's a speak of window the speak the colouration because activation when it comes up
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0092316_0092511	well if you find anything then send it to me
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0123949_0124267	like we could send them in email but i don't know if he's around even
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0205569_0205767	is that what you mean yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0129224_0129346	it's hard finding people
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0162887_0162990	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0209934_0210340	well yeah even if even if i happen to manage to make it do some key words
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0036931_0037073	yeah i know
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0085748_0086228	oh we want something original
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0053288_0053572	um um well let's come up
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0157584_0157793	yeah yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0137425_0137628	the call for
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0211183_0211507	yeah if i create the excel files but i don't i'm not gonna do that
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0104085_0104232	yeah we'd think about that
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0143656_0144109	well you know the the question is it do we need the evaluation for the presentation
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0160714_0160855	like links or
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0087460_0088218	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0052523_0052876	and uh
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0068919_0069261	it's like i'm all the interested in this guy 'cause he seems to be funny
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0068152_0068407	imagine that's sorry exactly what you want to do and look at these things
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0084458_0084804	well no a thing is um in the yeah the top left
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0102253_0102750	because you can i don't know um just now but i haven't played around it that much
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0121866_0122045	well but yeah money
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0217410_0217555	actually we'll see you on the thursday
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0152281_0152785	in our uh time line we're written twenty five and that's the friday i think
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0061270_0061732	uh think we should have the global top five that 'cause it the each piece is got up a top whatever
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0016680_0016966	uh oh then that it's rather come along
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0218169_0218366	do we need another meeting this week
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0116932_0117417	well that's the problem because steve hasn't given us any details has he
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0187581_0187863	so one left click just highlights it's that sort of
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0105485_0105663	uh-huh
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0082770_0082939	yeah exactly
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0150724_0150827	yeah okay
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0105252_0105882	just pick the top five to to do the the circuit and since that's probably what we're looking for anyway
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0075639_0075772	yeah yeah somebody else is jokes
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0121596_0121866	it's too much now
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0107820_0108083	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0144144_0144408	i didn't think so especially
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0098758_0098971	you have them on the front too i think
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0154557_0154768	and of lectures
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0131772_0132330	like not like highly computer l like not you know electronics literate or yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0069749_0070202	okay
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0147696_0147872	and we have to write the report yeah and everything
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0114442_0114592	the today wasn't it
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0212781_0213044	it would just look so complicated to get it from
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0033553_0033856	okay
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0157162_0157354	but it's still important to know
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0136859_0137042	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0090892_0090996	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0078649_0079199	and when i upload my design i'll just uh re.compile the ambers and then just um get that
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0133153_0133265	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0093450_0094076	you do it in um one of the whatever the main window is you do set g give or so se zap zap picture or something
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0113268_0113370	just that's it
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0200781_0201493	is it d very difficult to make another another gooey but only for a global search
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0073347_0073526	another of them could be a z which means my label
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0063316_0063513	now i wouldn't yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0081369_0081562	it doesn't m no it does matter at this point
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0094383_0094598	but you can't use it anymore
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0053528_0054020	so which w you know suggest maybe you can suggest a few that which which would be interesting to list
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0125696_0125814	exactly yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0151069_0151276	well that's in on the eighteenth
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0024562_0025175	had lots of stuff in there already
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0043111_0043280	that's all there
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0130898_0131310	actually some other fronts are mine in different programmes might be more willing
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0148668_0148771	that's the point
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0023456_0023857	um but you can yeah that was that's yeah sure
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0169143_0169262	yeah no no big rush
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0023273_0023456	yeah i think that was me i think so
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0084804_0085504	at the moment they've got an exit which is you know an exit to use that
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0119308_0119597	the thing is yeah we had the the deadline as Friday
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0121445_0121759	you have to read the paper
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0011518_0011696	now that's just silver
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0077116_0077494	okay that's on the so that's sort of implemented now or is that articul
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0139470_0139766	oh it's ju yeah it's two weeks then
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0155884_0156315	um just to ask whether we need to have the evaluation done for the demonstration
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0024302_0024419	that's a p in there
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0050087_0050345	well we didn't won't include that then
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0019590_0019753	thi th yeah right
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0155026_0155150	so
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0141247_0141500	but i thought it's a ten i thought he said twenty five
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0183744_0184682	and um when you when you um right click on a topic it pops open the list of meetings that contain that pop p p topic
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0141940_0142114	yeah that's good idea
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0149558_0149960	so yeah i'm three this after this menu and it's well
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0095446_0096325	we have to remember to include that in our evaluation how did the give uh improve your browsing experience
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0202155_0202278	range
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0216053_0216169	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0073056_0073347	um i think most things are coded with the digital card
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0146055_0146174	yeah you might be right
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0126030_0126220	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0160938_0161185	um just made some comments the last meeting
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0136076_0136194	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0017326_0017470	oh
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0089258_0089791	just probably basic just text font um just something nice something solid maybe
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0021106_0021208	uh think i yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0172507_0172809	but at the beginning uh when you have to search yet
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0172201_0172565	just um sorta like google type thing and just um oh
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0099304_0099420	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0072390_0072533	it jokes
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0028508_0028614	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0042437_0042884	so do it it's faster for some design reasons if i log in at home and then run the code
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0091249_0091487	it's possible some people are willing to accept it
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0160781_0160938	um there f a few little things
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0018612_0018924	it's the minimum i can get away with that that will get me what we need
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0155606_0155728	oh it's actually twenty four
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0129036_0129224	yeah if they have time
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0194086_0194615	actually look for the terms we're not loading it out of all seventy six me or sixty five whatever it is
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0037073_0037439	at the moment as well the whole windows that pop up are not pretty too
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0141278_0141396	so it's not the yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0028023_0028142	um i don't know
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0178779_0179183	and like the other windows like the very like um if we're in the topic
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0201665_0201959	um so that we search two different
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0136905_0137789	uh
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0138094_0138215	yeah um
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0149960_0150359	uh what else uh that's that's easy compared to the other stuff
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0013593_0013694	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0151225_0151432	is that on the internet
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0004128_0004707	what did my oh s it's stopped yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0088279_0088765	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0038026_0038251	so i will if
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0096862_0097042	could even have some sound when it comes on again
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0162869_0163120	um i mean i think we should we should write everything
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0075840_0076024	yes
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0164660_0164909	im mean 'cause i i mean a lot of it's gonna be the same thing
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0088262_0088398	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0020117_0020297	 anyway so um yeah that's about that
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0026983_0027218	should run the email and that directory
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0136275_0136593	okay
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0137042_0137183	and then we should just have two
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0146885_0147214	still the evaluation it's pretty much straight away and then get
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0035394_0035525	but uh i can do that
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0115163_0115809	um 'cause the thing is i mean we can keep working on little things f you know and so oh we should
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0010815_0011006	who wants to
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0169501_0169604	although it's just to get into the way
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0125543_0125696	yeah uh
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0050314_0050682	and then everybody the next one seems to mostly be back channel
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0092806_0093153	how do you s add that to the to the garage programme
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0140610_0140752	so then that's done on the twenty five
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0137100_0137490	yeah one man one woman
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0013694_0013806	yeah forgot that i still
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0069493_0069749	let's take 'em into next project
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0165229_0165633	and then i mean write about the evalu evaluation and stuff
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0133872_0133975	yeah exactly it's
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0130210_0130370	yeah that's true
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0057616_0057967	that's what i think that that's what i'm asking you right
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0018924_0019419	so it's like i don't know s unless i wanna do something with this in the future
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0012024_0012207	but okay
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0062130_0062233	for the speaker
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0172809_0173357	is it is it just is it still divided into two and the bottom half is just just empty
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0141075_0141211	know the first i think
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0122354_0122457	um i mean we could
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0152773_0153143	maybe that is us then not him
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0093222_0093399	oh i'm not sure anyway
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0069233_0069679	yeah it's okay
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0107377_0107864	so yeah that'd that'd be expensive 'cause i'm bad at job
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0007677_0008425	uh maybe if i set it here on the this brand thing
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0161997_0162216	that expect some more ten to fifteen pages
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0067354_0067828	you filled out all this out
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0161535_0161657	but yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0136389_0136592	there are ones supposed to be women it must be
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0139359_0139538	yeah it's twelve they twenty second
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0012309_0012442	oh right this one okay
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0141952_0142066	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0096155_0096418	yes
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0175461_0175946	because the thing is if we have different things in here like transcepts versus summaries versus topics
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0123581_0123733	just like
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0028614_0028945	how do i apply it um yesterday
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0086016_0086731	oh
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0199655_0200097	let's just do topics instead of s yeah you have to get the topics out instead of the segments
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0098317_0098701	now no but i think if you put headphones in you'll just play just normally
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0177347_0177529	yeah and makes more sense
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0131849_0132005	maybe yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0140970_0141080	that's what i understood
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0071373_0072234	oh no twenty is that the ha what percentage of his speech is jog or wha what percentage of the jokes
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0033280_0033537	uh yeah i didn't cover anymore on the l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0097105_0097311	you can
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0080941_0081261	now i'm just just called meeting and speaker
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0145149_0145491	uh we should have it we should try and have it it done by then anyway i think
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0181008_0181185	um well it's difficult because
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0161185_0161535	just generally like how it all integrates blah blah blah this kind of stuff
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0206625_0206726	yeah that doesn't
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0109058_0109200	that's just like oh
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0149560_0149671	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0106821_0106975	are you serious
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0067735_0067906	oh
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0025175_0025310	it's the problem
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0090808_0090936	now
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0051521_0051791	uh don't know if that's very useful because everyone does it
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0051947_0052095	there are some people who don't do that
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0030281_0030441	like are we keeping that how that happens
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0167052_0167284	so do you wanna write me in email then
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0158247_0158353	and um
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0025880_0026232	it's alright
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0116104_0116933	so i don't do we want to set an actual hard deadline for like d d when exactly were we gonna start evaluation
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0203231_0203342	yeah would you make that
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0171289_0171434	at the moment you'll search window
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0147522_0147750	because we need to write a presentation as well
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0099271_0099427	um
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0003133_0003297	what they sp oh this
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0207915_0208053	well you are you are i guess
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0204669_0204942	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0037439_0038026	but um you know i would make them a bit nice if i had more time but at the moment it doesn't look like that
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0093342_0093493	oh that's yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0204584_0204934	radio button
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0026774_0026982	so we probably won't have to worry about that
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0177559_0178451	um yeah maybe you wanna do um left handed um yeah one left click um highlights the the result in whatever you've got open
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0192623_0192899	and then we'll either you know multi select or yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0092082_0092228	oh
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0078195_0078339	but i think it's pretty much complete down
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0127793_0127917	are we looking for volunteers
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0106575_0107074	that still can't make it wrong t. and t. from
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0203798_0204134	in fact you can just leave everything as it is and just remove the check boxes
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0123676_0123949	we'll probably just have a regular two day meeting with him
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0087192_0087460	we have the big yellow and maybe
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0024032_0024162	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0068442_0068558	but
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0168622_0169192	before i have to pass six i will make that file readable writable everything
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0075772_0076025	so you have to be original about your material
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0182924_0183290	in a very accurate way because it has to find the topic first
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0023001_0023214	so
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0161530_0161870	do we know d did you ever say how long it was supposed to be
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0180825_0181051	so if it's like the topik window or the whatever
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0026377_0026667	but what d actually do you know how much we have
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0173517_0173764	then as these come up it'll just pop 'em in there
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0094912_0095078	yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0002312_0002562	oh it doesn't stick at all
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0085720_0085881	yeah right
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0163174_0163343	well we have a bit of time to do the writing on
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0216169_0216280	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0209060_0209246	oh no
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0120918_0121032	but
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0064404_0064962	and then the top five in that menu in globalized top five this meeting and then the rest is obviously in it
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0206901_0207310	se are we bothering with our topic stuff still
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0040589_0040879	were you using like a guido builder or just all from code
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0128207_0129005	um i think if we if we don't get anything from him then we should just do our pens basically
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0100254_0100425	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0019495_0019601	seems unlikely
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0042884_0043116	it runs it much faster than any i do it here
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0012734_0013051	um have you changed the the file yet
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0022869_0023008	yeah that's right yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0203342_0203575	that would be really handy
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0008872_0009062	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0206264_0206444	it didn't think we're gonna bother with that
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0076025_0076404	oh as it not credit it to you
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0035682_0036229	is there any any comments you have about just like weirding and or some sort of minor things
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0100612_0100744	need a lot of audio
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0135493_0135700	how can you get a range of people if you have three
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0133914_0134088	oh no no no no no not forget it
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0154289_0154502	oh
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0086228_0086606	yeah what do you suggest
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0110161_0110304	yeah okay good
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0080690_0080798	yeah that's what i was doing
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0133165_0133775	that would be a good yeah i think that no that's that's a lot
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0131225_0131608	yeah that's true
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0202569_0202681	oh
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0199496_0199655	you have to start again
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0120594_0120764	because the i. l. c. is primary
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0044535_0044929	yeah really stupid of you
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0021208_0021506	uh i saw that and i'm just trying to remember if i did create it
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0033434_0033643	it's a good thing
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0018698_0018894	yeah yeah exactly yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0114594_0114697	oh that's friday
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0143247_0143567	so that gives us two days to do the uh evaluation
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0112218_0112577	well it's still i guess research performance
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0017326_0017558	oh yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0147902_0148058	exactly it's funny
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0013999_0014535	now when yeah when you said at the beginning i thought i must check the remote and then i never did
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0101720_0101945	you know that that was my main point we do have to use metal
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0080057_0080603	mayb maybe have an l. c. d. display something like that like a mobile and with menus
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0024789_0025060	and not gonna ask you to guess i'm gonna tell you that that's supposed to be a tiger
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0088518_0089370	yeah i don't i don't know how uh for twenty five or twelve euros fifty how much of a excellent screen you could get
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0067829_0068347	mean i've got we got um we had three videos
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0104776_0104904	think so yeah
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0072768_0073605	so i don't think i could go any further with it than that so as it's got to be something usable by someone like me as well
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0059098_0059592	uh i think so i think so i'd be able to um pull it up or i could put it in the shared folder or something
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0052492_0052624	are they
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0058638_0058798	okay that's expensive
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0083927_0084464	that's gonna be a problem anyway with the older generation perhaps and that's another issue how we tackle that
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0095602_0095807	yes no that's important
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0077073_0077283	things like that inside it
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0103865_0104156	okay so let's break it up there
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0031914_0032186	okay i see it as one thing it's very supportive
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0050176_0050322	oh you can alright okay
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0093518_0094012	the other thing is just ta tapping into mobile phone design features again
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0077978_0078326	actually that just raises a point i wonder for our design people think
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0058512_0058638	seventeen
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0048126_0048468	uh dear it doesn't look wha like what i want it to be
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0025989_0026225	and independent
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0011762_0012154	now we're developing our remote control which you probably already know
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0045400_0045694	who hope that clicks in i'll just i'll hold it on okay
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0060321_0060809	so it's gonna be yeah we had to buy one
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0081365_0081509	what about green and gold ads
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0078326_0078704	but you know on a mobile phone you can press a key and it gives you a menu
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0065341_0065540	back target group
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0057676_0057871	one point four something like that
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0089871_0090564	is it possible that that for the older generation you could have like an extra button that you press for a large print like you do in large print books
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0102232_0102399	it would be but probably
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0082812_0083151	it don't think they tape things i don't think they use
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0004975_0005318	so this is gonna fall off that doesn't let you put it down
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0081235_0081365	what about the older generation
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0061913_0062426	half of the selling price is taken up by building it
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0027231_0027542	now who would like to go next
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0082379_0082797	can he programme his remote control or is it basic with that too
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0058837_0058954	should we be making notes of this
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0032413_0032773	it's your best friend in your you can talk to a dog it can be a bad friend
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0061754_0061959	okay pretty huge margin
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0066222_0066970	um making that key point just that it's going to be in an international market like a stereo microphone things like that
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0101370_0101720	but th yeah even it doesn't have to be that
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0054715_0054953	but that in trapped
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0029068_0029332	thank you
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0008048_0008190	okay
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0049778_0049996	that's my dreadful that's the worst yeah
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0045797_0046057	oops oh dear what happened there
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0081615_0082363	um my granddad can answer his mobile phone but he couldn't even dream of texting or something like that
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0057511_0057766	it's the out mm yeah
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0098549_0098880	yeah
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0029332_0029602	uh maybe you can get what i'm trying to make
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0085279_0086194	 menus on sort of neu phones now they're still have all these uh pitches and stuff which makes it fairly obvious what you're trying to do
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0095091_0095738	it might it might save up p bit of space is it instead of looking bulky it might look small
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0009196_0009474	okay this is our agenda um
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0086430_0087174	it don't oh i d i don't like the you know the new phones that i kind of got a windows based running system
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0044523_0044668	oh
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0058385_0058512	th fifteen
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0080380_0080592	with menus yeah yeah
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0044795_0045085	oops this is now coming apart let me just put the top in
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0002515_0002683	do we got both of these clipped on
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0097068_0097179	then well i
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0070861_0071104	okay you don't integrate everything into one like
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0104642_0104829	do we go back to our room
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0057871_0058150	one point four euro would make a pound on something like that
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0035911_0036174	oh alright okay
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0090564_0091178	obviously it displays less on the screen it displays less on the screen but as long as they can read it that's the main thing
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0049740_0049998	okay some sort of bad
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0098880_0099666	just just uh quick thing about the um about what you're saying about the it doesn't doesn't need to be fashionable
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0032773_0033136	it doesn't discriminate between you based on what you are
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0036433_0036784	does it look like a dog actually
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0104313_0104416	so see you in half an hour
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0094848_0095316	uh think that's a cost thing i don't i don't know how much we're gonna know about
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0102689_0103258	they're kind of moulded and look a bit different and the telly watch remote controls are solar plastic
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0031569_0031739	he's sitting down
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0028757_0028966	that's the email one
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0018883_0019207	okay i'll leave space for everyone else
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0036174_0036765	well since you guys have been the ones i wanted to do i have to have to get something of it random
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0071292_0071717	my experience is only been been given the remote control with the object i buy
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0028908_0029068	oh yep
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0002237_0002381	am i supposed to be standing up there
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0010193_0010814	um then we'll go do two team training talk about the project plan
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0090577_0090750	teletext is got that option as well
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0102210_0102441	yeah yeah yeah
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0046109_0046216	technical help
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0079446_0080057	alright i was thinking on the same lines you instead of having too many b buttons and make it complicated for the user
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0054142_0054715	and uh birds of prey aren't they oh dear interrupted
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0048877_0049141	it's not a microphone back unnecessarily
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0075081_0075529	and symbols that you don't necessarily understand symbols you're meant to understand that you don't
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0085098_0085279	why everything's doing 'cause i mean
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0094353_0094756	your screen is you can have a bigger screen in the the flip over
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0102504_0102689	mean the sky remote controls and everything
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0072244_0072768	but basically on off volume up and down channel one two that basic functions
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0068347_0069167	uh a t. v. and a sort of amp thing all set up so we got one of the universal remote controls
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0073498_0073730	yeah the main that's the main stuff anyway
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0014958_0015940	um what needs need to be fulfilled by the product um what effects the product has to have and how it's actually going to do that
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0084373_0084958	yeah well it just needs to be as long as it's sort of self intensive and you can you can work out
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0009568_0010193	we will do some stuff get to know each other a bit better feel more comfortable with each other
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0060809_0061392	so i suppose later it depends if we want to undo the price we d or are it going to make our product look a cheapy cheapy option
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0037384_0037686	well as you can see the quality of the work today is um
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0070270_0070483	but that was quite good the fact that you could
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0075486_0075592	um
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0028514_0028661	what does this come from
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0095678_0095860	yeah it's smaller
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0052028_0052492	independent in dependent right did you say they're good at gold
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0033136_0034096	second it's colour and third thing it's got intervention means
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0065357_0066222	so yes yes i don't think we have to i don't think it's a case of worrying about different languages and things like that
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0082252_0082379	oh-huh
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0002986_0003229	yeah i got
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0006420_0006633	yeah
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0014283_0014958	okay um first is the functional design um this is where we all go off and do our individual work
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0082937_0083405	yeah my granddad said that actually better than me using teletext so
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0036460_0036601	okay
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0046538_0046851	hopefully that'll stay on two handed version
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0046851_0047088	okay uh
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0089370_0089931	you'd you'd have to sort of keep it down to a black and white l. c. d. thing anyway i still see
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0037143_0037529	and also my drawing skill isn't that great so yeah
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0001887_0002029	okay that's fine
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0058488_0058597	seventeen pounds
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0043874_0044199	yeah that's better than i think
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0060813_0060929	think
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0056546_0057464	um finance wise we've got a selling price at twenty five euros which i don't actually know what that is in pounds at all
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0001099_0001453	are we we're not yet in the lights so people can see that a bit better
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0078704_0079448	it's got a menu display a one for incorporating that into the design of a remote control might be useful so you've got a little l. c. d. display
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0043248_0043437	uh strong
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0018410_0018612	so
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0071188_0071292	yeah
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0048966_0049134	okay yeah
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0056312_0056546	that was fun right
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0047441_0047935	again this is off the top of my head i was gonna do a big cat too um
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0010814_0011589	to discuss our own ideas and everything um and we've got twenty five minutes to do that as far as i can understand
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0062426_0062944	um and profit aim is fifty million euros which is a
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0012154_0012699	um we want it to be original something that's s people haven't thought of
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0003130_0003339	alright both of them okay
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0035348_0035555	yeah okay
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0035651_0036214	please please leave me a space at the bottom i'm little you can get to the top we s standing on a chair
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0061351_0061782	yeah um production costs at twelve fifty so
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0069167_0069939	um that you programme each of your things into but that kept losing the signals so we'd have to re programme it every now and again
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0052413_0052596	ego
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0064823_0065111	any particular thing is everyone user friendly to everyone
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0008382_0009196	um i'm sorry the project manager and this is our first meeting specially in a half
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0024322_0024433	are we running out of play
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0050119_0050466	it's not a seagull right not a seagull
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0015940_0016094	um conceptual design
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0070596_0070891	it didn't have six remote controls sitting in front of you
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0017038_0017203	okay right
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0084120_0084324	yeah the age gap
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0042812_0043022	uh squarey
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0069939_0070270	uh think it was quite a cheapy as well so that might have had some to do with that
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0051987_0052095	let it go
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0071124_0071332	yeah 'cause you
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0100524_0101484	so i think think the whole design thing might be quite p i mean you don't you you can still have plastic and it look quite good but
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0098120_0098951	and think that's probably about it and then we'll come back and erase again and i'll get to do another fantastic powerpoint presentation
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0052430_0052863	yeah you know yeah an egg
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0081521_0081896	you mean to say with less than a quarter
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0052691_0052920	oh right okay i'm not good at it gold
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0071717_0072244	now doing any tapping on it and programming using it to programme t. v. remote uh videos and things
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0043985_0044177	okay let's say
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0044014_0044212	okay
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0037680_0037894	think it's not standing good
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0063129_0063642	yeah b yes w um yeah i presume so
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0059419_0060321	havei having said that they if you wanna get one of those the the ones on the market at the moment let's they're about twenty pounds anyway
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0002912_0003048	just gonna answer me or not
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0045045_0045174	woah
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0035001_0035109	okay thank you
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0095969_0096635	and there's no reason we need to make it look as fashionable and stylish as a mobile phone it can still be light weighted plastic you know
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0064913_0065029	now yeah
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0044316_0044795	um i'm very impressed with your artistic skills my friends are dreadful
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0101945_0102210	so i don't have enough use in plastic it does make it cheaper i propose it would
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0049290_0049778	uh and somewhere there's a body behind
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0077283_0077979	because it doesn't make when you pick it up it doesn't make it really complicated to look at it's obvious what you're doing um
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0047671_0047779	oh
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0008050_0008166	it's a two two
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0092964_0093488	obvious symbols and that's where you control recording and things like that
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0099666_0100524	the so i i had a quick look at the company website and it's like the the uh we put the fashion into electronics
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0055366_0055677	there we go hope that pen's gonna be okay
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0051612_0051866	that don't um
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0095738_0095924	but it might have its costs implications
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0087683_0088287	uh i d i've not got a new one but um my friend got a new one and i'm just trying to do things with it and i just kept getting lost
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0067520_0067829	what are your experiences with remote controls
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0103258_0103865	which looks a bit smaller so yeah i guess that's tough we can think about
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0083464_0083927	so that's the problem regarding of any design modifications you you come up with
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0012699_0013201	it's not out in the shops um trendy appealing to a wide market
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0031347_0031914	it's actually sitting so it's sitting it's not standing
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0058085_0058757	yeah yeah so that yeah about seventy t seventy pounds sorry about that
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0080603_0081203	and if it's somewhat similar to what you have on mobile phone people might find it easier to browse and navigate also maybe
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0086443_0086588	but i don't know how
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0058954_0059174	we can just refer to this later can't we
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0082135_0082252	yeah
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0025453_0025724	and i see them as mythic
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0039041_0039795	yeah it can be a corporate it can be a corporate uh
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0070518_0070672	you call the ones that send time
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0051149_0051612	suppose they're all so independent i'd put that one down again
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0039631_0039980	it's gonna be a p it's gonna be a part
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0008190_0008382	hello everybody
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0049996_0050809	that's it's meant to be an email you can tell it's a flying animal could have been a seagle i never thought of a seagull
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0096635_0096916	something that is easily moulded and produced
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0087295_0087683	it find it really confusing i kept getting lost in the f
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0100916_0101130	so but yeah
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0042120_0042597	yeah and uh i'll have to think on the spot of uh things that it is
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0052920_0053660	let's think they're quite featured flying around everywhere doing their own thing
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0016231_0016780	what we're thinking how it's gonna go and then the detailed design how we're actually gonna put it into importance is make it work
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0094012_0094353	you could have a flip top remote control so that when you flip over the top
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0050809_0051149	and the um again i'm thinking on my feet goodness
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0096916_0097245	so i'm treating on your t. v. guys
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0097097_0097935	um right okay we've got half an hour before the next meeting so we're gonna go off and do our individual things
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0000037_0000176	oh okay
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0039795_0040627	well it was it was an at first uh firstly it was an attempt at a t. regex and then it sort of change into a polynomial but it can be a circuit now uh
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0027731_0027975	it's a bit
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0037960_0038448	okay now i'm gonna have to change what it was originally gonna be because that looks like a beer now so
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0075518_0075806	it's simplicity of symbols you could think of
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0091369_0091737	or what about kind of a dual function i
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0217196_0218132	so no teletext only for t. v. and by implication video a corporate image should be incorporated in their remote control um something about video playback
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0123492_0123679	yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0193952_0194291	yes which uh is cheap in the long run as well
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0065404_0066192	although than having a lot of complex buttons because you can have an engineering division maybe having hundred buttons and maybe having uh a remote control which has the main features
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0182540_0182649	the paragraph yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0061620_0062515	actually m some of my points might overlap with what volumes just mention but basically my second was like uh what better brainstorming we did in the last meeting
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0083436_0083550	yeah i think you can pull it out now
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0086670_0087219	male and female all age groups from fifteen up are and um we observed them in the lab
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0012023_0012947	um our budget would have to affect um try not to reflect our budget um that we might
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0088814_0089076	so it has obvious design implications there
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0148224_0148581	uh i don't think just moving your finger around in a small screen is going to deal with that anymore
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0124766_0125253	um so we want logo we want um
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0129154_0129967	it's the user interface design that may and that the sort of you know fashionable aspect of it we might have to change for different markets around the world
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0143060_0143427	the industries maybe your touch screen could be a better option for that
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0008127_0008353	okay um
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0216498_0216776	right i think we have to round up um
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0221657_0222602	it yes it could be a adapt adapt variant feature um rather than a design feature you know draw an attention to that
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0053624_0053899	it can't be okay that's okay with me
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0066741_0067462	but we had to make it uh unique so that people want to buy it will p punish these two uh features together
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0060255_0060416	oh that's not right
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0215628_0216163	sixti designs and then choose which uh which uh appeals the most like that could be the most common design
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0206780_0206923	and i look at the mobile
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0051225_0051707	uh th that was just sort of a general point there
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0146158_0146540	or they can make it bigger or they can change the features slightly um
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0045351_0045881	which obviously means that we're gonna have to perform to whatever uh
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0232530_0232698	because we're at lunchtime now i think
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0153020_0153426	the younger age group initially and then broadened out the market later
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0147756_0148224	um i'm concerned when you reach the the r. s. i. issue you've again repetitive strain injury
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0123366_0123469	that's a super idea
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0191820_0192107	yeah it could be on that yeah okay
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0184190_0184550	now for such simple functions because we're focussing on that yes okay
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0154040_0154364	if say people between age group of forty to thirty five are the biggest market
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0137001_0137251	yes it will appeal to sections of the market that
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0103167_0103614	if it's any more information i can email you extra details is that okay
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0206728_0206856	we could look into that but
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0078855_0079091	oh it's vibrating it's strange
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0097607_0098356	um um slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for uh a repetitive strain injury
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0017791_0017931	can i grab the
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0114818_0115453	so on and i think it's sort of general knowledge that people do find programming their videos and i'm
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0200218_0200588	so it's like uh you can say a banana shape kind of thing covered up like a boot
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0019400_0019512	um f. and
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0230012_0230375	it think you might get rid of it but um
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0044440_0045351	when you when you pressed anything it would the chip would convert it into some form of our data which could be decoded by the t. v. receiver
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0158124_0158361	business kind of class type people
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0143394_0143531	yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0207989_0208367	although then you're not trying to make it like a c. shell or what you ta telling like
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0024903_0025738	um so i decided i'd have a look at what other people have designed and try to take some inspiration from that
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0186123_0186346	um what other functions
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0090332_0091220	but um that's quite a high profit of our our you know international target group our appear to spend more money for something that's bit nice a looking
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0192773_0192946	rechargeable with the docking station
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0142436_0143060	yeah oh maybe it's too as uh it it was integrated the uh risk uh of for repetitive use
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0123800_0124766	um the third thing was that we have to make sure the corporate image is very much incorporated into the hand set
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0189772_0190169	you sit it in its charger when you're not using it or at night or something
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0220670_0221444	it's gonna takes the place of having a button to press for the date and having the button to press for the channel things like that
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0226198_0226844	and we've talked about um there being an alarm or something a beeping for being lost um
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0013633_0014340	um distinction between what our budget was and what we wanted it to look like
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0008031_0008152	uh no that's okay sorry
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0207410_0207989	other than like c. cells logo could become means you could put a logo in the corner of uh the model
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0080544_0080661	you can't
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0059104_0059321	but it will kick in
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0112627_0113386	anything about that on the market research or something like regarding whether people want a combination something like that
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0077302_0077469	uh any comments like if you want
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0128591_0128772	it's it's gonna be very round the world
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0060673_0060814	it's connecting uh this
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0191928_0192056	yeah on that as well so
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0018212_0018341	thanks
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0106034_0106148	um
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0206040_0206644	um obviously into the design while also making it quite different from anything else that's there
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0121865_0122367	used to find it needs to be something that you don't lose so you're saying whispering
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0219067_0219618	making it simpler so instead of having lots of things you put in for date
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0229731_0230004	or shall i just uh suddenly look at all the issues involved
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0101820_0102050	the thirty five is an answer we would like those two features
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0172808_0173473	but just discussing the different age groups and targeting the different age groups it appears to me we already produce our own mobile phones
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0036880_0037334	uh as i said about the which batteries we were gonna choose
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0127142_0127782	it's gonna be different for a fifteen euro and for somebody who's sixty and also across the world if we're aiming at the international market
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0184469_0185430	but we should focus on making the manual is user friendly as possible because a lot of them are just tiny little writing in lots and lots of pages
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0116582_0117240	in fact i just called up that table there we asked those two questions the table relates to both questions so we didn't differentiate
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0188854_0189772	well they la they they last quite a long time and if you had uh when you th the thing that you get with um mobile phones
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0148581_0148982	think that is still a kind of question mark issue how we deal with that
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0019224_0019332	oh f. eight
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0232414_0232555	yes right
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0047240_0047388	and then finally
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0176511_0176914	that's that's a fri as three aspect of our service would that not make it more attractive to them
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0180251_0180354	oh yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0113429_0114281	um we didn't really look into that but remember we found that finding that most people only use about uh ten percent of the buttons
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0077551_0077886	um i think we'll chat about it at the end
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0019684_0019789	oh right yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0180470_0180828	if it was something as simple as you couldn't change the channel
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0173473_0174307	that that's kind of what led us on to comparing t. v. remote controls with with our design features um change companies like car phone wirehouse
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0091790_0092588	for example you can see below there seventy five percent of users zap a lot so you've got your person stuck back in the sofa channel hopping
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0208703_0209017	uh i think that's that sounds a really attractive idea
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0151286_0151974	or speech recognition which is extreme I think that's the only way that you can avoid
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0166423_0166641	you've already got the numbers for typing in anyway
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0111510_0112232	you can record straight off the t. v. anyway so on to on to like the t. v. hard drive or something
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0174307_0174740	you can pop in any time of a phone that you've bought for them if you've got any problems with it and they'll fix it
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0023844_0024692	everything is just um some sort of signal to change the state of the t. t. v. or other appliances that it's sending the signal too
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0190169_0190674	but it doesn't really matter 'cause it never really runs out 'cause it lasts a long time once it is charged
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0203150_0204079	um things that are associated with the company in view to try and incorporate that into the design of the product
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0051594_0051715	yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0132750_0133469	rubber buttons not tiny little on big rubber buttons but what about i mean 'cause we got to make it original
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0107683_0108058	so could we not programme our video with this remote control
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0130021_0130539	so are we talking of a single m model or maybe five six designs and another that
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0106856_0107844	which limits you know all of the different things that it limits the cost for us but also makes it easier to understand for the consumer
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0134432_0135394	um so you it's like a little panel that you touch rather than a button which shouldn't wear out as much either not sure about the
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0085725_0086149	um so that's where we started we used our our usability lab
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0233342_0233739	and i think you can email me if there's any more questions
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0095591_0096272	it's the slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing uh fifty percent were were specifically frustrated by that
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0199279_0199946	that's very strange because your thumb is lightly up so they come up with something like this covered up so here
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0165894_0166237	and you wouldn't you wouldn't need a a whole host of extra buttons for that
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0125931_0126371	um people paying more for it to look good
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0036119_0036880	now the main components i came up with um were obviously the power source for the batteries 'cause otherwise it's not gonna work
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0169347_0169912	it's been been around for a long time it's just it's not very well advised as to how to use 'em and things
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0221444_0221589	um it could be i c
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0112245_0112700	uh think we assume that it's still got play and start functions in prog programming
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0003704_0003883	oh right okay
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0190909_0191734	yeah and if yeah if you if you had if you had one of those uh just coming back to your other point about pressing the button and saying off the beep in the room that could uh
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0225709_0225935	that's not at the moment a requirement it's something we're looking at
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0061180_0061367	it is it's on okay
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0010062_0010181	equiptment
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0051707_0051903	and that's a s yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0219960_0220091	so that they will look at the guide and
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0126492_0126781	um we need to focus on that as well
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0089695_0090332	easy to spend more money when a remote control would look fancy we were quite surprised by that finding
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0027266_0027489	um dealing with the inside really
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0222671_0223557	and also paid um lip service in the instruction manual 'cause it's very simple so putting it down in words should be helpful
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0197718_0197875	okay so we've got a flip screen
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0196261_0196662	and we don't w i mean so many remote controls look absolutely identical these long
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0213830_0213973	less chance of it being lost too
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0209017_0209569	of not come across anything like that before if it kind of yeah and that opens out into your flip top
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0193074_0193261	so the re charge would be you be your
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0169104_0169455	um and it has been around for quite a long time
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0175078_0175985	is it worth while with with our retail outlets having a a similar um kind of service so that if older users were deterred from buying this
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0154752_0155002	we are we're talking about um
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0097238_0097521	they just can't be bothered to learn about the other functions
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0087219_0087626	just their general use of the remote control you could be able to have a hundred subjects there
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0081185_0081594	uh whoops
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0081740_0082067	that more oh dear
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0043307_0044180	we've just got the the power going to the infrared bulb the chip and the uh u. i. interface um
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0209833_0210338	nice to hold in the palm of the hand and just because you're having to actually insert in between the two covers
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0052766_0053017	okay thank you very much
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0205260_0205875	or something um something along those lines to be able to incorporate it quite
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0216283_0216461	what we can like think of vice designs
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0146528_0146951	the internal d engineering design is got to remain the same yes absolutely
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0232273_0232423	questionnaire for
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0174740_0175078	the form the company you can use their telephones
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0083679_0083990	thank you let's pull it close a little bit
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0080959_0081103	but just do the best we can
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0004768_0004918	come on
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0134069_0134462	yeah yeah that's what i was just yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0009263_0009912	we decided upon a universal control one hand set for all t. v. video
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0101496_0101820	um that trend reverses in the older age groups
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0076762_0076903	so in overall simple and uh
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0022885_0023358	well a device which basically just sends the signal to the t. v. it changes its state
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0175985_0176511	if they know they can just pop into one of our high street outlets uh you know which button is it i press for this
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0117928_0118404	so you can see how the the excess no sort of variance across the age group there
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0180125_0180592	taking your t. v. and your control and saying look this is what i'm doing it's not working what should i do
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0080309_0080569	oh i got to keep this here
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0220232_0220665	or is is this nothing to do with the project requirements is this just that's an add on feature
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0008593_0008870	uh i'll go over what we decided last meeting
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0233929_0234196	um and i'll be able to not answer them
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0153426_0153757	do we really have to go for everyone right away
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0159538_0159772	you know focus on where the idea will be taken up
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0195498_0196249	because then you have got the repetitive strain injury in your body how many how much you try to make it simple um
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0110866_0111006	oh yes
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0199151_0199252	yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0199946_0200218	and you don't have to you know begin your thumb too much
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0172320_0172808	can i just run this past you while it appears to me i don't mean to quickly jump from one subject to another
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0033769_0034754	yeah that the well you ca you can't get the sort of circular round ones but i'm just wondering about the power consumption and how much you need to send the data record
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0080345_0080468	it think you have to
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0123385_0123711	something like that but that's that sounds a lot cheaper to me
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0110905_0111510	if you yeah and if you've got if you've got a s sky box uh one of these sky boxes now
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0084009_0084398	you should be able to make it over to your thing now yeah they can
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0163884_0164486	because you've got your general record anyway so if you there's a programme on you want to put record on
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0029482_0029852	wireless and you don't need to send very much information
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0048772_0049534	um it should should be different enough um from the alternative products to get a good consumer base
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0196662_0197058	round things with the same coloured buttons all crammed in on the s the surface
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0059548_0059679	function f. eight yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0109550_0109781	it just said for t. v. only
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0183125_0183634	just no extra d the person has to walk to a shop on the high street um
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0073649_0074378	yeah with that i think we'll be able to achieve volumes of scale also so we can give in add in more features and make it less costly
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0128772_0129154	at the end of the day the the engineering design is one thing
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0207096_0207273	what we are talking is to make it more
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0042276_0042828	two it's not a proper circuit i'm not sure if it work or not
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0064255_0064919	so purpose as volume already said i would put it to simplify the interaction with t. v. to make it as simple as possible
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0103869_0104058	right um
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0166237_0166555	you just need what 'cause you've already got the numbers there anyway yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0080875_0081185	have to i'll have to move it won't i
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0118404_0118899	uh a supplement number of don't know s in the older age group i think that's just just general fear of new technology
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0223519_0223739	um and the rechargeable batteries
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0143672_0144196	so a big b okay so you you're designing designs besides not only segment edges
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0081594_0081740	and it manages
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0016119_0016324	okay
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0063691_0064255	um i haven't had some marketing data and basically every product is market demand
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0135290_0135625	nee well no 'cause you wouldn't have to you don't have to press them you just
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0077886_0078435	okay so if anyone wants to write something down they want to bring up at the end um
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0074762_0075212	that's so this is if you ask me personally i would make a
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0072814_0073649	as we saw we we have to make a profit also so we we can maybe go for an economy is uh of a high production by fifty million budget
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0212165_0212769	or you could do um different like you get with mobile phones different fascas
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0051715_0052358	that's a very important point it came up in our market research findings too so i can refer to that whenever you'd like me to present
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0230717_0230976	instruction manuals 'cause they tend to be a
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0159772_0160276	first is most likely to be taken up first of all where the main purpose is coming from for our product like this
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0229266_0229414	yeah i think that's us
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0164486_0164979	that's fine but if you do want to tape something in two days' time you're not sure if you're going to
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0192253_0192616	so are we talking about a concept of a rechargeable something under the remote
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0096272_0097238	uh thirty four percent of people take said they take too much time to learn to use and i think that ties in with the um the previous finding of people only using ten percent of the buttons
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0136652_0136766	yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0201381_0201563	because it's kind of moulded to your hand anyway
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0166569_0167039	yeah i'm i'm not come across that function but it sounds wonderful
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0115453_0115669	so i don't know if that's something we need to look out
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0171461_0171636	excellent mm-hmm
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0127782_0128591	what is um attractive to a trendy user and what is attractive to a retired south african i don't know you get the idea
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0153750_0153940	we could focus on the biggest market
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0182307_0183125	there will be a customer service number thing that you can phone up and speak to and that way there's no call out charge
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0146796_0147715	it's gonna be the same so we need to focus on just one thing not get bogged down in lots of different um possibilities um
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0181366_0181542	that thing so
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0202482_0202746	that wouldn't exactly sum up but yeah smooth
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0223912_0224048	um
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0030249_0030387	now oh one
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0022501_0022885	what the first thing question i asked was what are we trying to design
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0132038_0132750	what about you were talking about the buttons um the controls that you're coming out now have kind of big
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0198846_0199279	basically we have a flat one it it looks like a box like a jacket
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0169712_0170288	now it's not um but i think if a seriousness was kind of brought to the forefront about that
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0215162_0215553	that's easy to put nice to handle
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0007420_0007886	um right our agenda for today do you want us to give you a second
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0109419_0109550	uh i don't know what you think
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0229455_0229731	what would specifically like marketing to look out for the next meeting
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0157418_0157983	but i don't think we're focusing on that i think we are focussing on a sort of mid range um
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0198282_0198846	what i was thinking of a design which nokia uh c came up with almost six or seven years back
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0194291_0194770	um the c the shape you got trendy
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0179443_0180041	the functionality of it in the sense that you're sitting there you're pressing this button in your t. v. is not doing it
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0210880_0211441	think it's a really nice idea and pasc you can get you know even though we're using plastic
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0197058_0197764	we definitely an o an obvious thing a very simple thing is to get away from these brown rectangles we don't want that
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0011216_0012023	we decided it's important to reflect the company's image in our product we put fashion in electronics you know that kind of thing
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0014485_0014869	want it to look unclated unwanted to the customer
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0114281_0114818	i think that that those did tend to be the basic channel hopping things and on and off for the video fast forwarding
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0208341_0208598	well we need to think about how it is gonna look different
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0158340_0158878	and just thinking of budgetary estimates two for when it does get to the sort of broad scale marketing stage
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0193338_0193963	yeah yeah that yeah that that that would be fine and also that would mean they wouldn't have to go out buying batteries all the time
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0091220_0091790	um current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user over all
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0176922_0177063	yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0165402_0165877	it's not channel it's not when it finishes it's not anything like that it's just a number
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0200744_0201169	so so what happens is you don't have to press your thumb too long like
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0148982_0149485	um r. s. i. tends to be costed by repetitive small movements
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0186957_0187714	but we should think about c 'cause you've got the delimiter between oh batteries that's what i was thinking about
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0185430_0185816	it does you just put it in your drawer until something goes wrong and then you try and search through it
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0120074_0120646	we do have a budget limitation that we can't control ourselves
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0224964_0225675	we've got the buttons but i think we'll work through that with the design of it um
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0102724_0103167	so i had multiple tables and things that i could show you but i think i'll just keep it simple
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0092588_0092783	so again that power implications there
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0187956_0188561	um they're they're specially made for the uh for the mobile phones
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0181827_0181972	instruction manual
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0218236_0219067	that was um in cutting down the number that was kind of sample that was cutting down the number of functions
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0031970_0032302	could i uh can i interrupt to ask a question there is that appropriate
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0180828_0181323	but i mean for if there are any more or uh we absolutely definite it's only gonna be for t. v. and video
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0061477_0061620	yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0151052_0151322	oh no and it becomes ridiculous yes i know
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0094690_0095591	the biggest frustrations that people found with the order to personal preferences were um something that you p you mentioned earlier uh remote controls are often lost in the room
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0219412_0219960	uh so when they press for programming you c it comes up on the l. c. d. remote indicator about using video plus
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0082660_0082831	okay i've got it a bit more for the 'kay
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0100548_0101364	but which i'm thinking of now is um even if perhaps the lost control can give off a beep every now and again until you find it or are flashing light
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0029852_0030249	um most of them are paid by some form of battery
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0209569_0209833	then it's nice t to ho you can make it light weight plastic
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0225935_0226310	what p preference so we make a round to market research at some point to see what people would like
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0035461_0036032	um now the ones at the moment are small but i'm just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0211441_0212121	you can still i think of the design you can get in plastic we can create a nice console shell or zap shell exterior
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0042828_0043307	oh i'm not even comfortable that it's the real um the real way you'd wire it up but anyway
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0227308_0228085	but there aren't gonna be that func that that many functions incorporated into it so it should be fine and the ad the instruction manual
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0228085_0228384	and don't know if we deal with that um
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0098896_0099689	um the fast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like um a liquid crystal display and speech recognition
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0200379_0200552	luckily curved curved
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0122886_0123385	you go on press the button on top of the t. v. and it beeps and you like okay it's over there
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0109768_0109931	would that imply video use
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0032617_0033253	uh if you if you look at if you look at most remote controls they're quite they're quite chunky and that's because of the size of the batteries
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0053017_0053235	um would you like to continue on from that
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0100431_0100548	something we didn't put to them
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0093454_0094252	um and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we don't have so many functions actually on the remote control
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0164979_0165402	you put the number in and it's just a number it's not a date it's not time
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0185840_0186028	so okay
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0044335_0044440	which would basically
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0183396_0183560	okay
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0081300_0081424	you'll have to push it a bit more
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0144633_0145286	maybe for us and you can have a slightly bigger remote control and maybe in japan and you m need to have a small yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0064919_0065298	and to summarise i i would say it's it should be user friendly by being easy to use
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0163198_0163315	yeah yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0122367_0122886	maybe on the t. v. you could put like a pack on the t. v. or something so you can't see the remote
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0049534_0049953	we were talking about it before and also just something that i was thinking about
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0151424_0151723	yeah speech recognition but yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0098356_0098896	you know those small movements of the remote control can lead to kind of shooter and echo problems
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0109929_0110099	two yeah yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0106240_0106856	our control is only going to be for t. v. it's not going to be uh combined control
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0017650_0017791	okay yeah i'll go fast
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0171608_0171863	so that yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0000818_0000982	that's up there
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0231160_0231851	democrised thing um there every ones got like a big pile of them but no one really uses them
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0185816_0186123	so that should be something we think about
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0201249_0201901	so it's already covered up so your thumb doesn't uh yeah so we can have a s like you know loaded according to your
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0117240_0117928	would you prefer an l. c. d. screen that's multi function remote and would you pay more for speech recognition in a remote control
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0041918_0042276	and so this is what i had as the basic idea of what we wanna do
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0201997_0202359	the way you h hold of it's kind of symmetrical in the bottom something like that
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0154022_0154151	okay i
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0125490_0125856	feasible trendy i mean what you were talking about with the marketing
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0138337_0138495	oh
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0228984_0229266	yeah and different from what's out there
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0225575_0225709	um
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0215455_0215628	yeah maybe we could come up with some sev five
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0166940_0167575	it is after um if you look in the newspaper a t. v. guide or any t. v. guide there's a five
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0023358_0023844	whether that be the power or the channel um or the volume
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0102050_0102645	that kind of evens out thirty five to forty five and in the older age group that kind of reverses they're not so bothered with this
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0221346_0221738	right so it's kind of doing away with the programming feature
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0017503_0017732	now that's fine that's fine
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0206981_0207096	um
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0138496_0138917	but also uh ergonomics as we're saying of the different designs
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0025738_0026006	but uh although we will want to be taking
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0118844_0119020	yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0040149_0040724	which not most people do so as we're applying to the most audience that should be fine
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0226542_0226773	for decision right
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0019596_0019726	production effect eight
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0092792_0093454	um fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons so again a big design issue there
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0178286_0178408	oh
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0033253_0033769	they have to be obviously this certain size to fit those batteries in
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0117659_0117763	oh right okay
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0087633_0088097	our findings lots of findings i've just summarised some of them here
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0205116_0205242	oh no
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0170208_0170330	yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0053591_0053854	or maybe it's the laptop over
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0212769_0213100	you could have different kind of cases
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0232559_0232680	think it's time for us to
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0109781_0110213	but i mean general t. v. controls do do video as well
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0160471_0160942	okay so the remote control functions
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0229030_0229156	yeah i think
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0185334_0185586	just people of reading them so they just do the obvious yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0213100_0213867	so you could have like cycle ones for younger people and sleek ones and
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0104172_0104485	we have new project requirements um
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0165687_0165894	and he w yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0130630_0131204	well you could you could you could have a number of different designs i mean inside that'd be essentially exactly the same
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0066315_0066622	like volume control or channel changing the channel or whatever
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0162240_0162351	video plus
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0158878_0159335	we want to you know not waste money not be profitable and uh
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0210338_0210880	that's gonna take care of some of the repetitive strain injury try to p prevent a lot of it i would think
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0069035_0069351	can we put in the middle part of the flip flip top
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0060486_0060728	the plug hasn't come out at the bottom has it
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0133869_0134201	um you know with the touch screen computers
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0016324_0016680	um three presentations i got right here so
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0211055_0211171	yeah we could look into that
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0086149_0086670	the company's usability lab we did our usual selection methods to get a cross section of the general public
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0149607_0150179	im d i really can't get my head around this one this me have to be spooned to a future meeting but something we should take about
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0188561_0188987	but they come with the charger i mean you could you could bundle it charge your own but
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0194770_0195498	it don't want a big box with lots of things you don't want a tiny sort of little thing either
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0160942_0161612	um we've got the t. v. we've got the video now there is um
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0227005_0227308	learning how to use it should be as simple as possible
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0080727_0080950	you have to this can be put
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0156520_0157418	now with the baby boomers the older generations are actually larger they have a great population than us young people
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0089076_0089559	um we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0103476_0103651	that's fine
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0184229_0184510	and that yeah they should be f yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0171863_0172203	but just have that function would be would be really good
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0216798_0217196	can i just quickly um go over the new project requirements that i haven't missed anything
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0131349_0131665	the features could be same and the body could look slightly different
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0133620_0133736	what about
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0144196_0144633	you're deci uh dividing it according to the contents also the market
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0183560_0184036	think it would be too much of an effort for a person to for a phone maybe he might walk down the street
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0021250_0021849	okay this is uh the working design presented by me the uh industrial designer education
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0059477_0059630	ex function
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0181972_0182307	but i mean there there's customer service
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0137206_0137531	um but quite um
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0039212_0040149	now these have a wireless range up to about five minutes which is sort of suitable for anyone who's watching their t. v. and less they own a cinema
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0105110_0106034	we're not going to be using teletext um apparently consumers consider out dated with the internet now
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0204322_0205260	for example if it was a c. or something like that you could have it in a base c. shape that opens up kind of like a shell
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0186346_0186957	we need i'm not sure if we need a design um decision now
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0164781_0164911	just wake up the numbers
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0154265_0154787	and when we've been throwing up our ideas we're automatically talking about business people young people trendy people
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0181639_0182014	oh mean insta instruction books i feel c i reckon can accommodate that
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0184036_0184327	but for our remote he will just refer to the manual and all that
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0131327_0131716	just yeah yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0187714_0187922	more about phone batteries what kind of battery is that
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0052171_0052865	oh right okay and yeah that's that's what i came up with there so if you wanna
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0223739_0224192	was there anything else there that we in the new p new project requirements
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0126734_0127142	yes first market research will be needed to kind of focus on what that is
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0103460_0103591	okay
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0135518_0135840	you don't have to press it you just have to put your thumb on to it
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0190674_0191003	um something like that should reduce the size of it
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0101364_0101496	possibly
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0033595_0033876	uh a triple a. is the smallest you can get that not right
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0006681_0007420	right okay um this is our second meeting and i might be a bit all over the place
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0027489_0028055	so uh yeah i ran out of time so i couldn't do this one as fun as the last one
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0013141_0013633	have a bit of oh oh you can see it okay
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0088097_0088814	the overall thing which i've i've got at the top there in the electronics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0181323_0181622	uh we're not gonna pay anymore okay just a thought
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0110444_0110888	and then you c well we'll some you get con you get combined t. v. and videos don't you
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0084171_0084387	get it right over okay thank you
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0110365_0110586	uh d well i don't know 'cause uh the if you've c
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0192552_0192970	yeah some sort of docking station or yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0067462_0067737	so what the concept is to have a flip top model
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0202640_0203026	can you look into the company logo
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0155203_0155496	the type of company that we're working for is well
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0021996_0022501	okay this is where i went a bit mad with powerpoint so
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0060745_0061098	nee now yeah it's just going on
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0152211_0152875	do we have to initially um you know looking at the findings here focus on
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0017101_0017584	um is it okay if i propose that too later i just want to get access to a little bit more information is that okay
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0000020_0000483	help me don't stop
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0145256_0146158	and then we have to design one product and then the company can take it wherever they want to d in the sense that they can make it smaller
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0032302_0032675	you're saying the triple a. batteries are small or d other curve the curves surrounding it
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0034754_0035461	um and th which leads so of on to the next point about them being small and easy to carry around
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0016866_0017062	shall we hear from marketing first
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0161750_0162392	uh can't remember what it's called the little code at the end of programme details yes
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0099689_0100431	again that was to aid i think in uh when they lost the actual remote control some kind of speech recognition
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0082370_0082509	where am i
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0127940_0128210	with the l. c. d. you don't have that with the printed circuit board
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0208230_0208684	and just kind of pushing it that to if you come out with anything else but i mean i totally agree
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0179203_0179843	um not sure how long we've got left but we need to make a decision about um
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0141328_0141902	let's just erase another point well it according to me it's kind of applies to both our designers here so i'm not sure how it would fit in
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0080189_0080629	okay can we add in uh an attachment to closing feature
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0154292_0154798	rest other buttons they are in a very discounted and they are not consistent with with the other models you know
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0220136_0220425	for the yeah the whistle
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0065014_0065289	if you're i mean you switch the t. v. and then you put it on the side
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0213084_0213742	and finally the body should be detachable may be ch you can change the body of the case casing the case outside
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0149237_0149677	first thing is uh basically on design we just took the input from the previous meeting
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0165863_0166384	repetition of certain button buttons which i already explain in example volume and channel control buttons
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0086484_0086645	and we threw open to the field yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0012298_0012602	the minutes from last time
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0195004_0195515	on the bottom we're gonna have the rubber the rubber ones the anti r. ones
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0222260_0222540	oh sorry i didn't mention that but we'll be incorporating in the design
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0085412_0085659	the total battery for control of the controls
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0074990_0075189	yeah i think th yeah practically
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0148998_0149237	would like to show something which i did here
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0222656_0223061	because i took it from the feedback you gave in the last meeting from y from your your report
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0129264_0129906	you could have a flat screen inside yeah i'm just wondering whether we want an l. c. d. screen inside
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0169125_0169527	so it could be like where is the remote and the remote answer is i am here
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0164442_0165203	so have the um the volume and the programme and things like that on the lower side
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0005239_0005447	but in that way
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0150290_0150802	second is we just into computers the picture here shows what are the standard models offered by computers here
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0076724_0076992	another question is like sorry
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0175745_0176007	it can't see that's that play and stop and things
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0115672_0115851	yeah yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0163243_0163660	you've got your l. c. d. display there and you've got the buttons there so you're holding in the palm of your hand yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0105188_0105650	but i was thinking more of the buttons because the buttons which they've they've said
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0134989_0135328	absolutely for somebody who serves very often
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0024946_0025060	that's okay
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0226432_0226842	think that was you talked about a beeper for illustration and we just rejected that in favour of a voice recognition then
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0052412_0053316	like the the solar charging 'cause most people have the light on in the room anyway so they could get when when you got t. v.
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0189054_0189228	what you could um
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0176016_0176429	this is a central one the one you yeah volume and channel
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0191274_0191588	um okay so we've got the battery
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0036755_0036949	it don't think so not yet
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0134192_0135048	you could have some sort of stylus that you could pull out but i i think they could get a bit easily lost 'cause i had
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0210871_0211662	the if in a year's time we be you get feedback from the design features that show something else is coming uh it's so easy to just produce that that could be slipped on
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0162868_0163243	you if if we just use the shell as an example again you open that
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0076992_0077461	th which one would last the longest because we don't want customers to be like you're not charging like a mobile phone everyday
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0058725_0059062	but i i think i think the the next ones are the best anyway
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0056054_0056835	uh i don't think it counts electric lights now but i mean not many p you don't want to limit your market
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0218025_0218991	find uh we're talking of voice recognition also because that uh we have not addressed the issue of uh how to locate uh remote control if it's lost
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0191588_0192062	the inside components is pretty standardised across the board isn't it
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0131449_0132237	if the whole thing's gonna be this rubber thing it would be good to open it up and see something quite fancy looking inside
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0189425_0190016	one of the decisions we had to make was whether we had double a. or triple a. 'cause they still got to be charged this way haven't they
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0068504_0069132	could i just ask referring back to solar charging is that compatible with um standard batteries
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0094603_0095211	you could you could s you could put them vertically right next to each other and have a much smaller switch on each one
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0185833_0186520	but i think pretty much we've used cheap relatively cheap and simple things
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0068163_0068323	oh
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0204917_0205635	is that really going to fit fancy look and feel which was the major thing that people wanted market research is that fancy uh
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0192189_0192592	so there's not uh really a decision to be made there um
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0183573_0184148	then it won't be cheap to re manufacture an it will it will be cheap sorry to re manufacture
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0008544_0009352	right um this is our conceptual design meeting um i think we're slightly ahead of our selves
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0209428_0210011	and you would just have a d across the b you would have so many different options that you could do
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0065588_0065718	is it really gonna be enough
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0227763_0228698	um that seems to make sense but if it turns out that it's huge expensive we'd have to cut down somewhere else then it's worth thinking about
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0011269_0011501	so i think we've touched on a few things
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0219083_0219306	so are we looking at voice recognition
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0077618_0077833	but yeah so the d
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0148592_0148738	okay oh
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0064002_0064729	but then if you think about a watch it's on your wrist so it's on your body it's on your body time so you're walking around
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0197709_0198266	for the battery design i think plastic w yeah we could use the battery
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0071725_0071915	that they're expensive they don't
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0188079_0188197	and you could yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0195977_0196170	so sorry could you repeat that last part
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0192808_0193128	the buttons what did you give us as our
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0118872_0119263	well that's been really popular with mobile phones so i don't see why not
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0194471_0194948	on the top one okay you got the touch okay and then
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0055701_0055969	my pretty sure that solar is from the sun
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0187652_0187765	yeah okay
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0079932_0080195	yeah i think y i think it would yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0050799_0051223	and then you pick it up and then wind it for two minutes and then that's it for the night
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0157634_0157921	so basically a person you do not point at click or uh is
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0180270_0180650	so we agree on
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0078967_0079783	uh i don't think you'd d i think the it would t well you know how long the standard uh doubles would last in or triple plates would last
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0051215_0051688	yeah yeah uh yeah i yeah i presume you wouldn't have to wind it for very long
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0153441_0153591	you'll you'll see this
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0172555_0173179	but yeah we can take inspiration from fruit colours like the vibrant colours or red chili uh
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0094354_0094603	if you if you see how thin the traces are
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0053146_0053294	that doesn't count now does it
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0182425_0182687	it's a b it's it's like a g it's a gadget it's a
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0164949_0165076	and the lower it is
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0128876_0129431	if we for example had a shell once we open that yes it would be yeah yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0164344_0164499	okay and you mean to the
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0152292_0152729	and um second thing is there's too much of confusion here
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0039096_0039596	especially if you do them on too tight and you can't get the leadership on them to undo them
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0139363_0139573	yeah yeah that that would be fairly simple
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0114170_0115100	because of the expense of how much titanium is it's it's light and strong but i think it should be left for a ear curve design rather than for a
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0190615_0190857	so it it's a lot small that so it would
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0202008_0202770	we could make it um sica delicate you know we could make it black and white zap stripes
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0069823_0069960	like a ju kind of
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0228698_0229151	but i think we'll find out about cost afterwards
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0226150_0226432	did we i know the last meeting we spoke about a beeper
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0012602_0013372	um we had a couple of um changes in our plans in that we couldn't use teletext
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0199597_0200180	and it is just uh all of it's rubberised and spongy apart from that we're just going to go for a sort of edible and fruit colours
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0212288_0212491	the coppery you could talk of a copper process
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0132981_0133449	that's just another idea i don't have it helps with that but just to do with the r. s. i.
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0029420_0029974	now i should point out that the first of those findings fancy look and feel is these most important
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0220154_0220323	oh yeah yeah the whistle ones yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0223061_0223585	it's not just a case of having a little r. r. hidden somewhere they do want it to be obvious that it's our our product don't they
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0011664_0011891	to do that already but we'll just go over it
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0186520_0186655	the l. c. d. is not cheap
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0173301_0174236	two thirty nine or whatever and second thing is s certain standard buttons we should have like for example if you see the previous slide uh
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0219094_0219334	yes it was just it was just a cost us per hour with that
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0019333_0019451	just connect up
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0136485_0136741	if you keep punching with an point over it
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0000002_0000202	oh wait until you're all um hooked up
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0128514_0128876	uh so sorry to interrupt i don't see why the curved thing is a problem
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0193474_0193716	the battery board l. c. d. or
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0187432_0187668	and then they use them in calculations so
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0138042_0138503	that just one small question before like you this thing regarding the circuit since we have a having a flip up
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0112823_0113240	yeah in in titanium i don't i don't think it would be available at all really
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0025849_0026370	also with our company um being forwarders in uh putting fashion into technology
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0073243_0073799	it's it i think they're not very resistant to dropping
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0146202_0146611	trying to think of other features we can build in that won't cost too much but we'll maybe leave that one on the side
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0220425_0220813	so we can if financially voice recognition is not feasible we could go for a whistle
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0074029_0074161	well they're not designed
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0035432_0035654	we're interested to see what our design people make of that
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0109818_0110496	whereas if you come to plastic they can they can be a little more they can they can do sort of curved shapes
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0178865_0179014	okay
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0050494_0050799	how what kind of how long can you get out of that
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0032413_0033086	um we found from our um customers in paris and milan who d attended all the design and fashion fears then
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0065538_0066039	yeah but then again i i think it is because if you think about it the watch
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0125060_0125310	so i didn't get the last part you talking of
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0042252_0042507	okay first uh the
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0210011_0210708	you could have um a plain black one you could have s partly pinky ones for your little
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0059834_0060386	uh i mean the amount the amount of probably moving around you'd be doing all the time would would charge it up
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0148117_0148530	oh i think we'll be forget about the material that's just a very quick passing thought yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0068323_0068437	yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0163533_0164442	that's what i was just saying and then have the and then have the the l. c. d. at the top and then be able to touch that for the other controls
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0205544_0205727	ah it it's different
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0189165_0189312	do you want like a backup
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0229151_0229325	right i'm going to wrap it up there
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0085715_0086369	it's not something that's come up in any of our uh focus groups and market research it's not a thing that people are looking for
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0132839_0133139	yeah i hadn't i hadn't really thought of that to be honest
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0058059_0058272	um but then it would be charging for the delay
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0129595_0129708	have i missed understood you
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0125566_0125997	just what you said uh i didn't get the uh meeting of it completely he's like
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0081231_0081853	shouldn't we do some market research on that first before we add it in because i i personally right okay
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0184800_0184921	think the only
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0146938_0147093	uh i mean you can't you could do it
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0232570_0232677	is that everyone happy
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0075365_0076057	oh in calculators you don't really throw around a lot what is remotes you do they can't ten
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0225419_0226057	the point is that it's got to stand out somehow differently but i think it does without that so i'm not worried about that
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0135045_0135233	that would have to be attached
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0133449_0133915	is it possible just as an option when we open up people can use their fingers to press the button
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0181831_0182425	the you know that it sits in then pressing the button then having so we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0116388_0116511	rubber yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0136802_0137175	yeah just i thought they wouldn't actually need one and they could use anything they've got couldn't they
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0170898_0171243	so we we can check into the financial feasibility of incorporating this
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0048454_0049370	so we w i saw the um the standard double a. and triple a. which we thought were a bit bit too bulky at the moment
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0030783_0031218	so possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third it's still important
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0223838_0224119	so it's the only one of its kind on the market it's obviously gonna be our
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0028144_0028599	rather than the the current functional look and feel of a remote controls
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0108608_0109417	quite um there's quite a few design restrictions that they've got on the shape of the case
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0109417_0109818	if you go for titanium they can only do a standard box shape
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0159281_0159776	so he do not use a point to keep changing the channel if a person is frequent of uh
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0112363_0112923	so is that feature available in like uh titanium or it's like only specific to plastic
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0064729_0065014	you're doing things it is moving a lot of the time
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0198266_0198782	for instance and uh rubber as a padding or for the grips something like to add to the design
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0162747_0162868	isn't that the idea
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0137175_0137398	uh panel a pen so it wouldn't really need either
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0198820_0199377	um so we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell variety of designs okay
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0226986_0227165	yeah it's depending on the expense of it
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0208684_0209080	we looked at those remotes i mean they are kind of a normal very similar looking things
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0155214_0156212	we are going to have m maybe a gui g. u. i. interface in the f in the middle of the flip top and graphic user interface basically which is what we do do in computer
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0084553_0084817	you you wouldn't lose it so much
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0031218_0031695	but it's third in order of preference for the the subject group we looked at
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0117608_0117718	something like
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0186500_0187432	yeah just th th well it's it's not as expensive as it would be if it was full colour 'cause if you've just got a black and white one
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0221703_0221964	and incorporating the company logo
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0188370_0188958	yeah but we talked about kinetic charging we deci seemed to decide on that did we decide on double a. or triple a. batteries
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0216871_0217586	rubberise buttons on the bottom side we're gonna use fruit and vegetable colours for the rubber cover the case itself is plastic
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0212456_0213177	like a pufer phase you could just you could take it wherever so i think that's quite an flexible thing
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0036742_0036901	now yet
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0190840_0191062	got you on that okay didn't realize
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0132237_0132764	now how would you distinguish if you had it bear how would you distinguish where you had to press i mean
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0038856_0038972	hide those little things
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0100491_0101417	um the case material i've uh been sent what the factory can actually give us
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0037104_0037309	um just thank you
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0142893_0143138	and they kind of respond to the turn of your body
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0101417_0102327	the there's the plastic which i think we were gonna go for anyway as the main case case housing and
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0040302_0040472	okay is that
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0133915_0134516	or we have inside like a small pointer thing if people want to
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0110496_0110920	but whether whether or not because we would have it in two separate units
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0125432_0125558	oh what one
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0058272_0058872	and i think the point is it charges through the day and then you've got it charged for the evening
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0022936_0023239	the methods we use to decide on uh
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0226877_0227640	depending on how i'm i mean we've got this memo saying that it's something that the company's looking into so
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0008008_0008387	welcome back everybody hope you've had fun
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0148283_0148597	okay okay
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0161564_0161743	because if you're thinking about holding it
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0216382_0216871	um the l. c. d. display on the the top side of the flip top
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0153118_0153286	like some some people have uh
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0176145_0176343	are that volume and channel
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0016044_0016539	we were thinking of a shell but something along those lines just a different shape from what normal um
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0053742_0053910	oh right it
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0226030_0226150	okay
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0099218_0099999	but you could you could have lights behind the buttons and um after like five or ten seconds and not being used i'd t have that turned off
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0039387_0039590	oh no
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0145952_0146152	yeah i know no
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0142008_0142721	now you know how you've got some mirrors in light bulbs that are mirrors when you turn to them and you turn away and it gives like an advertising display
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0111147_0111276	hung yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0077497_0077618	yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0116500_0116979	that would give the spongy feel that that also allows us to kind of have different fascio for the phone
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0138503_0139147	we can customise the two circuits for different type of buttons like we are keeping the standard buttons on the top and the more complex buttons in this thing
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0139147_0139304	so we can divide the circuit like you know
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0206423_0207105	so sort of base and black um do you either want something that goes with that
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0180781_0180899	do we agree on the battery
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0224476_0225035	um you assume the name with the individual product that it is and that does the work for you
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0070774_0071499	if you uh like on a calculator they they're quite they're quite big and they're all they're all they're all they're all they're all they're all they're all they're all they're quite big and they're all they're all they're all they're all they're all they're all they're all they're all they're quite big and they're all they're all they're all they're all they're all they're all they're all they're all they're all they're all they're all they're quite big and they're all they're all they're all they're all they're all they're all they're all they're all they're all they're all they're all they're all they're all they're all they're all they're all they're all they're all they're all they're all they're all they're all they're all they're all they're all they're all they're all they're all they're all they
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0165562_0165774	so the findings are too many cluttered buttons
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0131235_0131449	it think it would be good to have a contrast between
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0107867_0108482	um the problem with the casing is that uh there's
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0077596_0077934	our remote control so we have to s look at the lights also
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0118463_0118836	very cheap way of changing the look of it and people can just buy a new one if they want to
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0076239_0076697	yeah they do they yeah they they've got dual things but they the batteries are small i think
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0175151_0175720	so we we would not change your that particular part because it i this is the most consistent thing in all remote controls
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0086804_0087020	but something to put on the side to think about maybe
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0035729_0035965	okay thank you very much
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0231623_0232110	we only had forty minutes to discuss what we just discussed and don't know how long that took you
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0001757_0001913	oh great great
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0028599_0028955	the alsh also want a remote control to be technologically innovative
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0054598_0055216	so maybe it's standard triple a. might take less space or an dynamic might take more space
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0072299_0073132	yeah the normal batteries would be the cheapest i'd presume uh then it would actually be the the solar charging ones um but the
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0147093_0147921	you could have a 'cause if you if you just put the full charge through an l. c. d. display or completely blank it out
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0223557_0224476	well they do but i think we can you could it well it is it is i think you just address that with um advertising
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0134328_0134463	like the palm pops thing
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0210551_0210871	well the thing is the rubberise covers are going to be so relatively cheap to produce
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0087220_0087329	okay well i'm move on
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0160312_0160780	on the top we have these button remotes to keep frequently changing the channels
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0111124_0111763	second thing is yeah and second question is like uh mobile you can change the cover you call it a skin or whatever
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0078600_0078967	badges and the solar charging um
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0193636_0194134	yeah the i think we wa we're going for the l. c. d. on that one on the buttons
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0141902_0142008	if we flip open
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0153591_0153741	the cost is on uh i i
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0117621_0118084	like those pens that you get a grip that you can you can pull that off
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0118192_0118395	it could it would be comfortable to hold on and so
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0195625_0195847	okay okay
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0069148_0069726	could people put standard batteries in but with s you know they could leave it in the sunset for solar charging or the two things not compatible
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0217586_0217853	that's how far we've got what else do we have to add to our decisions here
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0140740_0141112	because in the in the actual flip that you'd have some linking
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0034013_0034785	there's also seems to be um a trend towards a spongy feel to materials uh again in contrast to last year
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0021898_0022800	okay um so we decided on our market and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0135041_0135232	but easy to replace as well cheap
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0071449_0071648	so that effect the exterior design
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0166384_0166613	all are confusing and in inconsistent
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0128504_0128659	but also with the
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0017939_0018862	um and our market is going to be young business kind of range
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0077962_0078479	the yeah the the s if you if you had something jo uh using the standard
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0031695_0032413	okay um no the fashion update which releases to very personal preferences among our subjective group
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0029974_0030639	it's twice as important as the second technologically innovative which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0034785_0035432	so a lot of interesting feedback back to our market research department and from our people in paris and milan
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0213742_0214102	it should be m bundled it with the design in such a way you can change it every time
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0159878_0160312	so we are having a combination of both so f on this simple board
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0184662_0184793	think that would be quite fun
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0137738_0138096	yeah that's the yeah that that's the end of m my
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0080978_0081433	because if we're doing the kinetic thing and it's
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0129140_0129293	oh it would be flat inside
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0067333_0067624	and uh the for the same the same reason
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0198019_0198162	plastic okay
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0116994_0117621	so instead of the fashion that comes off being plastic the fashion that comes off would be the rubber
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0144866_0144989	well it's a good concept
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0166613_0166912	okay we had a latest finding of voice recognition there was a mail
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0167049_0167557	which means that our division has developed a new speech recognition s feature
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0201858_0202008	so we could make it red
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0122835_0123831	but i thought that an l. c. d. type of screen 'cause one they're incredibly thin um and don't take up much space
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0158012_0158431	press any d particular device he just has to click on that particular icon to simplify
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0088899_0089550	which basically has these contacts that are really close together and then when you press down on the rubber button
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0203384_0203662	so we could just pick anything
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0156418_0156912	if you if yeah if you have like buttons that appear on the screen and this l. c. d. screen
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0205521_0206423	it's just different it's just different from everything else and i mean i'm trying to imagine um clean looking houses
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0169527_0170446	some kind of thing or it gives a b b pop sound or some kind of sound and this can be incorporated this would be more um you can say trendy also
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0209080_0209463	this would definitely be different enough i just wanted if anybody could come up with something even more
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0182295_0182473	yeah i think i mean if
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0055103_0055725	yeah it would the the yeah the dynamic would take more space 'cause you'd actually need a physical sort of handle to wind up
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0181145_0181306	yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0017331_0017939	and we're gonna think about the port and an alarm for getting it lost things like that
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0042623_0042742	into the method
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0060386_0060805	uh i don't think you'd ever need to actually physically start shaking it up to make it work
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0147921_0148233	but i don't know if you could get any merit effect on it i'm not sure if it
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0203764_0204429	is that going to be this image i've got in my head of something kind of shaped like that maybe about that size
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0059062_0059834	the the kinetic charging which is like you get it in ri you get it in rich watches and you d you don't even notice it
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0111763_0112363	so in this case if you're looking at like a custom can change the colour like from green pattern to telly red or something like that
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0096908_0097666	and then to uh yeah so to conserve battery life the remote should be in a standby mode not well not being used
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0172153_0172555	they want something to do with fruit so i wouldn't say that design should be like a fruit
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0084951_0085271	but then maybe that's looking at someone who's just sitting on their own rather than
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0060854_0061353	and are these like oh what the life of the kinetic battery it uh like it runs for a long time
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0211630_0212456	and one's the ones that have rubber spies y you know you could just go so far with it
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0122465_0122835	um the second option th they offer a rubber buttons
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0158431_0159281	and on the top repetitive buttons which are like volume or channel changing and on could be on the pointing device that means use of button
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0018862_0019193	okay so should we start with the first presentation
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0163508_0163805	yeah yeah but you can't do it with your thumb like
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0065289_0065588	then you pick it up to change it and then you put it on the side
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0075916_0076308	it do get a bit of work but don't calculators have a battery in them as well
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0113240_0113765	the ju just it will well you could make it available in the titanium you
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0016897_0017210	you were going to look into the rechargeable batteries
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0187746_0187925	maybe we could start with the black and white
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0207105_0207294	which is what on the market anyway
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0044473_0045055	because some of the things that we looked at last time aren't un unfortunately aren't available
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0045266_0045596	um findings i've got my nice little picture there
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0215226_0215710	okay we've got five minutes um or that might have been up for a while
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0054083_0054598	according to the sizes which one you think will be like because we we have to take into consideration size also
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0144989_0145772	you were sitting watching t. v. are you gonna want to sort of open it and say oh che you're going have a charger and do my hair before i for the t
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0099999_0100304	if we decided to go for buttons that could light up
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0047486_0047853	um and then we we lo looking into battery options
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0160946_0161428	can we stop that round so that the ones that we use all the time or on the bottom part
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0161877_0162283	you would be using your thumbs to press just like a mobile phone
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0079650_0080160	it would just disrupt from the attractiveness of the of the whole feature w it's not gonna add anything okay
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0215644_0216382	so could i just recap uh seria for the decisions that we've made kinetic charging the watch type batteries
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0041083_0041188	okay
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0115944_0116500	that's just wondering if we make the basic mould out of plastic but have like a rubber cover that goes over
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0053378_0053790	that thought it was v. c. like a
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0091816_0091988	what kind of things do we have to consider there
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0049370_0050219	dynamic charging i thought that that might be a bit silly to be to be honest peo it's it's basically like wind up radio
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0155824_0155938	which means
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0053232_0053491	does does light charge us as as sunlight does
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0146099_0146202	okay
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0229632_0230258	it could uh end meeting now
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0036429_0036582	yeah okay can i just
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0009601_0009826	yeah yeah i was getting that impression as well
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0024933_0025119	so project manager
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0185031_0185833	think the only problem that we would have would be how much it's going to cost if that means we have to cut down somewhere else
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0200180_0200831	we're not gonna try and make it actually a vegetable or fruit design or anything else like a shell that we discussed to go for the colours
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0204429_0204917	made of plastic fits into the palm of the hand rubberised cover that's spongy
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0129906_0130571	it wouldn't be like full colour it would just be black and white but there'd be touch touch buttons
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0113765_0114170	it's just it would be so expensive to buy a new case for it
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0056191_0056303	optional light now
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0189926_0190502	you know the kinetic ones come c come with um a sort of w watch uh battery that goes in a watch
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0232171_0232396	and i think we're p pretty going in a clear direction now
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0168273_0169125	but for like we had a c um s response from the customers that they would like to have the feature of finding it
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0145424_0146099	it's with as using the ideas from mobile so it's for us using the ideas for mobile phones i kinda gotta side track onto that i think
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0056835_0057300	and i mean people who live in basic flats there's not that many people but there are people
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0025656_0025849	so that was one of the first things we did
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0062662_0062874	because they use them quite frequently and watches
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0071528_0071765	so a little would be slightly big expensive
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0096359_0096753	array of switches which i'll speak about in the next bit so that
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0102459_0103250	the the main problems with the well you could go for wood but i think it would be a bit impractical
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0033505_0033912	so should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0162257_0162492	now you told it you do you flip it open and you'd be
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0155760_0155881	so what does that stand for
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0154928_0155214	okay and second as already discussed with volume
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0137923_0138131	that's your right okay
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0150802_0151570	so you generally see there's not not much of a variety and like marketing teams said uh people need trendy they are both of black and white
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0019210_0019333	okay
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0111136_0111242	uh for the flip in
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0071616_0071774	expensive as well
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0046596_0047486	based on your input and um it's pretty much used for all all t. v. remotes at the moment
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0047986_0048454	there's um actually no rechargeable option available
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0119182_0119294	oh
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0013372_0014280	it wasn't gonna be control for everything um and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0144533_0144638	they don't look at themselves
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0174354_0174537	well uh yeah we
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0115444_0115944	got a mobile phone myself which is titanium and it does mark very easily if you drop it
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0098463_0099218	so you can see what all the buttons are like on a mobile phone they do it uh more often than on a than on a t. v. remote
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0072058_0072205	it's twelve point f
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0170446_0170664	and technologically innovative also
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0071774_0072311	what kind of price are we looking at for i presume the normal batteries are the cheapest
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0033086_0033505	the fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes shoes and furniture
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0025119_0025656	um we decided on the most important aspects i uh required in a remote control device and we'll come to that later
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0144155_0144495	we're marketing to guys as much as we are to women
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0050012_0050260	like a right okay
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0009477_0009969	from the last meeting i th i think yeah um
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0130571_0131188	so you wouldn't be pressing down on them w or we could have rubber buttons which are made of this material which is anti r. s. i.
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0153858_0154292	they found out that the o only common feature is the ch uh channel control and the volume control
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0156212_0156505	have icons or touch pad over uh which is
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0050219_0050626	so you wind up your remote control before you use it
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0127015_0127827	but um you can you wouldn't have with the l. c. d. you'd have the wires coming off you wouldn't have that with the
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0232867_0233179	okay
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0219578_0219981	oh maybe like uh volume was adjusting in the last thing some devices you put on keys and things
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0230519_0231255	so i think we've probably got it says closing we have forty minutes so um i think we're probably got about that time before we come back
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0152729_0152905	the no particular remote control
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0122071_0122465	overall if you had them close enough that would be one option
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0104324_0105188	well you're saying that people like this uh spongy feel this year so perhaps uh some something made of rubber
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0023460_0023678	current trends and so on market trends
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0188073_0188307	that that would could upgrade later on up
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0029089_0029420	and of course as we produced that it should be easy to use
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0105785_0106024	that they've they've uh put a cost
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0184148_0184662	so do you reckon that's a good idea that where's the remote i'm here thing
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0068177_0068398	so it's not the draw on it isn't
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0151570_0152116	so you generally see reject technical shape very monotonous kind of designs yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0075002_0075156	physical wise okay
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0137437_0137923	okay we'll talk about that so if you finish your and we'll come back to that
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0036543_0036742	until that anyone has any questions about that
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0182707_0183573	yeah it is it is quite it's quite a cool feature to have and also if they've got it if they've got these parts already in stock
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0081629_0081912	we'll add it in to think about um
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0227609_0227779	and they've got in stocks so yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0091988_0092807	can we what kind of size does it come in varying sizes or is it just one size and we would have to fit the design of
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0064990_0065140	yeah and
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0176429_0177106	so keep that m that standard because that's the most common feature across all models if you look at all the models it's here
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0194134_0194770	on the on the on the top one we're gonna yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0225035_0225419	obviously we'll have a logo on it just like everything but everything else has a logo on it
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0021791_0021898	okay
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0080799_0080978	can we think about that
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0167557_0168273	we have to kick into the f financial f feasibility whether we can incorporate that this at a low cost
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0051688_0052412	but i don't i don't think it's really sort of necessary when you th you think as the the next two options
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0174609_0175151	uh i think most of the users would now be well acquainted with this cert central pattern here
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0106153_0106991	uh what is used in some stressful manufacturer and it's made to be anti r. s. i.
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0053961_0054086	any any
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0199200_0199392	oh i think so i think so
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0171623_0172153	my personal preferences would be like as already high rated but m uh marketing department
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0057116_0057532	uh no in different parts of the world too if we're if we're marketing internationally
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0049745_0049886	but can you explain that
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0097666_0098463	now what i was thinking about that was 'cause sometimes when when you have these things you've got a little lights on behind the buttons
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0219334_0219636	but it's a good idea we just need to check on the cost is that right
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0211662_0211788	which is another beauty of it
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0106991_0107867	uh i'm uh i'm not sure how that would work because s surely your fingers would still be moving over the short distances but that's what they said
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0117431_0117601	like a rubber sleeve almost yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0143138_0144102	is it possible that when we open our flip top shell it's a little compact metal and when you press a button it then goes on to the phone display the the or the remote control display thing
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0026370_0026908	we also looked at a fashion update um using our customers on fashion and design in paris and milan
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0092714_0093013	well this the thi the thing about it is um
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0117863_0117973	alright
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0156891_0157538	like you have on your l uh icons something you have is a good example of g. uh graphic user interface
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0055977_0056085	yeah okay
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0197144_0197260	and for those sorry
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0149677_0150290	especially from the marketing and industrial design to check on the customer needs and feasibility
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0038097_0038352	let's screw in that we got it
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0116863_0117008	and you can peel them off yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0212137_0212251	you can you can just
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0181306_0181831	um that means that there's no function for l the port
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0115209_0115444	it does more quite easily to if you let it fall
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0196178_0197020	um okay on we've got the flip the flip screen the top one is gonna be the l. c. d. and the bottom one is gonna be the rubberised buttons
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0043948_0044473	um also in this study i've looked into the availability of some materials
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0057514_0058039	yeah and most people most people also watch t. v. in the in the night anyway
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0036149_0036391	let's start from the inside and work my way out
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0202770_0203384	but that's not really what we're focussing on on what we're focussing on is the m you know yes
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0189474_0189743	and i thought of a remote control with a flip up
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0010093_0010200	oh let's
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0150760_0151132	because they they were saying they were quite willing to pay more for a better product
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0080119_0080264	yeah that's
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0029767_0030462	it would need two separate p. c. b. s that would be joined at the hinge through some sort of cableling
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0088855_0089231	so maybe because there's more space it's not kind of moving around turn on turn on
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0206619_0207514	um our costs are below budget with recommendations that they the budget be increased but i think i don't know d what do you think
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0056932_0057098	so i won't write all of that out again
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0151558_0151753	make it copy
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0157060_0157389	twelve point three five
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0166372_0166561	product evaluation
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0211269_0211781	and i think they'll all be another project team or a new project for us to look at at those kind of things
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0202851_0203137	there are innovations in that people do really want
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0119730_0119868	so what's the single curve then
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0107878_0108004	you want me to unplug that
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0007631_0008203	um and the rubber buttons that we'll use will be anti r. s. i.
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0055519_0056226	yes we're going to come to w we'll discuss each one and we'll come to our consensus rating between one and seven
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0020371_0020670	how do you say it's yeah yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0184842_0184984	but it was nice having it there
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0160473_0160647	so half of the price would be
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0102431_0102558	think we yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0211781_0212244	it don't think that's something we have to look at and find a way of raising the cash for it
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0201108_0201817	think it's really good that this has been very market research based because just going back to mobile phones
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0097280_0097564	one and one get
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0184614_0184842	although than having to email it yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0153981_0154491	um as you say we can offer the voice recognition initially to business class customers and
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0065308_0065495	outside four
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0077244_0077443	one point seven five
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0023655_0023993	yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0028476_0029174	um the standard there's be a standard transmission with the t. v. using using all the standard chips that we've talked about
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0125843_0126008	it's including it's including
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0089806_0089981	right
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0051764_0052317	though that did seem to be the favourite strategy but there was also on the side line the thought of maybe having a beeper function
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0060022_0060152	how about that
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0071665_0071800	it's a very slightly altered
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0142747_0142880	if we try m
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0046975_0047249	so this is the first stage of the evaluation
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0052880_0053466	oh just show you how we're going to evaluate our own feedback to this to what we have so far
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0049991_0050845	it should incorporate current fashion trends and those are the two main ones they were the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colours
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0157389_0157688	is it twelve point five was it twelve point fifty
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0092561_0092947	and finally last but not least easy to locate
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0062886_0063141	my own rating for that would be a two
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0199206_0199556	but people could have have anything that they wanted
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0082589_0083208	nei no 'cause it that's that's the the spongy feel would be in the rubber that you put round it
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0146418_0146869	now 'cause it's sample sensor sample speaker
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0096899_0097072	logical
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0139789_0139960	now it's just prices one
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0042707_0043170	it's to be presented
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0141642_0141956	we haven't been dealing we haven't been dealing with documents there i think
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0040229_0040867	now not informing with the l the whole look of the the the product when it's out on the thing
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0153309_0153981	but our object is so distinctive that that in itself is gonna make it easier to locate is uh you know in the first instance
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0015277_0015894	it's gonna have a a plastic body um with a sort of standard colour i
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0124252_0124459	let's we're not using a lot of rubber actually
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0079543_0080152	so i'm just thinking before i give it my rating you were limited in the use of materials for your prototype here
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0003390_0003552	okay um
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0085499_0085694	uh i don't think we've really touched on that a lot
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0096244_0096449	so it would be s but yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0026723_0026955	it w it won't shout out i'm here or something
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0146869_0147206	you took away that that will make it twelve point three five
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0058075_0058416	this is where i realise how tiny i actually am
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0203137_0203687	and i think people wanting a model of the phone they're really happy with and they can't get it anymore and it's innovation for innovation sake
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0168369_0168523	yes
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0048836_0049116	now the findings that we came up with is just a recap our here
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0020479_0020798	uh black and white screen where in people can
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0033228_0033450	in fact it could be here also
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0193678_0194216	because this was something we should think about but obviously no ones put any great deal of thought into it
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0099508_0100102	that is for um incorporates current fashion trends and is easy to locate
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0061602_0061753	okay
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0045421_0045600	okay
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0119093_0119208	single coat
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0203973_0204308	well it's innovation for money sake
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0040867_0041709	and finally that's how we put the fashion back into electronics as that is that's the company logo
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0009468_0009897	me and wilhelm booked on a prototype and i think wilhelm is going to make a p presentation on that
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0094033_0094237	and uh we're happy with the costs on that
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0102690_0103123	and i think for most of those ratings it's it's high enough at the upper end of the scale for us to go ahead with that
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0182963_0183503	yeah i think i think we probably would have used the actual email system more it had we actually
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0082154_0082482	yeah yeah yeah and
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0047249_0047547	now the collection of the criteria as we saw on our previous meeting
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0189996_0190296	yeah i think it's new ideas in general rather than
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0215214_0215890	oh so we've got about fifty minutes to catch up with everything that i fell behind with
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0010325_0010586	make sure the cameras
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0162370_0162501	yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0093601_0093754	voice recognition
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0048158_0048619	so it's what we've discussed in the last meeting are we actually meeting those trends and requirements
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0152756_0153037	but we need to work to that specification to start with
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0169504_0169624	yeah let's say it's a two
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0191709_0191888	well they have to come from somewhere don't they
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0213821_0213994	uh it's tough secret
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0042426_0042675	so this is the one
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0173955_0174893	uh i feel that every one was listed to and all the points that were raised seemed to have been sorted out
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0103308_0103946	on the basis of current technology and our current capabilities we could actually do much more to minimise that
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0146133_0146305	oh oh
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0059577_0060022	actually it might be an idea if we each did give our own individual rating and we could take an average at the end
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0116994_0117120	oh right okay
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0071037_0071182	is that what you're saying
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0070603_0070757	yeah i i just thought it that the
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0219792_0219958	that's your turn
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0058297_0058533	just right sammy
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0212398_0213152	think we've done very well to get within budget and it still makes such an innovative item but i think people are really gonna want
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0039904_0040303	but not interfering with the outside kind of look of the product once it's
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0213477_0213648	uh maybe it will
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0151180_0151459	but we are still working to um head up
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0220460_0220881	was that not the questionnaire for the how you felt you done in your
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0205290_0205582	because the phones have moved on things like that
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0220084_0220492	well i didn't have to rate you on how much you influence the meeting this time
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0155506_0155799	because we've done all the background work to go for that if they want it
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0008858_0009029	prototype presentation
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0072117_0072286	just two point five for that one
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0167748_0167997	apparently we discussed leadership and teamwork
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0169656_0170315	oh we had our separate tasks that was so much interruption so much that we needed to um bounce off each other
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0150154_0150760	but they but i mean th in the i don't see why we have to sell a lot of twenty five euros now
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0004709_0004997	uh gonna be a problem factor
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0002738_0002856	okay you'll switch on
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0195447_0195953	they they don't really think about it because normally the remote control isn't the product which they're trying to ship
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0114509_0114789	right what's happening with the electronics
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0155625_0156026	they like their gadgets they like something that's completely different
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0080152_0080387	is this actually going to be the colours that you would choose
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0118064_0118366	yeah one of them and one sample sensor in sample speaker
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0165580_0165807	except voice recognition everything is
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0060152_0060278	okay
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0119850_0120257	yeah i'd say i'd say i'd say it's w yeah i think i think it's
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0125385_0125843	so we're not actually using plastic in the case are we
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0208471_0208983	and the the haunting for the building you think our budget includes everything all the costs that are going out
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0137358_0137594	instead of going for kinetic energy going for a standard battery
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0034391_0034801	and then finally um onto the interface
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0063870_0064567	yeah d yeah i'd probably put it uh w t two yeah two or three
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0017582_0017838	but we can we can we can come up with that
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0104500_0104817	is there anything you would like to to ask me about the findings before uh
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0141989_0142114	alright i think it's a new uh
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0080340_0081046	nee no the the the base colour was um white or or like or l sort of a light blue
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0033990_0034391	so when you've actually got it open it would be facing the t. v.
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0151568_0151710	we can put in our recommendations
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0057098_0057436	that will just be criteria one two three four five six or e. p.
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0062660_0062886	one is true seven is false
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0022666_0023422	thinking about it now could you could also probably attach to the flipping open and shout as well so that you could probably get a bit of
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0072878_0073085	one is digital true sixty is false so that's okay
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0204238_0204421	yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0154748_0155625	make the price fit and then say if we'd had our budget we would have had this because it also sets up our profit
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0193197_0193678	mean there's slightly different so someone's been shouting in a room and said make ours a bit different from everyone else
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0128633_0128764	yeah okay
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0124679_0124956	oh very low priority of rubber compared to plastic
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0074155_0074366	okay ease of use
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0147361_0147641	if we change it to the battery it's that's minus three
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0074366_0074483	easy to use
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0151326_0151659	so should we just change your design
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0148868_0149309	we can do it some other way we can d it doesn't have to be voice recognition
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0102290_0102604	but i think yeah i think yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0130421_0130825	yeah the push buttons one and l. c. d. display one
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0023549_0023655	yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0113715_0113995	so it would have been handy to have this at the beginning
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0025272_0025780	so you'd have something like wha you'd shout out where where is the remote and
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0115809_0115964	oh no no no no the um
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0169188_0169806	or did you feel like uh d autonomy
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0091763_0091965	twenty one that twenty one
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0027237_0027350	and i'm under the sofa
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0172218_0172557	we came to a very precise creative design yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0122756_0123099	now i think rubber since it's being used just as a casing we can put point five
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0081861_0082312	so we could use any strong fruit and veg colours and that's what we're intending to do
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0149309_0150037	we could do the voice recognition for you know business class or something you know like it upgraded version
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0084388_0084676	that part is nice and easy
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0146166_0146338	so we see what difference it makes
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0154997_0155203	and then say we recommend
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0204308_0204544	that the people have to keep buying
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0073581_0073734	so that is eight
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0024997_0025272	so we presume that that that'll also be quite cheap
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0021493_0021601	oh right okay yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0003272_0003390	person we got to go
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0029123_0029262	infrared sensors
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0010830_0010982	could i just nick you
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0216751_0216948	celebration you didn't talk about that
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0140518_0141065	it c it might uh you ma you might be assuming that that is in euros
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0204579_0204892	it thinks that you know they might want to buy the thing they really want
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0184151_0184614	yeah 'cause we could just sort of say sorry what did you say about that or what do you think about that
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0077566_0077898	are we if we want to really bring it down we cannot do later
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0163626_0163776	nei
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0126728_0127172	but it's gonna be part of the total cost and there's nowhere else we can we can put that in is there
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0175366_0176275	and i think i would have made it into the final product if it was actually if if we'd seen the marketing before the initial specification was put out
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0191020_0191204	that's mine
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0055079_0055182	oh it's perfect
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0027108_0027237	okay
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0082600_0082771	yeah because you'll be having uh
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0217288_0217464	either that or we'll be dancing on the desk
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0178669_0178828	uh like that
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0139563_0139785	that's not much anymore
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0074599_0074946	based on what you've said there i would say a one true
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0197713_0198494	mean they could even go into um you go in with an idea and they design it on prototype and then they just get it printed on the plastic
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0194451_0194929	they're just like we've got a d. v. d. player is there anyone remember the remote control
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0196007_0196202	yeah the focus isn't on to that yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0203687_0203961	and i think it's wonderful that our company's so r. and d. based
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0180677_0181283	maybe we should think of branding out into children's toys and fake mobile phones as the side line
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0126045_0126679	so that shouldn't that shouldn't be actually on there because that's not incorporated in the cost of the remote you get
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0073734_0073991	that brings it down to two nice and simple yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0160150_0160473	that doesn't know what it said fifty percent of the cost
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0209994_0210623	so maybe increasing it you would also have to increase the price that it sold at
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0097153_0097308	yeah one
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0069005_0069175	nee now not too
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0096324_0096449	we built into the feature
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0004093_0004564	standard chip um 'cause it can come in various different sizes it wasn't uh
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0172964_0173137	and saara you coordinated the book very well
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0140434_0140639	it's not a lot though
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0144422_0144689	what i feel is custom is never said anything about the battery and all
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0112668_0113201	we just type numbers into this and we come out with the final volume
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0192299_0193197	um as we're shown by your presentation with all of the other controls remote controls no one's thought about it particularly
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0015894_0016555	either we think something uh something fairly neutral like a a white or a light blue or something
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0056304_0056520	one is true seven is false
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0044834_0045037	um i think this is a good shape
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0012537_0012988	you should have one of those things and you can just take it off
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0067463_0067945	okay criteria be criteria on be technologically innovative
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0153037_0153309	and i think the voice recognition sounds wonderful
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0000368_0000686	if you leave them on the whole time you get to look like a neutral the whole time
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0173296_0173446	how did you find it
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0073099_0073313	so you're rating for this one pub
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0047547_0048158	was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of our company
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0041912_0042199	um i've now got evaluation criteria
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0111261_0111373	now i presume
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0141567_0141760	oh i don't think so
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0208960_0209296	think it was just the produ uh just the production cost of the phone
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0137735_0138224	is that not made any d if you click off that square now it's not made any difference
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0087136_0087889	well the type of button that we're gonna use on the bottom half the material minimise is r. s. i. it's meant to
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0122178_0122445	plastic one and maybe rubber point five
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0095126_0095345	um i think it would
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0139161_0139263	and the cold flat
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0006122_0006812	um bright funky designs inspired by fruit keeping with the hip kind of feel
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0031988_0032552	um the sender would be on the p on one of the bo the bottom led
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0031657_0031836	uh and the infrared
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0084803_0085294	uh moving on to does the design minimise repetitive strain injury
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0157505_0157721	it's two point five
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0053466_0053913	we're going to use a seven point scale where one is true and seven is false
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0171331_0171714	yeah i think it is a very constructive feedback by everybody
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0020670_0021549	it would be sort of insert into the into the top and the buttons at the bottom would uh so it's so it will fully close flat
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0010362_0010480	you can hold it like
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0005672_0006122	um buttons with a combination of l. c. d. and rubber according to the design
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0152684_0152856	we we could s
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0140346_0140507	it's supposed to get it down slightly
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0127172_0127484	there's no where else we can code for the the rubber used in the casing
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0120693_0121171	and wha 'cause one yeah one's double curved and then the other ones
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0125714_0125931	now no that's it's as an extra
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0071496_0071665	so i'll work out the average for that again in the end
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0006812_0007631	um and to try and incorporate voice recognition software into our design until we can find out more about the cost of things like that
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0154493_0154605	okay we can
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0104035_0104199	oh no
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0050845_0051764	the design should minimise r. s. i. and be easy to locate and we were still um a slightly ambiguous as to whether to use voice recognition there
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0111791_0111963	that um
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0068895_0069292	now that you're biased in the p the designer
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0120168_0120283	the dome thing
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0168536_0168736	um in the sense that
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0209117_0209327	oh think that was just the the physical
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0066132_0066551	uh two and three documents is that alright
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0125948_0126093	right okay
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0077898_0078492	um now we're looking at it incorporate current fashion trends
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0125074_0125261	see it says case material
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0103784_0104040	too much apart from having a huge big
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0011655_0011774	think we're crazy yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0060095_0060228	yeah so you can
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0179596_0180250	um uh i'm still not cut up
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0012988_0013135	that i don't know
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0196176_0196984	but then when it everything is really smart and you've just got this big chunk of black thing sitting on your coffee table it doesn't go
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0063252_0063448	one is true and seven is false
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0147540_0148015	they n nah yeah but you p minus three plus two
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0216954_0217203	and i think the celebration is the twenty five pounds
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0094276_0094535	yeah yeah that the yeah that's feasible
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0159456_0159566	which is less than ten p.
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0017838_0018731	um the um wide choice of colours and sort of patterns so you've got you've got a lot of customisation with it
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0033080_0033210	yeah yeah some of that
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0088191_0088855	maybe because it's slightly with the size that we've got it it's quite small but with the amount of stuff we're putting on it isn't that much
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0021549_0021771	yeah yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0158800_0158933	it's twelve point five maybe then
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0161940_0162069	kick off meeting now yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0162472_0162610	so we are under the budget
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0013863_0014453	okay so this is our look and feel presentation the final our final presentation
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0148079_0148241	it's not clear yet
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0145099_0145444	if if you take away the voice i ha i don't i don't like to say
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0128357_0128636	shou we should just put it in as one because a plastic is zero anyway
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0141636_0141773	is there anything on the menu
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0089313_0089572	it accurately the buttons in between
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0195222_0195447	yeah just adjust it up a bit
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0070718_0070863	you want your rating to be a two
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0166948_0167513	because we've got decisions that we would have made that we wouldn't didn't feel able to make
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0119293_0119443	two 'cause it's two
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0173184_0173296	thank you
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0070532_0070718	the average p for you
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0200613_0201118	and new television projects coming up but nobody giving a much idea to this
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0111556_0111672	that the screen would be blank
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0213744_0213984	maybe someone will run down and paint it
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0214736_0215214	um and if we've got the meeting summary in question oh
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0124483_0124648	it would be like saying we're using
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0033980_0034152	it's still pointing yes
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0104279_0104500	well i hope that's uh clear to the teen
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0086156_0086309	we felt could feasibly reduce that
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0214271_0214736	um the project has been evaluated well and truly
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0178399_0178669	then it didn't matter 'cause it was just another idea in the feel
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0055336_0055621	is it everybody's going to evaluate it or just the market
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0216025_0216367	uh in your yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0163089_0163418	so is that uh got us covered for the electronics then
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0072755_0073010	losing one dimensional place that's okay
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0082405_0082585	and the spongy feel is no problem with that
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0170315_0171238	and i've certainly felt heard listened to and that in relevant areas we've been able to you know given a take and adjusted our remote where necessary
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0210855_0211119	but i think in the remote that we were given it was very specific
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0083801_0083950	yeah i'll give it a one as well
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0156540_0156796	so if we take voice recognition out
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0105090_0105269	it
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0218479_0218677	um yeah just last i think
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0158190_0158482	yeah well two twelve point two five times two is
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0089981_0090294	think i think i'm gonna have to be neutral on that and give it a four
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0221542_0221919	uh think yeah questionnaire seven was the one i did just before the meeting
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0176275_0176799	it think maybe it would have come out a little different but yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0029174_0029767	um it would it would have obviously 'cause it's split over two two different leds
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0145444_0145718	but if you take away the voice recognition then you've got it
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0179060_0179486	well you two created that wonderful specification of a play doh model
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0093733_0094033	it's the immune thing yep
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0071959_0072177	okay and we're just waiting for your rating
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0129433_0129934	it might do a figure for some of them more exotic o. giriens and such like colours
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0156347_0156467	right okay so
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0042934_0043055	thank you
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0054337_0054894	and i will just do a preliminary rating of all those criteria on the white board here
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0071117_0071242	yeah i just got it
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0023326_0023877	so put it in the top section rather than the bottom section 'cause it's the top part that's okay
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0084676_0084803	okay
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0191575_0191709	yeah no
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0179596_0179920	uh think that is a best part of the
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0142723_0142945	and the interface
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0145029_0145509	and people are used to buying batteries they're not gonna say i'm not getting this 'cause i got to buy a battery for a remote control
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0013210_0013453	oh where are the images
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0182025_0182333	um to discuss which ones yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0085694_0086008	we've we've discussed it we haven't really come up with anything that
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0150037_0150218	you could choose to have that or not
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0033662_0033840	oh right yeah okay i got you
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0163776_0164224	because that that was just a bolt on extra you could just take that out
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0221156_0221346	that that don't mean
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0145866_0146022	but it's that special form
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0212327_0212444	yeah it was
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0076642_0077076	should have said a two to make the economic easy shouldn't i
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0182690_0182872	could it have been better was it adequate
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0106383_0106722	okay i've got finance here now
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0144016_0144324	the biggest one would be taking away if you took away
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0130033_0130153	interface
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0093454_0093931	yeah it was it was uh a voice voice recognition yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0105357_0105464	would have to leave it there
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0057767_0058075	be. c. d. e. f.
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0005194_0005672	the case material is gonna be soft rubbery changeable
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0039240_0039783	uh logo on it or something insert or maybe an engraving of the logo on the top
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0117466_0117955	yeah and yeah just uh no one reg uh
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0075853_0076076	it would say a two
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0065410_0065609	uh four okay
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0094641_0095029	it go for um a c we can adjust the volume on that just as we could volume on t. v.
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0206223_0206361	in closing
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0174893_0175366	though we didn't quite make the voice recognition in there but that's that's good
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0009260_0009381	that think that would be you
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0205457_0205662	or there isn't a cover to fit it or whatever yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0185717_0186263	but i think it's good like uh we spend times individually
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0077076_0077483	we'll just put all most two because i'm not gonna get into silly detailed places
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0072303_0072420	two point five okay
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0094237_0094433	uh it's going to be feasible cost wise
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0147212_0147361	well the kinetic is three
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0118818_0118949	the double curve
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0026345_0026723	and then w yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0129220_0129394	okay special colour do we need that
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0219123_0219253	possible
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0095216_0095536	so some of us in the other room or t. v.'s and different rooms or
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0060278_0060896	so i'll just separate the ratings by our bucks and if we go one two three four we know who's who
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0190483_0190922	it's it's n mean nothing is new but it's applying it to a d in a different area
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0183562_0183667	had time to kind of
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0070298_0070429	can you just make it two
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0083501_0083683	in that case it's got to be a one for me
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0123549_0123800	the thing it allows a point five euro
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0202407_0202851	we see it in mobile phones a lot and that's what we've borrowed a lot of our d ideas from
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0207514_0207752	do you think that takes into account um
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0138315_0138673	oh no it's seventeen five it's changed not a long
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0164377_0164535	and that would be fine yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0083208_0083491	that t otherwise it's just sort of hard plastic
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0033289_0033662	actually now it would be it would have to be on the on the front
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0113201_0113484	so are we still on for kinetic
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0160463_0160841	think the agenda one was where the um price was wasn't it
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0158071_0158261	sorry not mentioning to dot your words
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0176696_0176832	yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0208156_0208471	like us being well paid kind of a thing
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0193972_0194451	yeah i don't i don't think the the companies are really concerned
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0117520_0117628	so would they be two
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0093280_0093454	yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0201817_0202407	mean this is the first change in remote control devices that i can really you know say is is obvious and visible
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0025911_0026127	it'll shock back i'm here or something
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0097680_0098250	uh i do realise that we might be being fairly biased 'cause it is our product of uh
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0053913_0054337	we'll look at each of those criteria that i've just mentioned i'll call that slide back up
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0066839_0066952	yeah yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0221346_0221542	yeah the that's yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0078492_0079300	now that's particularly in relation to our market research findings about the spongy texture to the exterior and the fruit and vegetable design colours
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0070123_0070298	the first one reading i'm sorry
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0105433_0105566	okay thank you
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0213692_0214036	are gonna steal our ideas and sell it
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0080695_0080800	but for the plastic
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0028157_0028476	you can have a remote that tells you exactly where it is
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0027429_0027532	oh
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0003664_0003952	minutes um we decided to use a kinetic charger
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0162501_0162618	like i thought that's what it will
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0009137_0009262	is that for us
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0045226_0045415	it's quite similar to what it was before though
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0026214_0026708	or something
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0210588_0211064	yeah i think yeah i don't uh from the market research
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0144689_0144939	it's internal nobody looks into the battery
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0026955_0027532	it'll just charge out i'm here or something too s similar effect
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0033420_0033651	yeah on the front on the front side that yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0153005_0153128	yeah we could say
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0157721_0157907	now it's twelve point t. five
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0163055_0163217	okay
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0137174_0137358	think we could change the battery also
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0141279_0141927	and then would be fine because the exchange rate would make it about twelve
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0139752_0139857	now we will have
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0190085_0190483	actually boring from other areas it's you know bringing things from other areas in
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0183706_0184183	had had more time and if we'd been separated it more
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0209312_0209994	so it looks well it looks like it's gonna be fifty percent profit you've still got all of the overhead to come out of that
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0139938_0140207	nei no you've got to click off to calculate it again
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0198494_0199206	you'd pay you'd pay a lot extra because it's individually being uh plastic was being made for you
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0083007_0083114	because of the backup is
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0102561_0102690	yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0171714_0172027	it's not like people trying to cut each other
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0166692_0166948	we've done room for creativity haven't we
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0121644_0122034	um we've got plastic and rubber haven't we
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0181444_0181597	yeah that was quite fun
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0098073_0098582	so how do we feel about this
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0168915_0169188	um did you feel like a team
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0138224_0138383	that will be got it slightly down
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0010200_0010830	the d uh do you wanna do you wanna sh do you wanna hold it and i'll i'll show you the presentation
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0096383_0096845	and if you didn't hear it in the room you're standing in then you realise it won't in that room you've gone into another room
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0027464_0027593	uh that would be too complicated
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0014453_0015093	and we'll first look at the exterior of what we've uh come up with over there
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0159145_0159456	the point zero one of a euro
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0010605_0010822	yeah uh so
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0069892_0070123	oh sorry i i got it wrong
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0210623_0210881	but i think but you were saying that that's quite
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0027532_0028157	uh yeah if it was getting that c i well that that could be something for the next time maybe
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0157223_0157350	uh yeah we're close to the budget
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0163418_0163680	we don't need something else to take that place
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0124069_0124247	what does it mean if you put point five for that
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0119933_0120168	just be a flat bottom with one curve on top that
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0120548_0120704	yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0138626_0139126	so it is is uncurved completely and just actually making the rubber case the curved thing is that's going to make a difference
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0143373_0143511	and going into a regular battery
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0151710_0152186	if we w if we're working to head off this specification is this is what's project team's working for
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0086708_0087178	just sitting like that we found some many people did how do you minimise that on such a small device
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0083938_0084046	yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0021771_0022666	and working on the inside with um d already said decided on the kinetic batteries which actually
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0118949_0119083	nee
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0106722_0107058	you're gonna plug this in so you can all see it if that's okay
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0116133_0116678	yeah it's you you've put in three for the number of kinetic cells there should just be one
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0068777_0068895	okay
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0172027_0172218	it's more of a three cosy t. v. book
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0185103_0185350	um like the whole picture of the thing
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0180250_0180551	but that's nothing to do with the teamwork at all
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0023993_0024362	um we decided that um the voice recognition system
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0092947_0093561	and we talked about voice recognition we talked about a beeper have we really of the designers come to any dec real decision on that
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0213994_0214279	let's it's is this company going on here
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0033648_0034164	the button so when it's even if it's open here the signals would go out
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0119481_0119693	but it has a slightly flat bottom so it can sit
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0170117_0170307	find out from each other yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0213317_0213646	to shape it won't ever get me
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0185416_0185717	yeah but didn't like moving around the room
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0221151_0221379	but do we not sometimes evaluate in these meetings too
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0116802_0117113	in the top it's the number of so yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0049116_0049991	the criteria that we'd want in this remote control are a fancy look and feel technical innovation it should be easy to use
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0120464_0120574	one double curved
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0142112_0142400	okay so the highest we've got is the electronics here
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0090814_0090958	oh a five okay
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0192020_0192299	and as sh as what sorry you go
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0181283_0181419	the fake r. c. s
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0114834_0115187	it was regular chip on print and
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0210559_0210707	maybe fifty percent more
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0004997_0005194	we wanted a stand by function
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0128938_0129220	then we don't stop on anyone's toes
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0041343_0041510	thank you very much
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0169703_0169821	it think we heard an nice sign
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0081046_0082045	but the changeable faci visitors would uh allow you to get any basically any one of a number of colours it that it's full sort of customer
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0204806_0205290	and you can't get you've got your hands at that works fine but you can't get the battery anymore for that type of phone
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0138203_0138312	why yes
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0042881_0043105	there you go
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0089572_0089900	it's quite obvious just big buttons
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0059099_0059204	and rating
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0024362_0024997	it did actually say on the email that they were sort of coming in and they were fairly easy to get hold of
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0139863_0140057	it's not calculated it
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0205778_0205904	it's not that much
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0195953_0196277	they're trying to shift the d. v. d. player the video player the t. v.
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0146444_0146567	where's the voice recognition
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0142988_0143645	if we moved away from our much lost idea of a kinetic battery and just went with the standard batteries would that make a huge difference
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0177869_0178399	you know you it didn't matter saying what you thought because if it wasn't something that was that relevant
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0173464_0173955	yeah no i thought it it won't really well and i yeah i
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0009949_0010093	yeah shall i show
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0194929_0195222	can't you get the one that we used for the last one
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0090559_0090965	yeah i d i'd f i'd go for a five actually 'cause
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0055241_0055377	so we're going to look at these criteria
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0091194_0091503	four and a four okay
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0068080_0068370	and i would give that a three
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0101757_0101958	or do we have to make further modifications
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0057436_0057767	se. d. e. f to confuse it with the number rating
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0201118_0201302	like solar is selling of everything
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0152186_0152756	we can put in our recommendations for what we've we've found and what we the consensus that we've come to is the result of the meetings
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0182059_0182550	how do we evaluate the materials we had for communicating and sharing information
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0165733_0165921	alright so we've done that
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0158747_0158964	are they going to really clip about ten p.
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0191831_0191944	absolutely yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0149976_0150154	yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0156026_0156347	it's it's some completely different associated with your company
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0204421_0204579	but focusing it on to people yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0144939_0145209	but shape and colours that something we shouldn't compare
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0056716_0056932	right
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0098582_0099508	we've got our we've got the highest rating of meeting the specifications that is definitely true for two of the uh six criteria there
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0215890_0216450	so i'll be delegating in my um role as project supervisor so good luck
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0067192_0067463	two point seven five there we go
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0061753_0062147	criteria a. the fancy look and feel
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0181597_0182055	um means whiteboard digital pens etcetera what does that mean
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0127840_0128124	okay we'll just put it in as we'll put it in as half
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0086309_0086708	we talked about pointers but the very use of a remote control if you're someone who zapping
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0041653_0041912	raping it all up okay
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0199681_0200613	supplementary thing is like uh people give a lot of attention to mobile phones like every f month you see a new launch or something like that
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0219181_0219500	think i think i've got minutes for two of the meetings and uh
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0113995_0114217	um it might have implications our choice
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0095602_0096244	uh think it would probably be a a standard it would be a standard it would be quite loud
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0156794_0157060	then i'll do it
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0158628_0158747	oh i
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0062147_0062660	how do we feel about this prototype model relating to fancy it is a fancy look and feel
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0196984_0197713	mean if you could have something that's a proper funky thing a funky item that's individual individual to you
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0120288_0120438	so just one double
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0206460_0206619	there we go
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0101119_0101757	do we feel on the basis of tha of these evaluation findings that we can go ahead and now produce this as a prototype in market it
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0143648_0144016	yeah the standard uh th um it would make one difference
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0032552_0032972	just at the front of the we haven't i don't think we actually put it on
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0141065_0141279	it could be in dollars
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0091965_0092202	so that's four point two five
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0127484_0127676	so do we not have to account for the costs somewhere there
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0040004_0040229	now d not not actually
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0158669_0158815	twenty five that's not
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0002393_0002526	and three apparently
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0121063_0121404	the other curves are the sides but it's slightly flattened at the bottom so it doesn't roll over
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0211119_0211269	uh think we've done what we're required to do
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0065609_0066132	adding those up we've got six and a five eleven divided by four is what
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0052504_0052880	okay so we can come back to that slide if you don't have a note of those
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0077443_0077562	okay
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0105464_0105590	it's
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0166203_0166372	okay
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0059086_0059303	beep or uh it's a light maybe it's a light
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0053853_0054232	okay friendly shape that would help
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0058148_0058588	yeah maybe it should have a light so that we can we can just recognise where it is
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0040381_0041267	so these are all things of course to remember with the budget and when you design to materials cost et cetera
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0011307_0011817	so why don't we look at the presentation uh to see what we really are supposed to do
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0050378_0050675	well you know what's if we get a really good designer maybe we can do that
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0016519_0016699	so maybe you're gonna make some notes of that
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0025468_0025736	okay
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0029006_0029219	so that it will record okay
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0074525_0074986	we have to justify that price by having sufficient features to make it sell at that price
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0011875_0011991	um
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0024394_0024545	it can't right this thing
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0030798_0031573	very bad cat
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0032258_0032750	would you like th like just to see um how it feels so that you have a little idea
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0026002_0026470	then tool training retro out the white board permanent control their favourite animal
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0048137_0048262	oh what do you feel
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0065819_0066177	but it could be someplace really obvious and you still wouldn't be able to find it
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0041916_0042758	now uh the discussion i guess is um does any one of you have experience with remote control
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0034707_0034831	it's not okay
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0027758_0027986	whether you without hanging yourself
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0057264_0057676	uh so so it should either beep or uh a light should blink
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0060957_0061646	in anyway if it's like in a dark spot uh meaning you're like new papers on top
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0019744_0020164	here is what the functional design is supposed to achieve
AMI_IS1009a_H01_FIO087_0052326_0052544	all the almost all the remotes
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0035592_0035998	oh my god
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0052783_0053265	yeah maybe thin a little col yeah colours and shapes also
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0066398_0066528	yeah of course that then
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0077780_0078716	think basically basically you will get instructions to work with and if you have any questions uh uh i guess you can uh
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0037725_0038609	uh profit aim for the company is fifty million euro the market range unlimited meaning international
AMI_IS1009a_H01_FIO087_0006739_0006909	yeah my name is francis now
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0019638_0019744	alright
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0071171_0071568	uh working design yeah it's it's uh mainly technical functional design
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0057201_0057472	yeah some beep or something like that so that we can go
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0079650_0079774	alright well uh
AMI_IS1009a_H01_FIO087_0047276_0047914	like uh the remote control which we use for t. v. it should uh it should be used f uh for some other purpose also
AMI_IS1009a_H01_FIO087_0033158_0033336	now okay
AMI_IS1009a_H01_FIO087_0052105_0052326	yeah design should be yeah it should be different
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0079125_0079260	yeah even a half
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0067777_0067999	you know well maybe we have to move along okay
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0031573_0031812	and it likes to sit like that
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0075610_0075784	uh think that's the end of the show
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0066770_0067159	oh yeah well uh but then those people we can't help everybody
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0079163_0079283	how about you people
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0063003_0063476	it c has a centre and it gives out a signal whether that be a light signal or a beep
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0075138_0075610	and you know pep you you will get specific um instructions for that
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0056602_0056712	so some
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0044399_0044923	things you would like to change things you would like to improve with this thing any first ideas
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0028008_0028551	see if i remember how to draw a kitty cat or a rabbit or something
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0027623_0027852	okay i'll see what i can do
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0033357_0033549	uh don't know uh get to that later
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0071725_0071875	yeah function design and use
AMI_IS1009a_H01_FIO087_0046146_0046571	yes i i feel that all the remote should be very compact
AMI_IS1009a_H01_FIO087_0053067_0053246	uh the different shapes
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0072439_0073430	and the marketing manager is coming up with some user requirement specification like friendliness and what we just discussed in n general
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0021157_0021820	the same goes for the c conceptual design there will be individual work which and then discussion afterwards
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0028810_0029082	and remember you have to press so it works
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0064224_0065078	you know that would be right you have to have some kind of sensor and i i think uh voice or clapping that's not specific enough
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0035999_0036482	hope the kiddie cat is hungry 'cause i don't like snakes
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0032877_0033282	and i suppose to wipe off that or okay
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0025279_0025469	after we finish the remote control we'll get to that
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0040286_0040648	um is fifty
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0015754_0016232	uh should be original trendy and of course user friendly
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0067808_0068395	okay we have um yeah we have to move a long but i think we have some good good points to start with here
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0065078_0065848	uh i know there are the lamps and stuff you know you can clap on and off but i think they only work to certain degree and
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0073594_0073824	and of course price
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0060567_0060957	okay my my idea is maybe that the minute it's really hidden
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0012611_0013238	the tools uh i think we already i guess the tool is really our the computer as far as i can see
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0051311_0051812	it should be something new it should be s it should do something different than then just what we have
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0049278_0049524	yeah
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0072011_0072439	so you have a working design and then a functional design
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0013804_0014097	project plan that falls under the same heading pretty much
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0055123_0055827	that is true because they put a news paper or they put it behind a plant or we know whatever
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0070746_0071113	so we're looking for a working design when we come back
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0042869_0043119	yeah of course use in remote control
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0053345_0053873	um so yeah shapes right you know like kinetic shaped feels better in your hand or something you know
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0008533_0008694	uh i wanna figure out how to sell them
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0054232_0055025	think another thing that would help is um if it beeps one you clap because i think one of the big things that happens is people lose them
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0011071_0011307	and i'm the project manager for today
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0027468_0027612	you wanna go i'll lean and
AMI_IS1009a_H01_FIO087_0035586_0035895	how does it look like
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0062575_0063003	in in that moment it has a sensor i it it gets a certain darkness
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0066689_0066793	because people are still
AMI_IS1009a_H01_FIO087_0007661_0008083	and my role is to design uh a television remote control
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0069545_0070163	uh the working design i guess that's the function i. d. uh who is this
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0079652_0079781	oh so let's see
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0063909_0064125	so the light sensor would activate the signal
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0032052_0032258	and you're front seat right
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0039523_0039851	oh can that should keep everybody on their toes and charged
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0066522_0066689	well because you're because you're silly
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0069212_0069545	okay so we'll you'll got the news um
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0048170_0048273	what do you p
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0070163_0070398	the industrial designer that's you
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0023611_0023838	experienced
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0010851_0011071	and as you already know i'm battery
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0057471_0057593	so if lost
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0048672_0049526	so it should be a multi functional uh gadget that would um control all your household uh uh machines basically
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0053809_0053924	yeah
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0026470_0026872	does anybody w want to go and s see how the white board works
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0005586_0005769	everybody ready
AMI_IS1009a_H01_FIO087_0057858_0058016	uh flores in signal yeah
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0043656_0044399	now having used a remote control for years does anybody already have like an idea like things you didn't like with it
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0073430_0073594	that would be your idea
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0077087_0077357	um any questions at this point
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0021944_0022212	detail design same thing basically
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0080194_0080361	and see if what we can come up with
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0066611_0066715	because it because i can't
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0066866_0067777	mean it could be on well i if we're like on top of your book case and you usually kept it on the coffee table um
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0049614_0050276	um twelve fifty euros per
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0055827_0056564	and and they uh the only the phone rings and they wanted to turn the t. v. off and this is my remote control yeah
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0073824_0074169	that it that it that the price is a good price
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0020378_0021157	that is it's gonna be individual work and then at the meeting we'll we'll discuss what uh we have come up with
AMI_IS1009a_H01_FIO087_0046571_0046979	yeah those which we get here nowadays it's very long
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0051812_0052107	now of course the other thing to think there is maybe the design
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0063476_0063721	but i mean that we can discuss that later you know
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0068849_0069212	uh think you all did you get uh notices on your computer for this
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0057674_0058145	if lost uh signal with b throw signal you know
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0022046_0022155	okay so
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0022276_0022645	three different types of design that we're gonna be concerned with okay
AMI_IS1009a_H01_FIO087_0033747_0033963	that should it
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0071572_0072011	and then the technical function you're the technical function so so you're the working design
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0024948_0025270	yes
AMI_IS1009a_H01_FIO087_0006909_0007661	and i'm uh an user interface my role is uh the f main responsibilities user interface
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0079796_0080194	then uh we see you in about thirty minutes
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0061646_0062032	that's better is on top or it's it's behind the plant
AMI_IS1009a_H01_FIO087_0080408_0080526	okay okay
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0036725_0037272	here's a project finance uh which of course we all have to think about when we design this thing
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0008339_0008533	and i'm a marketing person
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0068207_0068311	yeah a good point
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0052422_0052829	like trend you know like f earlier we saw maybe it should be something trendy you know
AMI_IS1009a_H01_FIO087_0047914_0048673	like controlling the um uh temperature inside the house or for air conditioning or for heating system
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0038740_0039364	and production cost should not exceed hopefully should be less than twelve fifty euro
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0042895_0043324	exa 'cause we we use 'em we use 'em right everyday
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0006200_0006547	and uh with name and what your function is
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0037272_0037593	um selling price is supposed to be twenty five euro
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0029219_0029775	um um traditional keyboard
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0074169_0074465	and the price is given but uh that was
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0077357_0077595	or uh suggestions
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0058790_0059260	um i'm just saying through signal meaning just whether it's a beep or rather a light or
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0052829_0053345	maybe you should different colours or materials or you know
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0014944_0015168	here is what this thing should be
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0024101_0024250	um
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0050780_0051357	but we certainly can try to i agree with her that to market something successfully it should do some more things
AMI_IS1009a_H01_FIO087_0046979_0047276	and um and it should have multi purpose
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0058567_0058790	exactly i mean just uh that's what i say
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0024812_0025104	maybe we should redesign it
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0006154_0006257	yeah that's a good plan
AMI_IS1009a_H01_FIO087_0032223_0032416	yes i'm panic now
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0055567_0055672	yeah
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0006547_0006729	so maybe i miss it with you
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0012134_0012611	uh yes it opening acquaintance to training well
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0030752_0031064	oh that's a fat cat
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0045986_0046137	yeah
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0005769_0006085	uh i think the first thing we do is introduce ourselves
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0078758_0079163	okay i think i have enough to think about till our next meeting
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0079260_0079395	yeah even then i have i think yeah
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0070461_0070773	yeah it's functional yeah exactly the technical
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0015168_0015754	the thing we're gonna um uh design uh is a new remote control
AMI_IS1009a_H01_FIO087_0034799_0034978	and i'm going to draw a stick
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0014097_0014616	um i don't think we have any great discussion at this point
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0068584_0068849	okay the next meeting will be in thirty minutes
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0062032_0062575	at that moment it's it's like it's like um what you call it the lights uh sensors you know
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0043324_0043499	and um
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0026872_0027252	so that case we have to in the next meeting present something on the white board
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0056614_0057317	well or yeah or if it's really if it's really a dark spot that it gives out uh a a sound or a signal
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0013287_0013804	uh we get ins each of us will get instructions and we'll take it from there
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0063430_0063763	yeah probably we yeah probably that's the later yeah yeah
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0046515_0046621	small right
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0076472_0077087	so um we have well we have a p nine two two three minutes
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0111519_0111649	uh holder remote control
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0137802_0138030	and an alarm clock yeah that should that should be okay
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0097752_0098520	and it's and it's the kind of thing people learn by feel and um uh you don't feel the mood change
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0173347_0173463	exactly
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0026131_0026563	so we're coming to you for how much is it gonna cost and how long is it gonna take you
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0060994_0061373	and i'm going to talk about the working design of the remote control
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0098176_0098450	yeah yeah you you don't uh use y yeah
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0030625_0031175	so i'd like your suggestions to come back to the other slide where i was saying we could suggest anything
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0186120_0186575	and in that case we could probably moulded plastic isn't all that expensive is it
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0081515_0081690	and there should be a child lock
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0010963_0011958	okay well i think we have introduced ourselves so the functional requirements uh uh is m is part of my goal but wanna pass right to the second slide
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0155734_0156064	so these are the two things we should come up with with
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0121442_0122422	as a user interface designer i did a little research to find out what the features which uh user would like to have on their remote
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0147988_0148961	and if a person if if if parents wants the television to be switched off by ten o'clock then it should be switched off ten eq at ten o'clock automatically
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0060245_0060521	the cup cap shape yeah
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0076111_0076315	so can you go to the next slide please
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0112286_0112464	um next slide please
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0155070_0155734	and uh what function working design how how does it work
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0110652_0111183	you know different shapes or whatever it is that should be a case to put to give a shape
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0143608_0144513	so uh the d you have different uh types of remotes with different light sources which i use which can be used for controlling the different functionalities of a television
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0055696_0055895	okay that's uh about it for me right now
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0009559_0009705	your participant four
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0165367_0166225	whether that different shape also includes maybe different uh buttons uh for different groups
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0087557_0088267	do you think there's any chance of um having so uh having basically the same mission with the same buttons but maybe several different shapes
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0038308_0038440	okay so that's something
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0157798_0158314	yeah and i think today there are probably not many people who don't have a t. v.
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0170623_0170867	it do we look at one target group
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0085488_0085806	yeah yeah yeah and colours also different colours and
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0185216_0185658	or we have to try to use the same electronics and make three different shapes
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0197756_0197905	warning finish meeting now
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0022406_0022828	so it's gotta be really attractive and it but it's got to go to market by supplement
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0107578_0107880	whatever the t. v. is on remote control will have a light
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0120107_0120208	yes two
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0185947_0186082	the plastic case
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0096845_0096954	um
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0121071_0121245	would you want it full full screen
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0040704_0041353	so i just wanted to into check this here so we're not getting too much off track here with uh with the things we wanna look at
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0109143_0109521	chip which is like a brain to the remote control which does all the operations
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0127901_0128111	on the on on the remote
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0105851_0106265	then uh the remote control should automatically have a b s light
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0019778_0020047	so that was um what i meant there
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0160519_0160975	so i think that's uh one group that's certainly important
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0020047_0020887	and as i said it on the slide they're consulting the industrial engineer about that and the other thing is time is really gonna be as important as money
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0066643_0067027	uh a remote control is specifically designed to a single device
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0154275_0155070	however uh the decision we have to take in this meeting is who is our target group
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0089635_0089884	yeah for children
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0026563_0027101	and i'll be coming to you to tell me what's gonna make somebody take out their wallet you know
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0014672_0015069	you can say anything you want anyway how silly it sounds you know it should run your car
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0085700_0085982	and that you s you say that that won't add too much to the budget
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0083182_0084080	if uh make it useable for more than one device it's uh it's hard but i think it's possible but it uh yeah yeah yeah so it's it's it's okay
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0103559_0103774	yeah that that's good the clock is good
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0040221_0040704	and that there's no mistake that it could be somebody else who is bringing this out
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0104880_0105030	and uh bulbs
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0089813_0089969	like a dial or
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0052895_0053566	so i gotta concentrate on the features that help you find it and i've already said this several times but i put it down in writing here
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0007539_0007703	okay you want me to start right now
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0106384_0106796	then it will be like if you switch on your t. v. through another uh another source
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0149547_0149771	yeah and then you can use a timer as well
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0114975_0115139	the oh no
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0086928_0087468	is the budget we're looking at if you built one more that don't think that's gonna make a big difference since it's gonna be square or
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0097647_0097780	yeah yeah
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0109521_0110074	and wires connecting all chips which is uh lights everything so there should be wires
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0007998_0008644	well could you um put my slides up because i think it might be helpful if uh we looked at the slides at the same time
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0029054_0029206	okay can we go the next slide please
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0085300_0085700	yeah that's good for the marketing point of view the fun the fun shape
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0187816_0188477	so you can have a stripped one or you can have a flores and blue one or whatever and maybe something like that
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0179728_0179872	it doesn't doesn't matter
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0047965_0048737	okay so my personal preferences in this um project are we really have to concentrate on the size
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0162455_0163223	mean that's a question um whether that's important that children can really use it or not
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0027570_0027685	the signal signal
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0111613_0111738	folder yeah mm-hmm
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0081211_0081515	it there can be no action taken to that so
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0086437_0086748	it just build the old basically and uh you know
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0044093_0044900	and that was thirty four percent of even more important the thing that we did address in our last meeting that frequently it's lost somewhere in the room
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0057335_0057454	yeah yeah sure
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0103757_0103939	oh okay
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0169322_0170178	you know like you make it nice some pink flores and banana colour or whatever you know yeah for example you know
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0156064_0156654	so uh the first thing is pro maybe a little easier on the who is our target group
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0179295_0179446	now it it doesn't cost you
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0148961_0149228	so that nobody else comes later and use it
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0197287_0197556	five minutes that was i guess that that's the old message
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0096316_0096672	changing modes is nothing for us but people who
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0139914_0140886	and uh the the design of the um um remotes should be in such a way that they should not be any sharp projections so that if a child plays with a remote
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0102808_0103154	yeah you're sitting there already maybe you have no other uh
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0088504_0088682	because that might help with the marketing
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0201207_0201447	so now i understand it's lunch break
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0102753_0103119	yeah and then you can just see your remote control yeah yeah so
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0061832_0062592	the method is like uh in a remote control you have a chip integrated circuit which is like a brain of the remote controller
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0176300_0177029	but in a family in a family they will be a aged person children and a middle aged but they cannot buy three different remotes
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0053566_0053911	should be an attractive import at twenty five euros
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0198668_0198931	yeah maybe yeah yeah
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0120040_0120160	you are not supposed to
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0085982_0086172	the d the shape is uh
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0145632_0146151	and these are my f uh few personal f preferences like it can be used for a multi purpose use
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0104056_0104880	uh components uh the main components we need for uh it are like buttons and the uh uh underneath that there should be switch
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0013030_0013619	um i thought that the method i should follow would be gather suggestions from everybody
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0034686_0035355	um we have received instruction from higher up that certain things should not be uh considered
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0096935_0097875	and it's a small button and and they they don't press it exactly you know something else happens n not their favourite channel comes up but something else and they're very frustrated you know
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0084080_0084245	yeah yeah
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0050250_0050983	you've got to make it attractive enough so they buy it now now now now is a big word in i in my book for selling this thing
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0061373_0061644	um can you go to the next slide please
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0157482_0157685	yeah who has a t. v. yeah
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0159520_0160519	we have we have earlier it was mentioned about um for example elderly people who have limited function with their fingers in hands
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0090440_0091106	and uh the button buttons also i think if you want to have more features in your remote control then there should be more buttons
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0173074_0173490	out of the cost we are supposed to reject
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0083710_0083926	well we already eliminated that
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0177578_0177728	yeah of course that we can do
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0168847_0169322	uh think the children issue can be addressed with the shape and with colours
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0043738_0044093	just a little of them take too much time to learn how to use
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0137124_0137523	and i don't think it will cost much to set an alarm clock inside a remote
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0198892_0199452	but i think i th i think to sum it up the target group is basically everybody
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0018921_0019778	and then the things that seem the most attractive th that to uh to a customer will try to then prioritise those
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0091748_0092561	so i think uh we need to make some buttons which are which are like um uh f uh in uh intended for two or three operations
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0137642_0137890	if there is a clock then there can be a a lot of clock
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0153384_0154275	well my slide show basically we already we have already done the agenda and uh on the closing uh basically there would be lunch break and all that
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0009682_0009830	um for example four i believe
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0039112_0039508	and that the corporate colour and design are being used on the product
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0070147_0070757	and the t. v. it should translate that into like change the channel or something like that
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0173587_0173696	okay
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0034130_0034686	okay can can i at this point induce um something
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0038285_0039112	um and the and the third thing that they wanna make sure um that they're that the corporate image is being maintained
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0003732_0003865	okay it's everybody ready
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0059376_0059594	oh can you make it a full screen please
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0111068_0111184	to keep the remote
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0042838_0043738	um alright now uh other things that i found out on in my research is that the complaints that people have about the remote controls are out there now
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0044900_0045388	um so those are two things that we definitely do want to address
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0088300_0088570	yeah that is also possible i yeah i uh yeah
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0163447_0163714	so this these are just some thoughts i have on it
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0141528_0142412	and findings uh i found out uh y um in different sites that uh there are different remotes which can be used
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0122422_0122697	uh yeah can you please go on to the next side
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0194615_0194841	well i think we can only afford so
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0089733_0089875	like an animal or
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0021364_0021801	twenty five euros makes a nice little present and we want it to be an impulse purpose
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0071650_0072292	yeah well that's already been eliminated by management so we're off the hook
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0199939_0200079	okay
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0158170_0158348	don't take t. v. yeah
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0190507_0190650	you know yes
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0157093_0157263	and i guess in many ways everybody
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0157448_0157621	everybody who has a t. v.
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0103710_0103811	yeah
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0180380_0181272	and i think the how will it function is probably the question of the buttons you know within the target group or sub groups
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0114021_0114147	it that it's from me now
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0017633_0018011	it takes five years to develop this it's just something we can't do
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0103293_0103559	and you have to go somewhere but you just wanna look at the news for a minute
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0102313_0102440	yeah because it's the last
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0049802_0050107	if somebody says oh i'll come back and get it next week you're dead
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0106796_0107456	now from through a remote c remote control and you you lost your remote control maybe you can find it with the light
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0130658_0131316	then the parents can lock that particular channel so that the ch children cannot view that channel
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0041353_0041995	these were instructions from higher up so we have to eliminate uh these things so it's only gonna be t. v.
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0158314_0158496	they are a few but in general not
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0098520_0099118	so um maybe having buttons be very shapes might be helpful too
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0140886_0141138	he uh he should not be harmed in any way
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0182431_0183428	but the question is how much will that set us back if let's say uh forty percent we make large buttons and the rest we make regular buttons for example
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0186847_0187426	well maybe there's there's an idea uh you know t the new for example new portable phones
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0073653_0073867	so uh you can control whatever you want
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0102692_0102808	yes
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0054921_0055696	um and then maybe a motto like we put fashion in electronics might be something we can use in our marketing campaign
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0186661_0186947	oh i i i don't think no well maybe this
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0095879_0096045	yeah it's like you know yeah
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0041995_0042510	but the one thing maybe that could be um eliminated is the teletext uh idea
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0196111_0197066	um having maybe larger buttons or buttons that light up or buttons that are slightly differently shaped for people uh either for children um
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0045388_0046099	oh we wanna s make it as simple as possible we wanna make it um obvious and intuitive to use
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0179221_0179323	cost effective
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0057229_0057449	you want me to get your slide show up
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0134353_0134816	and uh and uh and uh there's one more point which i noted it down
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0201778_0201922	so that's what we will do
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0160975_0161845	um then we have just the newest people who can never press a little button on anything um unless it's really very clear
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0052603_0052895	finding it's important obviously you can't use it if you can't find it
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0132383_0133347	uh the remote should be compact and it should na it should have as many buttons as possible for controlling different functionalities of the t. v. television
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0117636_0117926	uh it's actually there in uh that on the screen
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0181272_0182218	the question is only whether our budget will allow to have more than one design in a sense
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0137830_0138232	yes and as j. and we said the buttons can be uh
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0157657_0157792	t. v. television users
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0100076_0100251	but we'll get to that with you
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0088531_0089146	uh i think uh i think we will have to look at the budget on that but i think in principle that that would be that would be that would be a kind of fun
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0020887_0021322	because if we're gonna sell this thing i think the best time to sell it is is a crisp present
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0185658_0186120	um the same electronics and basically all that's gonna be different is the plastic case
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0147193_0147988	and then to save electricity uh there should not be uh much s m uh lots of circuits and all that
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0198506_0198918	well we may have to come back to one or two of these points at our next meeting but um
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0051832_0052603	we have to have as few buttons as possible because more buttons is more confusion so that's what i'm saying simplicity is good
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0010629_0010753	oh okay okay
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0197944_0198241	um um
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0121146_0121371	yes yes yes yes
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0071692_0072250	yeah and it's yeah b so we ha
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0179808_0179911	uh d i wouldn't think so
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0060771_0060994	yeah exac uh so to do
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0059841_0060125	now it's like a well you have to press here
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0102143_0102905	yeah that's that's a good that's a good one because the clock could be really when when is your favourite show coming on and
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0166276_0166737	well you know there's the old motto children under six never stop alone
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0056599_0057157	who would be next uh i guess that would be you
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0105030_0105851	like uh we can have a bulb like whenever we are operating a remote controller or um whenever the t. v. is on suppose
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0185553_0185747	yeah well that's that's the question
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0018011_0018921	so in the beginning just have a big pile of things that we anybody can f throw anything in and then just weed things out that can be done for one reason or another
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0200145_0200247	do we agree to be
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0179132_0179323	that's not really gonna change much is it
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0115370_0116172	and i have recorded the page to get new ideas or like what can be the working design to how it works and all sorts
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0176298_0176399	well that's that's b
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0167876_0168847	uh that that has a lot of that has a lot of appeal but i think um i'm i'm talking about the functionality now on it whether we're looking at different groups
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0032924_0033501	at the budget that we're looking at and at the price point we're looking at we should be able to make it work the t. v. the v. c. r.
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0047160_0047734	and i think that those things after my research that we definitely wanna try to incorporate it
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0200825_0200991	yeah yeah of course yeah
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0158673_0159520	uh now talk about the target group which is in a sense everybody but i think within the target group we have sub groups
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0177029_0177625	they would like to buy just one and uh just one which can be used by all the three uh
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0036262_0037062	and according to uh higher management the it should only control the t. v.
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0119741_0119918	and for instance
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0091392_0091748	if you have less features than your remote control it won't be attractive
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0179020_0179123	but the second you know
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0107456_0107578	maybe we can have that
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0126978_0127965	now they should be some timer to set for using a particular uh particular programme according to the user choice
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0108668_0109143	and battery there should be a battery for power supply and a chip
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0149375_0149515	time yeah
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0086009_0086577	now no no it's w uh i don't think it will be like you can have you know for uh if you want it that that will
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0058082_0058319	and you are number three
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0012069_0012334	because that's where my discussion starts
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0049169_0049802	uh because once there's no beep back well in sales they always say you know beep backs don't come back
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0094930_0095705	because i think one of the things people were complaining about in my when i found out on my research is when they complained about how hard it is to learn a new one
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0176666_0176809	it can happen every little bit yeah
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0050107_0050250	they're never gonna come back and buy it
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0149124_0149678	the like the okay it's like a time and then yeah it's like a lock to the television
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0121036_0121146	you can make it full
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0095705_0096316	the changing modes was something i mean you and uh all four all four of us we work with computers all the time
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0070757_0071600	change the volume control and uh so uh i think it's hard to design a remote control for multiple uh devices
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0033501_0034381	the stereo set um maybe something else cute like a coffee pot or one other appliance or maybe a lamp
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0112017_0112192	yeah um okay you move on to the next
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0099118_0100076	you know like the a triangle is for the volume and a square is for changing channels so that people can uh uh develop a tactical sense of it
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0089884_0090028	yeah that's what yeah
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0021801_0022222	we want somebody to see it and think it's j i just gotta have that
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0169762_0169980	you can make a banana shaped one
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0103084_0103293	yeah a lot of time there's not a clock on the screen
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0184362_0185216	that's alright and can we can we is it even feasible to make one one remote control with something for everyone
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0003972_0004279	yeah i just put it on my microphone here and it'll be right with you
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0089549_0089661	simply for children
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0150288_0150602	okay now i have
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0139184_0139773	so in even in the dark the user can know what buttons to use to switch on a particular channel
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0117284_0117607	could you go back to that slide where she had that uh s slide up betsy
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0022222_0022406	and take out their wallet and buy it
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0099002_0099208	yeah shapes also different shapes
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0037439_0037582	it is the yeah o cause
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0092561_0093299	like if you press one button in one mode then it will change the channel if you press the other button in another mode it will change the colour
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0066293_0066601	like a t. v. or a air conditioner something like that so
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0202220_0202324	so thank you very much
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0183533_0184353	so that remains to s to be seen but uh the target group as a whole is is basically everybody is a t. v.
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0200474_0201028	do we agree on on that in principle like money will tell whether we will be able to do that or not
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0093299_0093901	so if you want to have less buttons we can have that option but i think it will complicate the matter more i think so
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0108020_0108277	and then uh in flores
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0058247_0058379	number two
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0138232_0139184	it can m uh we can use the flores to light up up the buttons so different uh buttons will glow differently
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0161845_0162455	and uh i don't know how much we want to cater to children's use
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0054476_0054921	has to be so great that they're gonna say oh twenty five euros isn't much
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0031175_0031708	it like the suggestions to be really specific so that we'll have a list of things we can cross off
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0201029_0201159	okay fair enough
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0190462_0191133	yeah like for mobile phones we have uh different you know covers like design and all so like we can have another
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0197828_0197944	finish meeting now
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0047734_0047873	okay can we go to the next slide please
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0190982_0191694	and but like if if then everybody is is is tired of the flores and blue and of the stripe to whatever they have as another one in the package
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0111410_0111519	uh case holder
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0116205_0116375	so it might be helpful if we had a look at that
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0179406_0179688	that that that will that won't change much will it uh
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0137491_0137642	yeah show
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0010847_0010963	there we go
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0186575_0186754	um you're an industrial person
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0053911_0054476	so it has to have an value that when somebody looks at it this uh twenty five euros i'm not gonna take that
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0039508_0040221	so that it's easy that that that uh that can be easily identified as a product of of of the company
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0133347_0134209	and uh b uh as uh this is my personal preference that it should be in the shape of a t. and elaborate for more compactability
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0170178_0170467	but the question is really who is our target group
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0190040_0190371	and then if people really want more colours they can buy it separately
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0110167_0110652	and o uh of course there should be a case where we can keep all the things and
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0115161_0115274	well you don't have to
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0179785_0180380	uh the the question the question to be addressed here is only who is the target group and how will it function
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0048737_0049169	that is the selling point the thing that's gonna make it an import process
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0198931_0199144	think if we do some more research maybe we'll take some more
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0179007_0179132	what about the electronics
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0108277_0108576	um uh this is like a b when it is dark
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0086683_0086926	it's it's just a s shape so it doesn't matter
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0102284_0102486	oh-huh oh-huh
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0006079_0006733	uh think the marketing manager probably should go first addressing the needs and desires
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0056303_0056460	and uh
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0035355_0036262	um the one thing for example something to eliminate maybe that the teletext because that's sort of outdated with the internet
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0100079_0100646	yeah yeah and also text should be very clear so that there there won't be any ambiguities that uh
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0128951_0129389	and the t. v. will automatically it will switch on and that particular time
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0131316_0132153	and uh the uh the b uh and the one of the feature a user would like to have is the compactness of the co remote
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0091106_0091392	if there are more buttons than it will be more complicated
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0010096_0010373	okay and now i can uh full screen
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0083585_0084194	yeah well yeah well that has been uh that has been eliminated so that's that's unfortunately a mute point now
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0149432_0149547	diminum
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0128388_0128951	so if if we want to view a particular programme at say nine o'clock he can set the time
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0202439_0202690	and we'll see after lunch
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0188725_0188880	oh there's a real idea yeah
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0114715_0115075	so uh we should visit this site and have a look at uh what's up there
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0175767_0176417	we can design different remotes for different people like for aged people they will be big buttons and you know uh
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0042700_0042838	alright thanks for that
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0102808_0102940	the yes
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0022828_0023485	because anything that you don't have already out there in supplement showing it around isn't gonna sell for christmas
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0012334_0013030	alright well um since i'm in charge of trying to figure out what we should put on this thing since i have to try to sell it
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0090210_0090371	yeah exactly
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0130485_0130598	by your child
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0103811_0104056	uh can you go to the next slide please
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0096671_0096935	yeah a little elderly a little artistic hand you know
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0146201_0147193	uh no uh like it can it can be used as a t. v. control as plus an alarm clock to set an alarm a timer and it should have a child lock
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0199452_0200023	if money permits we can adjust some features for some sub groups within that
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0187426_0187816	they have like removable cases
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0051054_0051832	and in order to make it really sellable we've gotta shorten the learning curve make sure it's really intuitive and easy to use
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0172297_0172966	sort of sub groups with maybe different buttons for each group how much would that throw us
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0200029_0200753	um yeah i think maybe seventy percent is a unique c uh remote control and thirty percent is yeah yeah right yeah
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0182218_0182431	and the basic design i understand will be the same
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0027101_0027851	what what's what's gonna really be what they call a signal 'cause we gotta sell the signal
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0094196_0094311	yeah yeah yeah
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0103896_0104247	like uh you have got a signal by pressing a button
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0065632_0065748	you don't know me
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0016141_0016636	therefore messages uh will be controlled in the same manner
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0016636_0017055	there should be extra features like lit buttons maybe a beep
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0143144_0143839	they don't want to have to squat at small print um they want buttons who functions are obvious
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0136326_0136783	now nobody uses it because you nee you need a c a ca sophisticated chip and all
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0165479_0165739	the design concept and strong
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0146250_0146840	so that we have a leg up on time to sell it and push it before other people get out their christmas item
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0116236_0116386	can you go go onto the next
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0036777_0037125	like you can have the numbers one two three four up to nine
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0035170_0035689	now the function of a remote is to send messages to the television
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0163036_0163363	oh i think i think battery and i think we all agree on that
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0123781_0123904	they they are the circuits
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0096094_0096748	so in that way we can cut cut the cost but w uh yeah that we have to make the battery as rechargeable one
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0082974_0083549	even if you just uh b uh you know if you p if it falls down then it doesn't break
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0144676_0144923	it's got a look cute it's got a look appealing
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0052811_0053586	so the t. v. will have some recogniser which will recognise the users voice and accordingly it will change its functionality
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0124113_0125076	and um like uh we have uh designed uh before we have seen some uh things like instead of buttons we had some scrolls
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0113892_0114015	oh
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0162607_0162897	what kind of energy do we for see
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0075476_0075617	have to come back to that later
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0077830_0078010	uh the next one sorry
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0027908_0028452	uh are we all in agreement that that's about what we discussed last time
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0116197_0116303	uh-huh
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0072494_0072892	um what uh i'm no suggestion is bad
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0139591_0140222	so i've really been looking at the press and the ads that are out there for other remote controls
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0155631_0155945	so speech recognition is most important as far as you're concerned
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0083549_0083753	so it should be strong
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0028468_0028599	yeah i think it's pretty much as a
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0128993_0129358	uh yeah uh the product can be d uh delivered into different cases
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0133922_0134042	so for me now thank you
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0024093_0024326	and maybe have an ano alarm clock
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0088348_0088688	suppose if it is thirty eight degrees outside forty degree degrees outside
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0159844_0160229	and then you're expecting an answer from f for example you have a t. v. system
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0023009_0023561	potentially with maybe small children that they couldn't uh watch a channel that is unavailable
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0099792_0100604	and it will send some signals through the wires and then uh the chip will sends that connection and notes that which button is pressed
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0044193_0044767	then there should th uh there should be some buttons which can control features like the colour
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0146840_0147354	and we should develop one or two features we can really deal on in our edit campaign
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0143016_0143144	example is beautiful
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0060335_0061014	yeah now this is an interface for a child uh for a remote uh which a child can use
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0134648_0135275	uh yeah on the scroll and push button um ca you can increase scrolling by repeatedly pushing a button
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0169694_0169928	our speech recognition feature would be a supplement
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0051039_0051517	which can be recognised by as voice recogniser in the television for example
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0150324_0150982	they're more back into s soft feel spongy feeling things things with maybe a little flash on them
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0004927_0005625	uh first we're going uh over the minutes of the last meeting more or less
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0061664_0062022	and this comes with different colours different shapes
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0148872_0149481	and i've been looking around um at what designs every year different things are popular
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0143839_0144355	and they want um as few buttons as possible and they don't l care for the mute thing
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0149481_0149939	and in my research this year i found out that fruit and vegetable shapes are really popular
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0046472_0047301	especially if if if uh uh viewer he gets a telephone call and if he wants he doesn't want to switch off the uh t. v.
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0018493_0018818	you could see the time you know what show they want to watch
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0120132_0120531	tha though those prints will act as wires and so uh circuits
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0138383_0138486	okay
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0013079_0013750	um also mentioned was it should be uh it should have a very short learning curve
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0064779_0065694	now this is a big obliged remote which can not be misplaced or it's impossible to misplace
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0034196_0034711	how the remote looks like so that it is sellable it is attractive to customers
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0078760_0078872	the components design
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0114274_0114940	uh you can also see the uh b the green two green things are uh these uh they are they are resistors
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0168519_0168635	and
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0023683_0024093	for personal favourite it was it should be t shaped
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0131805_0132583	um and also for electronics we can use a simple and regular um r uh or an advanced chip on the print
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0130408_0130522	and you have more pictures
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0101397_0101770	it produ produces a more more scroll line signals specific to that button
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0119842_0120132	it's just printing something on a board
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0031419_0031552	oh come on it's close or so
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0138188_0138348	you're right to my first my next slide
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0104690_0105088	now that signal that morse code has to be amplified by the transmitter
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0055573_0056263	then these are some of the remotes which are different in shape and colour but they have many buttons
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0108100_0108406	so uh this is how the remote control works
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0025022_0025699	uh the different systems uh that exist are infrared or radio waves
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0041040_0041593	then you should have a button which should which ca which can be used for increasing or decreasing the volume
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0063815_0064076	attractive child interface
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0110176_0110781	and uh if you open the remote control you have this circuit circuit board and few electronic components
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0087957_0088348	and it should be consistent to high as well as uh low temperatures
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0097215_0097446	can you go to the next slide please
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0174301_0175288	in this phase the two of you yuan and france have to work together on a prototype using modelling clay it says here
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0029733_0029926	okay i can start first
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0141886_0142148	and i would encourage you all to do the same
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0118489_0119311	it's it's better to go for printing because uh you can build uh these kind of circuit boards on a on a bulb and it's just printing
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0123998_0124113	exactly
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0094162_0095016	uh if we will be able to make a res rechargeable battery then we sh we need not go for a high performance battery
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0067389_0067648	so this is one such interface which can be created
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0010556_0011343	in addition to that to make it sell of course uh the marketing manager wish is that it's be very attractive
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0152485_0153203	and what we really have to decide in this meeting is um the concept of the remote
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0155218_0155361	okay
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0059519_0059766	and this has embedded voice recogniser
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0140222_0140793	um i s i spent a lot of time on the internet um surfing around doing the same thing
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0071148_0071367	okay thank you very much
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0093019_0093692	these are all the s uh technical uh electric electronic components uh components which uh which we have to use in a remote control
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0047301_0048236	but he w he can reduce the sound he can bring the volume down and he can watch he can uh while talking he can watch the t. v.
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0165119_0165290	and the design and compact
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0083753_0084199	and uh uh th there are no harsh materials used in that
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0017055_0017265	if two many buttons are pressed
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0134248_0134577	any particular comments by anybody
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0082452_0082974	uh it can be a plastic one hard plastic so that it can be strong
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0109916_0110176	and we ha we had uh a few buttons and all
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0164816_0165230	right colourful trendy trendy design and strong
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0104247_0104633	that's uh the uh the more code has been generated by the integrated circuit
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0072037_0072494	well um looks like we still have quite a choice of things out there
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0149939_0150324	and people are tired of hard plastic and hard metal
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0018818_0019144	also mentioned was uh maybe different shapes
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0051517_0052189	but if you want to see we c if you want to see the nine channel if you say just say nine channel
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0056861_0057360	so you can you can design an interface which is very simple and which is user friendly
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0057360_0057596	even a kid can use that
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0145782_0146250	ours has to be look really great and it has to come out before the others
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0168945_0169070	well i think it
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0128530_0128654	oh that's interesting
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0098714_0098982	uh when you press a button when you do that
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0102181_0103151	suppose uh the p uh user has pressed button button one then it will have a sp the circuit will generate a specific market to pu uh that that button
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0064655_0064779	next slide please
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0058505_0059282	and this has multi purpose use it can be used for cable it it can be used for v. c. r. d. v. d. s and audio
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0113411_0114156	yeah the um can y uh you can see the t. v. w. double one eight three five labelled uh chip um
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0088688_0089579	it should it should uh be able to r uh resist the uh temperature uh uh size uh high temperature and low temperatures
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0085230_0085823	blue red green so uh uh we have to use a some colouring component component components
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0159121_0159844	now it's it's it's uh yeah it's it's like you're recording a b uh all uh um a question already
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0086444_0087057	um we sh uh we can use a highly sophisticated one because it's like the it's like the heart of the remote controller
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0021374_0021488	interface design then
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0042459_0043076	for example if you're watching a french programme and you would like to have uh a sub titles in english
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0168722_0168921	am not sure what they mean by supplements
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0160229_0160992	and my user and my family members are the user i will already record a uh question like
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0175288_0175809	you will receive specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0037796_0037911	nine channels switches
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0013868_0014315	and maybe it could be sold by using a slogan
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0116861_0117506	actually uh building a circuit bo board is pretty pretty uh easy and also it's uh it's a l it's a l innovative
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0041810_0042459	then there should be a button which can give sub titles for a particular programme which is going on at evaluation
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0061014_0061664	uh this is user friendly it's very attractive and uh children can use it as well as they can play with it
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0154519_0154897	you wanna try to come back to yours and limit yours a little
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0173847_0174301	and the marketing expert with the product evaluation
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0131214_0131805	like we can have uh m material such as plastic rubber wood titanium but titanium we can't use
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0119311_0119607	the thing like uh you know you don't need to use wires and the l
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0032145_0032361	and that's number two right
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0151820_0152029	um that
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0101828_0102181	every button every individual button has it's own more code
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0048236_0048884	now the most important feature i would like to have in my remote would be the speech recognition feature
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0057596_0057810	so can you go on f the to the next slide
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0022213_0022856	of course should have an on off button and also has mention an interesting feature that it should have maybe a channel lock
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0156682_0157287	yeah but but uh but i'm uh very m very much doubtful how w how far it will work
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0065748_0066286	yeah i could lose that in a minute
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0071367_0071681	uh any comments on uh her presentation
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0092199_0092360	can you go on to the next light please
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0168978_0169657	supplement means like different types of features buttons you can have a mute button or a squapping button
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0137498_0138269	we don't have a lot of time left and we will still have to make a decision and the marketing expert has to present her uh her thing
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0107871_0108100	then it will do the approximate action
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0130522_0130739	uh we have five minutes to the end of the meeting
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0163363_0163659	that that's that's gonna be most cost effective and the best thing
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0006997_0007904	from everyone to see how she best could market uh this this product at the within the budget uh that was given
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0164914_0165021	and also strong
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0055337_0055442	the n please next time
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0110781_0111206	like you can see a chip there which is having eighteen pens
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0160992_0161438	uh good morning like around eight o'clock i want to see the news in the television
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0120979_0121709	and also you can see uh there are b like uh um access for buttons like when you press a button
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0009457_0009814	so we should address that
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0030545_0030674	uh my slide please
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0155994_0156254	this could be a one feature which could be selectable
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0076735_0076947	oh who wants to go next um
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0109602_0109775	and uh n to the next slide please
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0125076_0126004	um b but a push button requires a simple chip underneath it but whereas as a scroll wheel requires normal chip which is a higher price range
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0084523_0085230	uh and uh uh yeah and also uh using of colouring components like uh if we want to have different colours
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0166028_0166645	user interface concept uh interface type supplements
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0015303_0016034	that has infrared bits and it has an interface controls wi interface that controls the chips
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0161438_0161756	so i'll say just good morning and the t. v. will switch on
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0167951_0168227	put i guess i guess uh for yeah
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0154766_0155184	uh yes i would like to include this feature which is called as voice recogniser
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0169802_0169923	right right right mm-hmm
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0163060_0163175	bad idea
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0049852_0050709	so a remote can be is can be uh designed which can have the voice recognises you can record your own voice
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0106205_0106914	the sensor in the t. v. can see the infrared light and seeing the signal seeing the signal it reacts appropriately
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0170012_0170726	okay so why don't we put down speech recognition if possible pending some more research from our industrial engineer on how expensive that is
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0074006_0074814	yeah um i don't think that's gonna be our impulse purpose at the kick out counter
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0014486_0015156	our technical manager has then said that he feels he should have a chip
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0122749_0122929	in um integrated circuit
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0081013_0081722	we have just pref uh down few uh components which we require for the remote control uh construction
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0081722_0082429	uh the first one is case to keep all the components like integrated circuit battery etcetera it's like
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0114940_0115695	and uh just beside that you can see a transistor and a uh uh signal shape uh that one is a capacitor
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0156529_0156793	that that would not be really good yeah i agree with that
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0029094_0029975	and uh i don't know whether the order matters much uh i don't i don't think so so whoever wants yeah okay
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0046272_0046472	there should be a mute button
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0008138_0008820	uh in general the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0097446_0097754	and how it works how the remote control works
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0115695_0116236	uh and also there are uh um resistors uh sorry th there is a doubt
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0023561_0023683	it should be compacted
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0037392_0037633	nine channel uh switches
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0157714_0157817	distance problem
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0044767_0045303	colour of the picture the contrast sharpness brightness of the picture
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0169264_0169694	yeah or or like our speech recognition would also be a supplement
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0092605_0093019	uh a dynamo a transistor a resonant
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0011343_0011676	or like she says put some signal into it in one way or another
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0028659_0029094	uh okay then we i'm looking for three presentations
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0158875_0159324	so to get a good recogni recognising system it's uh costly thing like
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0130672_0131029	yeah maybe th uh i have just one more slide i think
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0117850_0118489	because uh w uh when you when you are building a some circuits some um uh circuits and also wires
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0119607_0119842	it's not exactly wires we are using
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0130283_0130408	okay
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0108608_0108739	can you go to the next slide please
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0012321_0013004	that's a very important fact 'cause um if they say well i go home and think about it that won't work
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0073178_0074006	don't think that we can get uh the t. v. shape is good the child one is good the two big to miss place i think it's just funny
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0089579_0090048	and uh it should be with uh um equipped with timer and alarm facility
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0025804_0026480	uh maybe it should have uh electric electricity saving feature
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0120671_0120979	so the that green uh thing is is a circuit board
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0133716_0133830	and yeah that's it
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0100604_0101397	suppose you have pressed channel one button number one you have pressed then the uh chip will know that the number one button was pressed
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0037995_0038100	line numbers
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0140793_0141346	and then one i'm out um in people's houses or at meetings or anything like that
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0127968_0128534	so uh that also we can have in a battery uh or we can use solar cells
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0096832_0097215	and we we have a circuit board uh in a remote control
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0148032_0148872	so we've got a zero our selection down to l m two things i think that we're gonna say are really great about our our our new product
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0095016_0095434	even if it is a low performance battery it it ca it can't l it can't charge much
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0135352_0135967	yeah no the the the the scrolling was a different like you can go for s switches like buttons or scrolls
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0169701_0169802	oh that
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0153362_0154015	and um so what do we think on the concept
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0056263_0056861	so uh sometimes the user finds it it very difficult to recognise which button is for what function and all that
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0095628_0096094	then also we can if it is a rechargeable one then uh people can use it for a long time
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0135967_0136326	uh uh which which we used to do before ten ten years before i think
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0176912_0177406	wherever they're hiding
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0052189_0052811	uh the d uh the the uh yeah the remote will automatically it will switch to the nine channel
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0122929_0123067	can you go to the next slide please
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0137172_0137325	yeah uh yeah push buttons
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0072892_0073178	but uh we're gonna have to narrow it down a little more
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0080715_0080945	uh can you go on to the next slide please
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0040287_0040407	going to the next meeting
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0141346_0141886	and i tried to notice what kind of remote controls people have and if it's convenient in the communication i ask about
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0166960_0167250	that would be your area i think right you know
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0144923_0145145	okay i'm trying to finish fast for you
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0171259_0171654	uh our next meeting will be in thirty minutes
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0161998_0162607	okay before we get too far off here um the components of the concept is the energy
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0144355_0144558	they want each button to do something
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0074936_0075179	now i think th these are our presentations
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0158196_0158744	like maybe different people will be having different voices so like uh it's a everything so
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0157287_0157809	because uh speech recogniser like uh it it it has its own uh uh problems issues
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0077090_0077226	okay and you
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0040685_0040793	the next slide please
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0142685_0143016	um people like something that really fits in their hand
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0127306_0127968	um a kinetic provision of energy modern watches that you shake carefully to provide energy
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0132975_0133592	um yeah the um for the move we just uh developed a sample sensor speak sample speaker
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0037914_0038091	yes nine numbers
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0112409_0113165	the electronic components uh all of the electronic components have all those uh things like a chip and d uh radio transistors
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0074040_0074256	okay
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0008975_0009457	um it's also an item that people lose a lot
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0132583_0132975	um also infra it includes the infrared s uh sender
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0098982_0099792	you complete a specific connection that means when you when you press a button there will be a s a small circuit underneath the button
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0157856_0158196	yeah it's not a disadvantage problem it it's recognising a person's voice
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0163699_0163926	okay then chip on print
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0011777_0012321	so that the people are buying it now because in particular with smaller items
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0054117_0054527	so this is one one of the interface which can be created
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0030610_0030733	okay your slides
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0151717_0151820	okay
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0123124_0123528	uh so this is these are the circuits uh under underneath the buttons
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0054720_0055229	uh very simple interface which has all the t uh uh important features
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0085884_0086444	and uh the second important thing is uh uh uh integrated suit
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0103151_0103896	and the transmitter will amplify the signal and send them to the l. c. d. which translates the signal into infrared light
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0156276_0156529	yeah that could that could that could be our start feature
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0164267_0164756	and i think we all agree on the case we wanna have something uh maybe bright colourful
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0004479_0004718	um how uh are we doing
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0020468_0020854	uh for the for the uh image
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0142148_0142685	um and my findings from this is that you know small is beautiful
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0095434_0095628	it it it's not a high level of battery
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0010196_0010416	is that that is very simple to use
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0030733_0030920	oh okay
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0172871_0173724	and uh the u. i. d. is opposed to uh come up with the user interface design
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0138641_0139591	um alright my method uh is uh i'm interested in what the competition is doing and wanna see how we can make ourselves different from the competition
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0150982_0151470	so those are things maybe we wanna look at as far as is sellability of the item
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0126666_0127306	uh and uh as energy source we offer a basic battery uh more energy s a hard dynamo
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0093692_0094109	uh battery uh i would like to suggest one thing uh if we
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0087057_0087957	if it is not efficient than everything w is going to be uh like um thelef less efficient so it you should we should have a highly sophisticated one
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0137109_0137442	we'll just go for push buttons for in the interest of cost
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0074814_0075047	it's it's gonna be a little bit too unwealthy
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0145145_0145782	um and our preferences is as far as i'm concerned that we gotta get to the market before the competition
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0106914_0107871	that when it sees the amplified uh mor morse signal then it will uh it will uh b no which what p what action it has to uh do
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0123528_0123781	uh can you see the black uh round marks
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0045677_0045873	now they should be a memory switch
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0161756_0162029	it will recognise my voice and it'll switch on
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0066729_0067250	so this is a dummy universal remote control it's impossible to im misplace or lose
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0147354_0148032	if we try to tell people it has too many great features um the consumer just gets confused and we don't get anywhere
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0053586_0053930	so this is one of the very important feature a remote control can have
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0108950_0109602	when you look at the um um remote control um it's it's uh it this is a normal remote controller
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0152200_0152485	includes the presentation of every one
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0105088_0105449	that is the use of transistors transistor we which we use in the remote control
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0126004_0126666	like for scroll wheels we have to go for uh sophisticated and an c uh a full uh complete chip
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0066114_0066729	uh this is uh this is a very big you cannot place it at the bottom
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0108818_0108950	yeah i have few pictures
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0060165_0060335	can you go on to the next slide
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0024326_0024794	and the material should possibly be no of non ergonomic nature
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0116663_0116861	the green one is a circuit board
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0009814_0010097	and of course it should be something
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0105449_0106205	it will amplify the signal and it will send it to the l. e. d. and which translates the signal into an infra infrared bits
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0164048_0164176	okay
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0167428_0167885	um like the switches like we use buttons for user interface
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0144558_0144676	and eye catching is important
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0136783_0137172	so i think it's better we go for uh uh ordinary buttons
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0165087_0165205	frankly yeah
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0129358_0130124	uh usually the case is uncurved flat that w uh we see usually uh d uh uh a normal remote control
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0116498_0116663	so uh this is the second board
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0084199_0084349	and it should be recognisable
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0074229_0074411	yeah yeah i thi i think
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0076254_0076643	now i think our presentation was good and she really explained all the options
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0078010_0078122	it's it was the order
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0117506_0117850	uh it's it costs less than what you print on a paper
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0033756_0034196	now as an interface designer i would give more emphasis on the interface
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0158654_0158929	well you you teach you have to teach i
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0049045_0049572	it's an integrated programme programmable sample sensor speaker a unit
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0043076_0043969	then there should be a channel which can trigger this mechanism in the television so that the user can see uh the uh the supplements on the screen
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0057900_0058505	yeah so this is one of the interface or one of the remote which has this vib voice recogniser
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0147480_0147945	but what would you r on uh one being good and seven being the worst
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0011091_0012013	should be charged friendly design with few buttons colourful maybe with this star shaped or other shaped buttons
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0103051_0103417	total seven point six whatever that means
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0005591_0006464	uh it was discussed in the last meeting uh which was opened by the presentation from the interface um
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0131014_0131379	so i think that basically we've got a great product and we can get off and running with it
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0029697_0030149	so we prefer to have one or two features that can be really uh driven in
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0166342_0167206	uh uh i think they are quite big so i think uh i mean we c we can just have small buttons and more buttons in that case
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0178437_0178646	yeah yeah definitely
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0180745_0180864	yes we could
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0183540_0183677	yeah mini
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0169598_0170293	and um then maybe we can do something with the um
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0179899_0180315	we used white board we didn't use digital p well digital pens i guess our these things
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0054300_0054709	we have also included a button which is called as the swapping button
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0131419_0131783	um i just realise one thing
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0168775_0169598	so that that's where we're gonna have to do maybe we can eliminate one of the mute buttons instead of having two mute buttons
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0044970_0045542	now the um we decided upon including certain features and our remote
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0093918_0094226	uh electronic symbol chip on print
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0141656_0141844	think that was my last lot yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0144961_0145310	okay
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0084556_0084761	um i'm supposed to make a little presentation on it
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0098501_0098936	uh think uh that is uh w for for rubbers there is a yeah case
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0120514_0120928	they wanted the shape to be bio morphic i didn't want anything with angles and all square
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0064511_0065246	the buttons are all arranged and if you hold it in the centre of your hand you can even reach it over here so you don't have to turn it around
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0162068_0162501	and anybody else have any other comments or any other things that we feel we should evaluate
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0084864_0085297	now now this was our evaluation criteria which we uh just have done
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0178402_0178668	yes yes you have done a good job
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0057045_0057353	it would take the user to the previous and the next channel so this is up
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0180636_0180757	yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0146395_0146789	um okay so on shape
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0141654_0141780	yes it is
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0158088_0158204	oh i'll give it a three
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0165682_0166106	yeah include some more buttons and uh um yeah features
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0144286_0144428	oh it's not a good idea
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0094872_0095121	uh regular chip on print
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0133730_0134107	and so we've got we still got four euros to go to spend
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0053896_0054005	of the uh proposal
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0034072_0034535	now uh we are ready for the presentation of the prototype
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0148505_0148664	yes i think uh shape is one
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0070404_0071261	uh the the these these two are the w to increase or decrease the volumes and these two are to uh scroll the programme channels
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0067786_0068008	the colours very attractive
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0142596_0142934	and i'm supposed to present this scale on the white board
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0059316_0059420	that's better okay
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0190501_0191179	yeah but we we we were told we would end the final meeting at any time
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0111535_0112165	now we would like to have a presentation by the marketing expert on production evaluation
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0185896_0186554	today we have apple juice and after we sell a million of 'em we have champagne
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0065246_0065653	turn it upside down move it up up and down i really like that
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0042426_0042999	yeah because uh w you'll be touching the buttons more so it is soft when you touch it in
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0189421_0189660	are we always get it on here but getting it off is
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0183545_0183798	and think we were we were very good yeah mm
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0067081_0067808	yes and it sort of sticks up so that you really you don't have to first go like oh yeah here it's on and s yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0014410_0015315	the industrial designer um presented her uh thoughts on the issue
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0138250_0138356	it's yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0077093_0077224	yeah it's a snake
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0079632_0080257	uh think voice recognition is our big selling point 'cause nobody else seems to have that in in this price range
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0117552_0118356	we don't s want somebody to suddenly come to us and tell us that this button is toxic and you know some child will swallow it and then we won't sell any
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0161160_0161279	yeah yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0023384_0023891	should be battery operated and of course should have the special cases
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0049751_0050264	we've also included two buttons for increasing or decreasing the volume
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0112217_0112448	okay i'll take my file down so you can bring it up
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0072255_0072883	well i have one question uh will there be anything written on the buttons
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0123207_0124124	so periodically the other features in other words the look the feel um and the shape that's what people are gonna get in the store
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0076855_0077167	for the sales yeah we have the sales shell
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0127341_0127967	uh i think that it's i think that it's plenty small enough to sell but i think we're sort of right the scale is one to seven
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0183727_0184471	uh i think we we did uh in more than one respect and uh so i think we did it very well here
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0074614_0074775	yeah of course and also
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0177258_0177401	um
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0033325_0033798	and that includes the presentation from the last minutes from the last meeting
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0178213_0178697	oh i think you've done a good job missler
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0095977_0096116	oh
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0047312_0047703	now we have included another feature that is the mute button
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0110834_0110979	um
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0152668_0152819	colour i gave it a one
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0073384_0074001	yes it will have uh these buttons will have the numbers and all the rest of the buttons will have symbols
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0133554_0133711	eight eight twenty yes
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0030916_0031126	he feels that's really what people want today
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0094226_0094356	is that what we're using
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0078678_0078822	it's the
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0086822_0087076	it's sorry sorry
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0042228_0042451	oh that's good yeah that's nice in front
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0086184_0086437	one there is a production evaluation
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0135522_0136083	as a finish product and saying okay with the voice recogniser that costs so much
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0178586_0179168	and uh i think team work i think it was very very good i think we really we worked
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0013227_0013457	oh yes
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0073933_0074457	we'll have symbols so that that that the user really knows you know and doesn't have to first learn it
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0122686_0123207	and functionality i put last on my list because people are gonna use it before they buy it
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0155051_0155410	okay i gave it a three two yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0074001_0074203	yes which can be easily recognised
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0103669_0103947	the three four five six seven eight nine
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0191856_0192197	let's take the time to get my microphone out for myself
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0079005_0079329	now what what are our special features for the marketing
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0061773_0061987	now the marketing expert has to
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0156922_0157788	well it's also you can't really try it out uh the other things you have more is or are more tangible so from that point of view but um
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0159432_0159557	well um
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0151338_0151479	okay
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0124124_0124344	they don't have a television in the store they can't play with it
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0119781_0120514	okay now the things that i was thinking and w my wish list is really been realised in this prototype
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0121283_0121644	the size is small the colour is bright and warm which is what we wanted
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0069314_0069519	so you can pick either one
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0188646_0188930	what i i have my cord behind you here
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0187669_0188086	feasible from the production point of view and feasible for um marketing point of view
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0090085_0090281	so we i guess we use one
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0170425_0170535	the volume control
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0068008_0068633	um the um these buttons uh around here are the mute
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0122239_0122686	even though it's gonna be hard plastic it feels good in your hands so that's nice
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0140907_0141086	so it'd be easier of that
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0035625_0035939	uh so this is uh what um we have made it
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0028058_0029057	to do that uh maybe one or two features should be developed on which we could delay on or in another words on which our campaign could be built on
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0069159_0069314	on both sides i mean
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0188280_0188412	so thank you
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0158869_0159019	uh three mm
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0119064_0119388	we think it's good we're gonna get behind it and sell it
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0154776_0154971	uh i think i will give it a two
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0043039_0043332	and then um uh for the for the led
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0098936_0099082	oh okay then okay
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0114846_0115717	okay well uh obviously my method for uh s m the marketing of this thing is first to ask the big question will it sell
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0085663_0086259	ah but in my instructions i think it's that i was supposed to go to the board and do something
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0176806_0177143	uh i think personally i think uh i'm pretty happy
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0100797_0101105	now 'cause we didn't put the clock in it after all right
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0123878_0124032	so that's what people are gonna get
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0118628_0119064	and then after that we just have to go with our best intuition and you know we like it
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0155919_0156691	and the next is functionality where i i admit i was a little hard on our team here but
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0098722_0099264	that's just for the case material so special colour so we having that right
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0052399_0052600	uh i mean the menu one one
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0174986_0175438	so the the question really is how do we feel with the project process
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0189656_0189882	think we still have some time left
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0182537_0182670	oh i think that's true
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0019599_0019852	and how it would work you press the button
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0051690_0052136	now our our model also contains a button which is called as the menu button
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0126043_0126301	the it's really really excellent shape
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0161362_0161910	but um otherwise i think we're we're already go to go with this product
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0128975_0129552	and given um the constraints that we had i think we got it as soft as possible
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0009020_0009435	could have a memory switch a mute button in case the television rings or something
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0085140_0085243	okay
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0180322_0180811	yeah maybe we could have used the whiteboard a little bit more yeah we didn't use that enough
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0013485_0014410	but uh our very fo personal favourite really she she would very much like to see a speech recogniser integrated in this remote
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0080276_0080937	and then and then the other thing would basically be sh shape or practicality of use
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0078888_0079032	that would really work
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0083897_0084011	and the voice recognition
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0012013_0012926	um she uh presented also an upgraded remote uh which she guarantees nobody will ever be able to lose
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0143817_0144241	um sorry i f um forgot to do that um
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0153405_0153617	one one one okay
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0170918_0171804	um and couple of other c maybe comp uh calculate some of the usage and and see what we can do with that
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0097826_0097962	uh would rubber
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0147227_0147341	and i gave it one
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0190111_0190291	ah you have
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0124378_0124658	um so they'll be our main selling points
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0108986_0109101	ami should be from
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0152988_0153157	uh i i like the colours
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0177613_0178216	and then the next question is are we happy with the leadership of this project
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0101930_0102129	yes do we do have a special form
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0136202_0136654	so um we just have to be ready of that
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0114688_0114846	yeah right
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0127967_0128408	and i think we're sort of right in the middle as far as c other competitors
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0169338_0169663	yeah definitely yeah two mute but
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0134116_0134616	and in maximum we have another four point three euros i mean m for thirty
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0058041_0058417	the next channel in the numeric pattern or
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0090983_0091358	the colour chart you're trying to change is protected
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0133822_0134090	we have it for euros yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0158223_0158340	okay
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0140581_0140742	the special features
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0179398_0179899	and uh i think we ha are happy with the means we used
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0063112_0063579	what uh what i really like a lot about it is that you can reach the whole thing with one thumb
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0093443_0093918	um kinetic solar so that's in the energy source that's all we need
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0035939_0036376	that is a model of the remote control which we are going to build
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0061477_0061773	so this is a proposed model
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0077167_0077358	he goes right back into his cell
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0097444_0097645	plastic we said right
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0086604_0086809	but that's after the financing
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0146050_0146395	so now we're all supposed to say what we think
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0145937_0146050	yeah really
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0092731_0092979	oh okay yeah okay let's see
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0053724_0053828	oh-huh
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0069986_0070147	this is the man w yes yes
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0098878_0098991	you this for the keys
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0049439_0049590	oh-huh
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0031293_0032097	uh the decision that we took last time was that uh the special feature we would like to see is a speech recogniser
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0068759_0069052	um these are here
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0108661_0108807	uh i just tried that
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0054854_0055307	now this is uh a special special feature which we have included
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0188476_0188646	okay
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0167206_0167460	if we want to have more features in that
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0152819_0153059	uh really like all those nice bright warm colours
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0116800_0117268	we can't accept every suggestion of course but maybe we just need to get a few
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0091530_0091813	you told me i could just change it here and then it would
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0163765_0164417	here is what we're looking at uh satisfaction on for example room for a creativity
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0066948_0067118	that's that's a really good thing
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0065653_0066194	you really did a good job on that my little designers
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0185498_0185849	the possibility is you can't
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0107999_0108108	uh-huh uh-huh
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0030288_0030916	um it should have a fruit and vegetable design and should have a soft feel
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0019263_0019471	uh and of course the circuit board
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0071408_0071569	scroll up or scroll down the chip
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0152596_0152725	colour uh i'm
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0095286_0095859	that's all we need the one case uncurved flat single curved double curved
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0186776_0187153	um i think this was very good and um
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0152066_0152323	um and then how about how we doing on the colour
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0058428_0059316	zapping is if if if example you are uh you are watching the second channel and then you go to the tenth channel and if you want to go back to the second channel you can scrap
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0100368_0100500	scroll wheel no
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0056591_0056916	if it is turned towards the right it will take to the next channel
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0149676_0149785	on sides
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0185374_0185896	celebration
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0059376_0059485	okay okay
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0094238_0094352	yeah what we're using yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0017284_0018010	should like to see a timer and or alarm facility integrated it yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0085297_0085576	now we're gonna talk about financing
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0190479_0190598	oh yeah we have time limit but
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0118356_0118628	so we have to get some input from those people
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0048112_0048363	and the side of the model
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0110431_0110834	me gonna be popular
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0155570_0155756	oh maybe two yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0041445_0042426	um the material is plastic and uh for the buttons it is a p s uh soft rubber um and all yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0096533_0096673	let's guess it's double curved
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0094685_0094872	okay one
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0184947_0185232	uh it's the project evaluated
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0067684_0067788	and it's yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0074976_0075613	but anyway it would ha it uh it has to have some kind of of symbols text or something so that people
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0104663_0104891	nine points okay yes
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0182303_0183135	yes i think so i think absolutely and f unfortunately we all had slides presentation which made it a little easier
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0185367_0185861	um then celebration
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0048363_0048767	then we have included one to nine buttons
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0048890_0049190	for controlling the programmes the different channels
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0171906_0172054	and maybe it
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0076128_0076730	and one more feature is we have a holder for this remote which is an outsider shape
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0077042_0077318	so it is yeah yeah sure
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0132429_0133181	and uh i don't know how we can evaluate that or how we can include that too
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0148683_0149060	okay and one okay
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0150516_0150699	uh think i would give you at least a two
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0139103_0139488	as we've seen with so many of these kind of products
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0105236_0105427	so we looks like we are
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0102276_0102552	and special material rubber wood yes
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0149756_0149886	you you gave it a four
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0003938_0004133	well hi everybody again
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0075924_0076155	okay yeah just wanna make sure of that
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0092477_0092677	can you just fill it in in the yellow boxes
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0062120_0062796	it give us a suggestion whether it will be sellable or it will be cost effective
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0067220_0067346	yeah that's great
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0099509_0099901	and then we have the interface push buttons
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0006564_0006687	does my name
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0059919_0060901	and at the end it this remote has in built voice recogniser which c which will recognise the users voice and then it will act according
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0185590_0185884	oh
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0104683_0104824	that's mm-hmm
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0094559_0094685	come on
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0065317_0065522	or have two hands to operate it yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0081579_0082128	uh think we have to we have to we have to deal on on on the appeal
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0022804_0023264	uh scrolling method is more expensive and not that practical anymore
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0089637_0089762	okay now
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0016564_0017116	should have an integrated circuit board that's highly sophisticated and technological resistant
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0138351_0139103	and um it may not be the greatest quality but it may sell anyway
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0165536_0165724	we can always improve yes
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0159803_0160156	it looks like we got uh got ourself a pretty good product
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0034881_0035112	does the look like the button pad i'll explain
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0084011_0084185	there gonna be our two selling points
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0183135_0183441	um did we new did we find new ideas
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0119388_0119535	um next slide please
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0069570_0069806	so if you're left handed or right handed it doesn't matter
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0029213_0029697	too many new features or too many points would only confuse metal
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0068745_0069236	now these the front buttons which are here at the mute buttons on both sides
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0141086_0141328	you wanna go to this next slide
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0046331_0046436	uh-huh uh-huh
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0141252_0141534	um well i is this my last slide
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0142934_0143589	um and we're supposed to talk about those things as a team now so if you put my last slide back up there
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0052836_0053649	we have included a button which is florescent green colour and this is the menu button which will control the colour sharpness brightness
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0109683_0109836	okay find
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0153617_0153839	and how about the feel
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0140779_0140907	okay
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0044413_0044878	and and the button buttons part uh will be explained by f fancy
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0097223_0097444	case materials supplements
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0071387_0071489	oh it's very good
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0022216_0022696	she would like uh this whole thing should be push buttons with a simple chip
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0150247_0150389	um i don't know
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0180493_0180786	bye board more yes yes
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0117268_0117552	and show the the prototype to consumer research groups
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0128456_0128620	and our colour i think it's great
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0154126_0154680	taking in to um consider texture and comfort in the hand
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0168404_0168517	yeah definitely
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0072883_0073380	like that people know or they have to learn that from a piece of paper which button does what
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0038429_0039128	uh um and also y it it will be easily fit into into the hands and uh you can access all the buttons easily
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0131783_0132180	in the finance thing there was no room for our voice recogniser
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0106093_0106272	okay i should save this i suppose huh
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0103915_0104042	maybe you you just
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0125417_0126043	okay so um the shape um i think is a a one
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0130090_0131014	obviously we could have added uh added different functions but then we'd disturb something else so i would say that we got to a five out of seven on on functionality
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0098268_0098462	uh but yes but
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0144660_0144894	well because i can't remember what i put on there
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0062821_0062982	okay well um
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0071589_0071843	uh it looks don't looks like something i can sell
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0046564_0046958	now uh we have included the switch on and off but
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0170535_0170789	maybe we can put that all on one button
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0046289_0046397	yeah okay
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0088686_0089440	okay uh energy source we say that's battery right
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0114272_0114502	okay want you to move just to the next slide right away
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0165869_0165978	yes features
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0087996_0088686	okay now on the financing we bring up the mm there it is
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0171858_0172740	yeah al always bearing in mind that right now we are of course well within the budget and that we still you know we probably can't
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0071210_0071387	it's for okay
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0064279_0064480	yes the buttons are all erased right
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0050738_0051294	and we have also included two buttons for scrolling up and scrolling down the programme channels
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0129552_0130090	and then functionality um i think you did a really good job on functionality
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0082128_0082331	you're really gonna have the best the
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0148666_0148936	yeah even my yeah it's a one
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0110140_0110431	okay good so that's the good news
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0184719_0184848	are the costs within budget
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0042922_0043023	oh mm-hmm
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0026431_0026654	easy to use and it should be eye catching
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0096704_0096864	double curved
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0145310_0145611	yeah i suppose to see how long my legs is here
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0063579_0064261	that you can really hold it in one uh you don't need two hands and it's easily reachable even for somebody with a small hand yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0141540_0141654	it don't know
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0093328_0093443	okay away
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0148244_0148497	one okay and b bitty
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0080981_0081579	yeah uh well i think that everybody's gonna say they're remote control is practical
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0128620_0128975	the colours are bright and warm and we really did great job there
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0178981_0179274	yeah d i did too i think we worked well together as a team yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0124658_0125417	so um tho those have been fulfilled by your prototype and gonna head to the next slide please
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0140240_0140346	included it yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0074373_0074971	good point because we need the symbols 'cause we're going into an international market we can't have anything that's language dependent
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0177170_0177576	am i pretty happy with it too um it's something i think i can market it
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0103508_0103763	um i think that's the price
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0100500_0100770	in terms of scroll wheel l. c. d. display
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0078699_0078921	yeah yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0082708_0083555	so i think we have to play with the image play with the scale image um play with the visual and then the voice recognition
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0114600_0114759	you wanna go to the next slide
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0032218_0033189	the energy should be battery uh should be on a chip should be trendy design compact and strong and should have buttons
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0087539_0087996	okay we had locks and voice recognition
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0084293_0084575	okay now uh having said that
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0172740_0173341	with this particular item we probably can't just uh add a whole lot of more things
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0066194_0066948	um and um i like the idea that the on off button is in a really prominent place
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0082445_0082708	cutest remote control on the block
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0185232_0185367	yes
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0079329_0079718	that's really the voice recognition that's really unuseful
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0149863_0150178	uh i gave it a four yeah i feel it's just average
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0108969_0109144	my com i uh and here it is yes
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0013037_0013522	and she was charged on that point
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0133143_0133582	well um we had what eight eight euros twenty as our cost
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0108807_0108969	my documents computer
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0097975_0098164	rubber because we're gonna have the soft buttons
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0164981_0165391	is there more room for creativity or are we absolutely happy
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0149060_0149273	and how about on size
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0069948_0070393	that brings the menu up on the screen and the orange ones are
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0034773_0034881	yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0137150_0137939	well as we know in today's techno technological world you can do just about anything at any price uh the the problem is quality
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0104079_0104235	eight eight point two
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0174552_0174661	um
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0111164_0111424	so that uh i think financing was pretty simple
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0083555_0083713	think those are the two things to push
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0103665_0103782	that's the price
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0182205_0182421	and we use the slide because it was better presentation
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0101319_0101533	uh button supplement special colour
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0039502_0040024	you're used to have all the buttons
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0039300_0039665	yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0072104_0072410	okay and now i'm supposed to yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0151479_0152066	okay here are the designer of course you wanna give it a one
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0155687_0155789	two okay
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0075541_0076079	text that we can have on the case itself we c it will be printed on the case and samples as well
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0145622_0145736	think you can make it there
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0092979_0093328	okay one okay
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0121644_0122239	we wanted the feel to be as soft as possible we'll have the soft buttons and the way this is shaped
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0137939_0138351	so we're just gonna have to sell for whatever quality that will buy us
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0120928_0121283	or wanted to be comfy and roundy so we'd we'd got that
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0010653_0010780	um
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0043332_0044239	for the light emitting diode it is a fluorescent green and it's a b um it is a bulb like uh an ordinary infrared
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0186464_0186776	so i i think you all very much
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0190292_0190402	that's for example
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0151175_0151364	yeah you and i think it is one
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0069703_0069948	and this brings the menu up on the screen
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0013217_0013332	that's alright
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0137920_0138077	yeah it's good enough to listen to
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0187272_0187669	uh i think we did come up with a new product that's uh feasible
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0038147_0038429	uh and also compact in shape
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0138186_0138315	yeah yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0147945_0148244	um what do you think the shape is
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0136654_0137085	and i mean and no whether the four thirty will really cover that
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0134767_0135522	but i mean we have no way of presenting that to management as you know as a finished
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0134602_0134830	well um that's
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0027036_0027745	from our point of view of course one of the most important factors is that we should get to market before our competition does
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0166106_0166342	we can make the buttons f few buttons smaller
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0023811_0024629	we've got uh marketing expert for uh the trendy and user friendly look
AMI_TS3003a_H01_MTD011UID_0096589_0096752	okay
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0026316_0027089	our project method um is uh there are the three phases we're going through
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0124053_0124159	well it was on but
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0055437_0055560	oh is it
AMI_TS3003a_H02_MTD0010ID_0143150_0143256	they were all mentioned so
AMI_TS3003a_H01_MTD011UID_0097650_0097761	okay yeah
AMI_TS3003a_H01_MTD011UID_0147421_0147542	okay
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0002125_0002332	yeah
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0111506_0112430	um as you can see we um for a remote control uh selling price is uh at twenty five euros
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0039305_0039673	but then first you have to select the pen function
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0135420_0135720	but i don't know if it will exceed the production costs
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0112430_0112648	our selling price
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0036390_0036563	uh piece of drawing
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0137424_0137534	think it has to be shock proof
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0121790_0121955	yeah yeah
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0028819_0029177	but i think you know it already by yourself
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0104855_0105283	is it a dock et cetera or did you find 'em on the street oh
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0134250_0134482	so we have we want different functions
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0002332_0002629	let's guess so
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0047793_0048367	and uh just sum up uh a few of its favourite characteristics
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0021934_0022335	um okay what are we going to do
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0072964_0073228	the
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0033524_0034263	we are going to work with a lot of high tech tools here so it's it's handy if we have a little bit of training first
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0045592_0046119	so as you can see we're goin going to draw a animal
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0018423_0018701	have you seen any flores in it
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0001673_0001955	let's see you all find your places
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0016134_0016442	maybe you can take the minutes once in a while
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0128777_0129653	and you can uh programme i think eight different devices in it and you can use it for your television anything else
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0145518_0145955	and we can all work uh on our own projects
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0032189_0032473	so that's a bit what you're going to do
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0115933_0116883	so that's also a point we have to keep in mind that we won't make remote controls with small televisions inside and stuff like that
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0033218_0033524	then we've got our first tool training
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0061241_0061469	if you got no text tool no
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0047133_0047351	so everybody is anybody playing with the mouse
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0037867_0038005	that's pen
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0085882_0086049	let's go really slow when you're writing
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0062718_0063066	okay
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0066182_0066320	maybe you have to you just
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0035682_0035790	so you can save f
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0109896_0110175	okay
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0087944_0088144	they're brilliant animal animals
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0145174_0145405	finish meeting now
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0131716_0131893	so that's a pretty handy um
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0034870_0035579	um in the whiteboard here there's a little tool bar on this side
AMI_TS3003a_H01_MTD011UID_0128504_0128622	two
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0121006_0121414	so just on a side note why is it my laptop is only giving me a black screen
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0071194_0071407	go ahead
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0025776_0025899	it's also uh
AMI_TS3003a_H01_MTD011UID_0138219_0138494	hey you know what i oh well i c i mean uh
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0010687_0010968	it's being modified by the administrator
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0143328_0143680	and any questions about this uh presentation
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0136138_0136478	but that would be really good if we could do that
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0122107_0122208	does it do anything
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0009014_0009424	so this is our project documents folder
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0045264_0045479	and then we're going to try out the white board
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0081822_0081983	that's nice
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0145405_0145518	okay
AMI_TS3003a_H02_MTD0010ID_0103983_0104246	mine is a bit more skinny
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0040965_0041081	uh then
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0050930_0051366	another thing is you have to be uh a bit slow
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0140877_0141040	that's uh battery states
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0112946_0113775	uh that's the least we have to get from our remote controls so we have to work together to reach our aims
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0074356_0074838	maybe it's easier to draw a the smaller line with i think
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0037144_0037423	captain we don't have to do anything with
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0116883_0117060	it points work
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0120140_0120442	it's easier
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0123799_0123948	oh you just put it back oh yeah
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0049213_0049607	uh this i can start from now
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0026037_0026206	that's about the new remote control
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0072463_0072613	and i'm gonna draw 'em black
AMI_TS3003a_H02_MTD0010ID_0058364_0058516	okay
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0108818_0109508	so if you have any ideas or if you wanna draw anything on the whiteboard just ask and go ahead
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0046785_0046932	the cost is it running away
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0029177_0030124	the um industrial designer is going to work on the working design uh components design and a bit of the look and feel design
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0082994_0083320	little blue dot they always get spaded on their buttons
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0036897_0037144	uh select a pen receiver
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0108374_0108495	that's pretty clear
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0041240_0041513	uh short thing about documents
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0003809_0004274	and don't know if uh if everybody knows me so i'm bored a lot
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0035790_0036251	uh these functions we don't have anything to do with only undo you can undo a little bit
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0052990_0053502	that i think seven will be nice
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0136591_0136893	and other functions for a remote control
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0059063_0059197	and uh you can and do
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0057762_0057892	oh thinking about the sort of fish
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0047534_0047721	be going to uh draw an apple
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0108495_0108818	so everybody knows how to work with the whiteboard now
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0132568_0133401	uh think that if you can put different kind of devices in one remote control it makes it a lot easier as well
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0142216_0142437	but maybe just a little led i don't know
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0019753_0020054	now it doesn't work here
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0041935_0042279	for the documents lovely i think
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0049787_0050177	you can use this pen by holding it like uh like a little child
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0007797_0008416	uh there's also some microphones there but um you don't have to pay a lot of attention on those
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0053502_0053863	now you will see my drawing capabilities
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0011666_0012227	well i don't know if you've noticed but uh we're working for a real reaction
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0024629_0025214	and the industrial designer uh that's also user friendly and a bit original
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0014966_0015902	uh maybe i can sit down then i can take some notes or let's see
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0010947_0011353	mm that's interesting
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0037423_0037867	uh then we've got our pen
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0108160_0108374	okay
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0008416_0009014	because that will uh disappear when you don't attend to it
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0097550_0097667	the rubber
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0016442_0017136	uh don't know it's not a lot of work but just uh if you hear something uh you can write down just write it down
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0137840_0138045	my remote control tends to fall a lot
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0027089_0027568	first is functional des uh design individual workings
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0120698_0121118	okay that's uh good timing so
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0059354_0059576	this easily
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0130868_0131716	so that's pretty handy when you have a video recorder or d. v. d. player downstares and you've got it linked to your t. v. on the second floor
AMI_TS3003a_H02_MTD0010ID_0101447_0101812	let's try something else
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0122342_0122553	maybe we have to just clip it down
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0141432_0141994	but they'll all so really drag up the production costs so in we'll have to see about that too
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0110175_0110677	it's uh then a handful of whiteboard
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0069157_0069319	it leaves for the fun
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0022335_0022735	uh our project aim is is you can see a new remote control
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0009424_0009919	there are some notes in it already i see some documents
AMI_TS3003a_H01_MTD011UID_0088960_0089086	okay
AMI_TS3003a_H01_MTD011UID_0089086_0089595	um i'm just gonna draw it's uh head but mm
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0144935_0145048	and then we can all work
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0063989_0064107	maybe you have to hold it a bit
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0123396_0123568	and the slide show
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0134676_0135420	uh and we can maybe see if we can do something with infrared
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0041513_0041935	we've got our shared folder uh project in the f project it's
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0022735_0023113	it has to be original trendy and user friendly
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0058204_0058330	yeah that could another i
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0074838_0075126	because this is going a little better than uh i did
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0018701_0018949	think i found one
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0059878_0060429	and i've got to write down a few of his characteristics
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0142562_0142726	that's an idea as well
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0014290_0014771	uh we have our opening acquaintance tool training project discussion closing
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0133989_0134250	yeah that's nice think
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0023113_0023811	so these are uh the points by uh we also hired you
AMI_TS3003a_H02_MTD0010ID_0104256_0104553	but uh
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0030124_0031102	uh the user interface designer is going to do the technical function design user interface design
AMI_TS3003a_H01_MTD011UID_0099306_0099539	um use a blank or
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0005415_0005801	uh let's start off um with a little presentation
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0057113_0057800	ah i'm trying to draw a dolphin but i think he's nose has to be a little bit but it's closed
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0007037_0007797	they'll record uh our actions and you all have violators and microphones they'll record your voice
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0123948_0124102	that will be okay i think
AMI_TS3003a_H02_MTD0010ID_0100934_0101447	well i was gonna draw a cat too so
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0126555_0126717	now
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0011206_0011375	let's do it read only
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0133645_0133757	that's good to remember
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0143680_0143793	kick off presentation
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0017136_0017525	uh as you can see uh it's the opening accountants tool training
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0130326_0130868	and then you can operate it from the third or th uh second floor
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0138102_0138274	sh sorry
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0129653_0130326	and it also operates on infrared so you have we've got a little device inside your room
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0064300_0064408	upside down
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0124381_0124649	uh that's those laptops
AMI_TS3003a_H01_MTD011UID_0120696_0120802	five minutes okay
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0132139_0132460	um but only the
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0028113_0028683	that i had some roll indications on here
AMI_TS3003a_H01_MTD011UID_0129479_0129580	okay yeah
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0004703_0004842	welcome
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0044097_0044751	it's what that you just said it save print move back or forward one page
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0104111_0104351	yeah it's pretty skinny c
AMI_TS3003a_H02_MTD0010ID_0105690_0105971	well it's supposed to be a cat
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0088144_0088316	and that's just a little meeting
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0139500_0140030	um i will put the minutes from this meeting uh in our project folder
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0088855_0089191	let's all pass the pen to our user interface designer
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0118948_0119275	so that leads us to our little discussion
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0038005_0038928	it's really funny because you can draw it with it on this page um in the i think it is format
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0006558_0006834	uh first i'll tell you a little bit about the setting
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0118393_0118770	and production cost uh maximum twelve and a half euros
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0058494_0058654	well
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0046119_0046785	just to uh yeah just to get a bit familiar with it
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0005014_0005415	uh let's see
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0018949_0019052	the
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0128030_0128442	and i think it's it would be best to just make one remote control that can operate them all
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0064408_0065073	think that's it because if you want uh are going to do it like this then it will be a stripe
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0109508_0109679	it's pretty uh easy
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0099496_0099666	yeah just a blank sorry
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0047394_0047534	okay but
AMI_TS3003a_H01_MTD011UID_0130635_0130751	oh okay yeah
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0117394_0118393	setting price twenty five profit aims fifty million um but more important is the int international market we're trying to focus on
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0004274_0004381	though
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0070477_0071194	so now i'm gonna hand over the pen on the new blank sheet to you
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0114717_0115143	um but that's all in the later stage
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0019089_0019267	can't say i paid much attention to it but
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0032473_0032816	but that will be all worked out in the other meetings
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0053863_0054193	that's not very much but uh
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0035579_0035682	here are some functions
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0117060_0117394	so just try to remember these points
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0083669_0084081	for recognition yeah i see
AMI_TS3003a_H02_MTD0010ID_0101812_0102060	something different than garfield
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0051366_0051895	because if you're going to draw it like really fast then the pen won't hold up
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0111125_0111506	move a long to the project finance
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0019605_0019753	see if it works this way
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0144376_0144790	okay then i'll put the minutes from this meeting in the project folder
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0119783_0120140	so i'm gonna sit down and think
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0133775_0133967	so i think you can take minutes again
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0139019_0139500	so these are um few things we can think of
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0042279_0042895	but all uh you all found that already because there are a lot of documents in it already so that will be okay
AMI_TS3003a_H02_MTD0010ID_0143042_0143150	now
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0054362_0054579	ah see you have to do it real slow
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0043941_0044097	here is the simple two o. r
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0127508_0128030	one for the t. v. one for the video recorder one for the d. v. d. player
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0025298_0025776	and we've got our user interface designer
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0042895_0043697	and these are available on the smartboards as well so if you have a document you wanna show just open it from the folder
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0146818_0147455	okay then i'll make you in about a half an hour i think
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0110677_0110990	so we've got the tool uh introduction
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0141085_0141213	how much is left in the battery
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0039673_0040011	but we're going to work with it in a minute
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0040011_0040261	so okay
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0017917_0018314	um have you all seen the corporate website already
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0050177_0050801	because if you hold it like this the sensors will get blocked and then the drawing won't get
AMI_TS3003a_H01_MTD011UID_0098652_0098803	so uh
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0047311_0047578	oh in going
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0135720_0136021	so that will uh that's something we have to find out i think
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0001955_0002125	so everybody is sitting on the right place
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0021274_0021934	real remote is not really the company we are but it's just a little bit
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0126251_0126555	like you can use for other
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0003595_0003809	first i'll introduce myself
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0068484_0068929	uh think it's it wants to draw uh another animal
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0058654_0058775	now we've got another thing to mention
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0063399_0063541	yeah
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0082050_0082163	with of course
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0137040_0137329	maybe we can make it uh uh
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0014063_0014177	this is our agenda
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0121519_0121952	uh maybe you have to say the magic word
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0065073_0065319	but i don't know just trying
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0126909_0127508	kind of brought t. v. at home and a d. v. d. player so we got like a lot of remote controls
AMI_TS3003a_H02_MTD0010ID_0105971_0106118	it like cats because uh
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0006834_0007037	and you can see uh a few cameras here
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0147455_0147639	so good luck
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0063066_0063677	this is technically uh an do action i think
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0013476_0013865	and i bought a but i'm project manager so i'll address you through the project
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0120442_0120622	have got the message
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0084307_0084551	uh maybe you can also write your name somewhere
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0038928_0039305	you can also select the current colour and the line width
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0140149_0140381	yeah it one other little thing
AMI_TS3003a_H01_MTD011UID_0097240_0097352	the no uh this
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0071435_0071629	okay
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0073228_0073584	okay i'm not much of an artist but here we go
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0044751_0044947	you can switch between the different drawings
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0119275_0119783	we've got about five or ten minutes left for discussion
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0070319_0070477	it lifts for the fun
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0012227_0012529	uh it's a company in uh electronics
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0057962_0058204	so yeah it's a bit of a soft cushion
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0083396_0083669	it's a real date sheet yeah
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0104568_0104700	and the most interesting tale
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0036563_0036897	uh blank new documents for each person
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0020054_0020335	okay no problem
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0115233_0115933	our production cost um can be maximal twelve and a half euros
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0049607_0049787	that will
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0080540_0080833	that is my um
AMI_TS3003a_H01_MTD011UID_0137977_0138110	what a profit for uh
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0034263_0034870	as you can see we've got the smartboards here and here in the white board
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0018314_0018423	yeah
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0027568_0027992	after the functional design then the conceptual design and the detailed design
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0128564_0128777	yeah i've i've got one at home
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0058775_0059063	we've got the eraser
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0010968_0011206	uh okay
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0065568_0066182	it's not my work okay
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0140381_0140763	thought it might be handy to put a battery status display on it
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0096816_0097227	it's a three
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0072127_0072250	and use a different line width
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0070024_0070319	it's my criteric uh characteristic about the dolphin
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0020335_0021274	but um on the corporate information side there's th uh there was real remote instead of real reaction
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0040261_0040873	uh that's very simple and it's easy to uh draw your findings and drawings on there
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0113775_0114717	uh we can do it international so we have to focus on different kind of users different kind of customers and different kind of trends as well
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0001346_0001673	oh good morning
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0009919_0010145	uh i'll start with the presentation kick off
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0012529_0013476	we put fashion in electronics uh we make it work uh we put uh a lot of effort in design and in the product itself
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0059684_0059878	uh it's okay
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0017525_0017917	yeah against this is a point we've done a bit
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0004590_0004703	but
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0080139_0080540	okay
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0060429_0060744	uh it is
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0112648_0112946	uh our profit aim is fifty million euros
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0048367_0049213	um the only thing we have to uh look after is that we use different colours and different line width
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0147559_0147956	just that that you just keep the teletext
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0167313_0167540	oh i don't think there's much to be gained in that area
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0032210_0032702	um channel selection was also indicated to be used very frequently
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0123095_0123267	yes
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0096340_0096614	so this is a schematic overview
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0189311_0189747	and it wouldn't have to be touch screen or a very expensive screen but
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0194768_0195087	um general functions
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0177991_0178153	because i think that's uh
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0145856_0146019	or it's teletext uh
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0067608_0068347	well what uh i was uh thinking about was um uh keep the general functions uh like the r.
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0141918_0142419	because what you told is they uh channel selection is important
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0209085_0209464	it's better to put it on different markets with it all
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0009312_0009719	so that we can move on to the second uh phase
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0133100_0133414	sixteen to forty five ages category
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0162025_0162220	and i don't know if many channels would
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0037943_0038068	design
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0190417_0190679	so some extra info
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0198880_0199316	uh that's um specify the target group
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0089709_0089819	we would have to look into that
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0162508_0162612	if many t. v. s have that
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0203801_0203905	so that's the
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0147057_0147374	is it anyway uh really against teletext
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0112666_0113257	um this is um a bit pity for the marketing uh expert
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0058658_0059215	it think our we uh must use the general functions uh of the remote control
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0142809_0142949	yeah okay
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0017511_0017947	so i should just um let's start to the first presentation
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0058444_0058658	um yeah
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0089727_0090130	yeah maybe we can first um listen to your presentation
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0183919_0184252	and you just press a button and the phone goes ringing
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0205042_0205196	had to look into that a little more
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0176788_0177115	uh it is allowed in the budget we have
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0157740_0158506	because if you should if you want to switch from channel one to like thirty five you don't wanna push the next channel button thirty five times
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0156213_0156360	think if you if you only l
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0174570_0174717	uh uh like other functions
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0193639_0193800	oh
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0035438_0035637	they won't spend their money very easily
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0203850_0204211	if we're able to really bring an innovative product
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0193270_0193639	um let's see what did we say
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0158491_0158797	uh maybe we can implement the scroll button
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0064041_0064353	uh oh uh yeah i
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0206234_0206344	in any in every country
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0061158_0062113	yeah uh i've been thinking about uh simple channel uh to put a lot of functions uh uh in one um and one uh remote control
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0110739_0111063	uh maybe also on televisions it will be available as well
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0031550_0032074	which are not really used very frequently but are still considered to be of some importance
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0137251_0137367	we don't have the controls
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0178256_0178456	that's a good advanced point as well
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0170166_0170339	to operate only the t. v. yeah
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0068347_0068665	so uh like uh the on and off uh button
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0093285_0093468	the user presses a button
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0177604_0177913	and if the remote stays rather small it should be possible yeah
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0114648_0115449	and we have to be very uh attached in uh putting the corporate image uh in our product
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0092777_0093003	um first about how it works
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0029867_0030117	and teletext got a six and a half
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0205739_0206094	oh i don't think they have different television sets uh
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0070895_0071491	what i was thi uh thinking about was um you got um
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0178456_0179363	if we have uh fancy looking docking station or very well yeah so that that's a nice requirement
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0087143_0087685	the kind of uh touch screen um and s uh for uh
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0079706_0079809	uh yeah
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0193869_0194233	should be fancy to fancy design easy to learn
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0009959_0010273	um first an announcement
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0161363_0161899	the t. v. would need an a function where you can actually view all channels and scroll through it
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0010273_0010705	there's a little adaptation in the arc decision system
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0187315_0187701	the thing since a lot of people indicated that a new remote control is hard to learn
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0197899_0198437	think probably elderly people would be a little bit more careful with their remote controls and
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0129104_0129298	yes but it's not the biggest part of the
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0088627_0088837	well it would certainly make a fancy design
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0209464_0209598	okay
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0057741_0058050	yeah i should go to the top thingy
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0015769_0016354	and then we can have a little discussion about the new project requirements uh which have been sent to me
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0093099_0093285	everybody knows how remote works
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0151402_0152064	um so i think teletext can be very useful in our advantage
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0032702_0032943	one hundred and sixty eight times per hour
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0163275_0163548	they're not used to using scroll buttons
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0111672_0112578	uh that's the the market we have to d to target because we are going to develop a new product which is specially designed for the younger customers
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0190939_0191060	think that's a good idea as well
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0180850_0181039	like to have extra in a remote control
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0079809_0079945	so a detachable
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0027508_0027939	and fifty percent of the people indicated that they remote tended to get lost in their room
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0126238_0126970	uh if we put a lot of effort into those we can make a remote control with uh just two or three buttons
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0052436_0052805	but up until forty five it remains feasible
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0142763_0142882	so yeah
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0079945_0080395	uh and um the b the buttons uh the real buttons uh we have to use um
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0175413_0175845	yeah i think mean we obviously need a good way to position all the buttons and
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0162693_0163275	and besides that it's um if we're gonna focus on elderly people they'll have to adapt
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0182000_0182443	yes well fifty percent of the people indicated that the remote control tended to get lost
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0166497_0167313	because i think there are pretty many remote controls that can only operate a t. v. which already only have the minimum number of buttons
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0184706_0185126	think it's not too expensive just uh
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0206761_0207008	we've got five minutes left yes you still
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0167618_0167813	the number of buttons
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0104926_0105724	um i'm the project manager so i'm here to mess things up and uh tell you some new uh requirements
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0182965_0183188	yeah that was what i suggested
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0114304_0114648	uh remote control and the other way around
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0017291_0017511	so we've got forty minutes for all of it
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0191151_0191307	but i don't know if that would
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0116026_0116572	and uh we have to be uh very clear on this point as well
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0149346_0149725	another point of advantage in our remote control
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0148167_0148477	think that's a good idea as well especially for the sub titles
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0023220_0023526	uh see what the market consists of
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0066354_0067014	um few uh buttons but uh this uh remo remote control got uh a lot of uh buttons
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0123533_0123878	besides that i think the market for forty plus is like
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0125292_0125439	in not innovative
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0062994_0063317	but uh it must be a user friendly
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0199966_0200687	because i think what we're going to design now is for people above sixty maybe
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0121414_0122133	in addition people indicated that teletext simply was an important feature for the remote control
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0074276_0074438	that's a touch screen
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0124406_0124593	yes
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0089266_0089531	it's very fragile and you can get scratches on it
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0212102_0212432	use interface design and the user interface concept and the trend watching
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0136466_0137249	yeah if we if we make a remote control just l with that idea in mind we could make tones a money i think
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0135277_0136073	think that if we're if we put our marketing right um we can sell this just like um i don't know if you've heard about it in the news
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0096005_0096340	it's a very simple device technically speaking
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0153794_0154038	oh don't think that's really an issue anymore 'cause
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0023890_0024460	well these are three quite astonishing results i thought
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0115449_0116026	so it has to be visible in our design in the way our device works
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0072551_0073217	uh this is the remote control uh and uh you can get here the general functions
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0030700_0030927	then there are some one time use function
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0111183_0111672	another one is uh the customer is um forty plus
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0083631_0084232	well i think if we're gonna use a touch screen uh we're gonna go way above the twelve and a half euros
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0133626_0134077	because they are critical and they they want to have a fancy remote control
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0172304_0172602	that would that would cost an a big marketing
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0181259_0181390	um
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0068974_0069596	uh everybody everybody knows it so uh uh you don't have to change that
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0155441_0155821	volume up volume down and some teletext buttons but
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0204681_0204871	yeah
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0014502_0015365	um and we've got forty minutes for the whole uh pres for the whole uh presentations
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0214081_0214385	so um i think you for this meeting
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0033502_0034115	um sixty percent of the market consists of users between the ages sixteen and forty six
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0092001_0092351	think it's going to uh it's not too much 'kay
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0093468_0093999	the remote determines what button it is uses the infrared to send a signal to the t. v.
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0012157_0012339	it's in king c. and e.
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0202807_0203198	and i think it would be really good for uh for the image of the company
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0049655_0049890	so you know where it is in the room
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0101208_0102046	so it's in my idea it's uh it's gonna be smart to invest in desi in design and not in a in the product itself
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0143323_0144055	now we we haven't voted yet so uh i think teletext can be uh
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0092373_0092777	okay i've got a presentation about the working design
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0083172_0083306	okay
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0022936_0023220	uh in addition we did some market research
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0081303_0081664	uh al even uh of uh all people uh young people
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0164236_0165076	yeah we can see how much buttons there are going to be on on the display and if it's too much we can uh reconsider it
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0148680_0148786	maybe we can
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0205234_0205344	okay
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0157219_0157339	maybe we can
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0213492_0213955	and uh specific instructions will be sent to you by uh the personal coach
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0160699_0161089	oh don't think there are many t. v. s that can switch channels that fast
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0176306_0176456	now
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0094422_0094811	so we've got um the the play
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0194469_0194768	documentation station l. c. d.
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0044727_0045175	um this will also be uh beneficial to the design of the remote
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0184323_0184706	so audio signal should be possible as well
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0143035_0143275	but obviously the board tends to disagree
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0164005_0164236	that just is the numbers yeah
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0034874_0035285	um they like to use new f new functions
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0146664_0146971	it think it'd definitely be a bad idea not to include teletext
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0149725_0150587	if we uh make a c a button ex for example for big supplements which is instantly on the remote control
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0142419_0142809	volume selection power and teletext
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0148948_0149123	make that um
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0026467_0026733	um in addition remote we're not very functional
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0073217_0074145	uh like uh the on off button uh sound uh i don't know um and um here you got uh s kind of uh display
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0024753_0024963	fi uh seventy five percent of the um
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0116878_0117215	let's have uh discussion on the control functions
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0144197_0144587	um can be a function as well
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0159304_0159450	there are other ways too
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0051958_0052436	mostly people in the age of sixteen to twenty five
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0159649_0160168	the sony telephone and the scroll button which is very useful in serving names or
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0010914_0011288	there's our cost money again
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0056775_0057117	um f for uh the technical f functions uh of of it
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0126970_0127577	or just the remote which is suitable for the market we want a reach because it is forty percent of the market
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0046539_0046695	they shouldn't break down easily
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0139830_0140726	our design for uh uh younger people uh so maybe we can focus ourselves on the elderly people
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0132456_0132604	so let's try it
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0065128_0065479	um yeah
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0018794_0019337	just maybe it's easy if you um yeah i think you will tell it in your presentation as well
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0012339_0012853	so it should be over in a in a well couple of days
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0138722_0139011	yeah i simply think um
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0006370_0006777	okay so this is our second meeting
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0090130_0090669	uh and then we uh will have a little discussion about the requirements and uh design
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0022556_0022822	we had one hundred of these uh test subjects
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0136073_0136281	the the elderly mobile phone
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0206842_0207000	so 'kay
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0056028_0056139	uh okay uh
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0152064_0152168	um
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0166167_0166497	um having a few buttons as possible
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0186523_0186974	the i um i think we'll have to choose between the docking station or the screen 'cause
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0043379_0043672	besides of course that the remote must look very nice
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0138068_0138346	change our focus on the project and i think
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0160326_0160525	that is true but um
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0099441_0099841	um i think we should focus on aspects the design and the user interface
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0041757_0042217	um this is certainly something to take into account
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0084251_0084427	oh i i don't think so
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0202427_0202807	uh think that would be um if we should do something like that it would be
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0167813_0168082	uh i think it's very important in the in the design
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0129558_0129973	and besides that they're not very critical so i mean they don't really care
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0191464_0191584	is this small screen
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0171766_0172184	so i think it would be very hard to actually gain on the competition here
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0158984_0159154	or a joystick like
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0192941_0193270	uh think that should be possible as well
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0113257_0113682	because he was uh aiming on the the younger persons
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0078648_0078763	yeah oh
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0210596_0210808	uh okay
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0036524_0036731	they're not really very interested in features
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0156251_0156713	so we can't s we can skip the uh display so uh we don't need it
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0007276_0007726	uh now we're going um into the functional design
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0054992_0055160	the uh to the second
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0047164_0047851	then as mo as a lot of people indicated that there um remote got lost in the room it might be
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0152324_0152617	functionality should be few buttons you said
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0177403_0177504	because it's gonna be
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0175939_0176153	but i don't think we should spend very much time in that
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0188928_0189068	which would tell you what it does
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0122133_0122543	so i think it's pretty dumb to put no teletext feature on it
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0069903_0070183	the personal uh preferences um
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0157258_0157508	think if you're gonna include teletext you do
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0025097_0025633	people questioned w uh indicated that they thought their remote were o was ugly
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0132822_0132961	uh think that would be the case in a
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0123298_0123436	um
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0093999_0094301	the t. v. switch is to the frequency or the function it is
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0036731_0036997	but they do tend to spend their money a lot easier
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0052805_0053574	this would also greatly increase the production costs but i think these are just some small factors we could consider
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0144587_0144776	but only if uh if it's don't
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0083042_0083237	that was uh mine uh part of it
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0049890_0050392	and in addition to this it could um recharge the batteries in the remote if you put it in
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0057571_0057860	we could out um plenty of time so
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0087816_0088287	uh f twenty uh euros or a less uh
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0130070_0130315	what the remote control is like
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0082268_0082577	so um
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0012853_0013438	it's going to be called anyway so i don't think you're gonna need it
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0026733_0027332	 fifty percent of the people indicated that they only lu used about ten percent of the buttons on a remote control
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0078034_0078621	so uh you you never uh got uh all the buttons uh on one one device
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0208209_0208360	in different languages is you uh
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0030335_0030700	most um important functions of a remote control
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0136509_0136610	you haven't heard of it
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0154417_0154858	but i mean it if it's only for t. v. you're not gonna need a lot of buttons anyway
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0145903_0146395	but um deaf people need uh teletext for uh for supplements
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0173197_0173663	one of the arguments to make it only for the t. v. because we didn't have the time to market a lot
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0015365_0015769	so uh i suggest we take about seven minutes per presentation
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0040047_0040342	um this would be a we would have to make a fancy design
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0187166_0187291	it will be too much as well
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0021426_0022302	we have we uh had been doing research in a usability lab where we observed um users operating remote controls
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0020965_0021091	but you already knew that
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0214385_0214656	and i think we have a lunch break now
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0046162_0046539	because they're used most and so they should be robust
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0180192_0180428	yeah i think maybe we should do some research into
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0078621_0079045	so uh that's uh mine uh idea about it
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0022302_0022556	uh we let them fit out a questionnaire
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0105824_0106739	um that's we've uh got to design um remote which is only suitable for t. v.
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0079045_0079323	um yeah and
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0016439_0017291	and then the decision on the control functions uh which we wanna include and those which we don't wanna include
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0185920_0186591	um i don't know if that will rise the cost too much because
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0118933_0119896	yeah 'cause you're you're saying that teletext is gonna be an old feature and it's not gonna be used anymore anyway pretty soon
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0054103_0054516	so anybody have um any questions until now
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0044041_0044727	as a lot of people indicated they only used about ten percent of the buttons i think we should make very few buttons
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0153532_0153701	so to keep it simple
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0096802_0097017	the power source
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0124958_0125107	stand remote
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0173800_0174434	so you should just we could better um focus on for example the docking station
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0086683_0086961	uh you got uh yeah quite and uh
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0191519_0191635	that would fit into the
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0042921_0043379	so these are two factors that i think should be included in the design
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0034414_0034874	the main characteristic of this group is that they're very critical under a remote control
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0171006_0171553	there's not a lot of functions required so most existing remote controls simply don't have a lot of buttons either
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0005751_0006002	everybody found this place again
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0095206_0095983	when the user presses a button a signal got sent goes to the led and transmitted transmi transmit it's to the t. v.
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0088539_0088654	that's nice
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0154858_0155329	you need the one to zero button next channel previous channel
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0051711_0051826	this was um
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0196037_0196280	and detailed materials
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0017947_0018134	um who wants to be first
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0110183_0110739	um internet is also mentioned just to go in a function we can use
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0013438_0013584	then our agenda
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0057117_0057273	the um
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0203379_0203681	and i think i think there would be a good market for it
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0108096_0108600	uh another point is we have to skip the teletext
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0183188_0183919	you have it on yeah yeah you have it some some phones too which have a docking station
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0029664_0029867	the power button cost a nine
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0014036_0014375	uh you're going to have a presentation
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0154391_0154617	if it's only for television yeah
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0100488_0101105	and uh you only have to design a remote once and if you use high tech materials it comes back in every product
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0199316_0199966	because are we talking about elderly elderly people or people from forty to eighty
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0113682_0114200	so we have to find a market which is above forty plus uh but which will suit our
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0096614_0096802	you've got the buttons
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0038600_0038984	um have to focus on the age ages sixteen to forty five
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0043807_0043933	um functionality
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0104177_0104926	okay now i hope everybody has a little bit more inside in the functions we all have and what we're doing right now
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0139312_0139830	uh that the new products we're gonna make uh speci uh specifically designed
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0168763_0169041	and if you have less buttons you can do a lot more with
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0040660_0041614	the results also indicated that um about one quarter of the people questioned thought that the the remote control costed r. s. r. s. i.
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0047962_0048678	and i say it might be because it would um certainly push the uh production costs a lot
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0127660_0128305	and um if you look in hollow uh the whole generation of forty plus
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0018374_0018562	okay
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0190015_0190170	oh just a normal screen
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0030117_0030222	so these are the most
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0103836_0103943	yeah
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0181117_0181259	that's a good point
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0145134_0145705	because i don't know if it will be a lot more money to implement teletext as well but i don't think that will be a problem
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0168193_0168763	you can make a very fancy design w uh with putting the buttons on the right places
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0204248_0204535	and you're talking about sixty two eighty for example
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0152829_0153239	think uh that's very important we have a few buttons
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0130315_0130688	they'll just pretty much take the first thing they see and which looks acceptable
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0119896_0120197	and new t. v. s will have internet access on them
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0185430_0185692	point is the l. c. d. screen
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0170217_0170897	because if you have a b a remote control only to operate a t. v. they're simply not a lot of buttons required
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0151220_0151330	uh that's a good idea
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0009719_0009959	but first this phase
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0067014_0067502	um yeah people uh don't like it uh so um
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0054623_0054829	about functional requirements
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0033214_0033502	then these are the this is the market
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0192427_0192580	exactly a button info
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0020813_0020965	and the market expert
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0182457_0182939	so maybe we should implement the audio signal or something
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0079456_0079706	uh let's see
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0146395_0146506	so it's yeah
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0099094_0099441	keep the inner working simple so it's robust
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0013747_0013911	uh this time i will take the minutes
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0204510_0204648	yeah the really
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0045670_0046162	especially the channel selection and audio uh selection buttons
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0021210_0021426	um i've done some research
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0214794_0214936	so that's a good thing
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0190238_0190469	just a small screen with two
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0189896_0190015	just the l. c. d.
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0179700_0179902	so we're just gonna focus on the extras
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0136552_0136731	very big success
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0134196_0134605	people have forty plus i mean they want it to work but
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0157711_0157911	maybe they can use uh
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0031087_0031550	there are the m audio settings video settings and channel settings buttons
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0107878_0108096	so it has to be simple
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0187701_0188355	and we're focussing on elderly people here which tend to have a hard time understanding new devices
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0125241_0125383	yeah i think we can
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0048678_0048985	but it might be a good idea to make a docking station
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0124422_0124559	yeah it's it is
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0056139_0056775	um i've been looking at that uh yeah user interface uh of it
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0068665_0068974	uh keep it uh yeah l like a red button
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0085768_0086683	uh i seem uh w uh something on the internet uh not today but uh a few uh weeks ago
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0023526_0023664	what ages are involved
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0188355_0188928	it might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it which would explain a button if you press it
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0082698_0082833	yeah i
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0176456_0176671	do you think the docking station will
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0208521_0209085	or you have to put a language button in it but that will be a bit unnecessary i think
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0014375_0014502	all of you
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0122736_0122840	and i'm pretty much accustomed to it
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0165328_0165493	or they're they don't have to be a lot
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0156200_0156318	but do you need
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0169161_0170001	that is true but i think there's simply not much to gain on the competition when you when you're making a remote control only for to operate only the t. v.
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0097468_0098059	the chip uh controls the infrared bulb and per perhaps a normal bob
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0006124_0006370	that's nice
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0122956_0123091	except the no teletext
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0028894_0029664	channel selection and volume selection um both got a trend on a scale of one to ten for relevance
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0063317_0064041	so um yeah you c you can put uh a lot of uh functions uh in one um yeah
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0020685_0020813	my name is frank from poland
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0038068_0038336	and think we should make a remote for the future
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0159450_0159649	just look if you look at telephones
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0089605_0089727	that's right
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0116572_0116721	so i should just
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0028533_0028894	then we did some research to do the most relevant functions
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0180531_0180733	what elderly people like to have in a
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0085069_0085648	uh it's just um on uh one colour uh yeah
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0128305_0128992	 fifty plus it it's the the biggest share of the of the whole population now
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0209880_0210323	uh then uh a few small things
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0097017_0097468	and uh when a button gets pressed it's goes to the chip
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0062844_0062948	so um
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0165076_0165328	but i think there won't be very much buttons
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0197688_0197944	so i think we need
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0098558_0099094	well um i think we should use default materials simple plastics
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0150587_0151173	for elderly people that they can think oh i wanna have supplements and push the button and they get the big supplements
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0030927_0031087	that's what i like to call them
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0035285_0035438	but they also are very critical
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0177426_0177604	if it's not too fancy
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0064536_0064638	volume isn't it
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0177261_0177426	it should be possible yes
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0117494_0117796	so is there any discussion possible about the new project requirements
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0130873_0131668	but don't you think that if we make a remote which is uh typically made for this market
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0138501_0138636	we can uh we can sell this
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0083306_0083610	and i mean it has questions about the technical functions
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0081664_0082268	so uh we must keep uh the buttons uh quite s uh simple and quite large
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0011288_0012018	but that means that you c can have uh a little trouble if the little trouble with the articulation that's because of this uh
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0038336_0038480	and this means we would
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0157508_0157740	and i think many people like to use that
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0181642_0181868	you said they easily get lost as well
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0065479_0066318	got um many functions in one uh remote control um but um yeah you can see this is f uh quite simple uh remote control
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0025633_0026285	um and an additional eighty percent indicated that it would spend more money on a fancy looking remote control
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0088287_0088515	so it's possible
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0039082_0039938	uh this also makes up most the biggest part of the market so that would also be where our main profit would be g capable
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0194233_0194469	the few buttons we talked about that
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0165401_0166063	but i don't think i think if you're gonna make a remote control only to operate a t. v. you there's not much you can gain on it
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0098059_0098324	when you press button you can actually see your pressed button
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0144873_0145134	higher the the cost
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0064353_0064588	in one um remote control
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0156654_0157219	but do you need the buttons for one to zero
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0084751_0085069	so um it's uh not uh in a colour or something
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0070183_0070706	use a display for uh special c uh functions uh of the different uh devices
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0189596_0189709	okay it
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0185126_0185279	uh another
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0042217_0042921	and thirty four percent thought that it was hard to learn an n how to operate a new control remote control
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0120197_0120863	but i think if you're targeting people of forty plus the chance that they will have a t. v. with internet access
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0172285_0172393	so we can
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0201135_0201925	if we want um uh protocol that's with uh for example the the telephone for elderly people we can
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0211226_0212102	um what we're going to do for the next meeting is the industrial designer will do the components concept
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0209598_0209880	so that's uh the target
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0013584_0013747	that first the opening
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0035786_0036423	um the users of forty six to sixty five years consi they make up forty percent of the market
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0045327_0045670	uh i think the most frequently used buttons should be emphasised
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0137249_0137872	we don't have to focus on on on the on the design then but on functionality
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0163548_0163860	so perhaps we should stick to the basic layout
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0146597_0146751	so i suggest um
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0161089_0161238	and so you would need like
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0037535_0037811	what i think this indicates for um
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0109601_0110069	and uh it's a function we don't need in our remote control
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0197489_0197688	so it that doesn't really matter
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0207517_0207794	you could i think we n it would be a lot easier to
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0174959_0175210	instead of uh f of less buttons
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0207894_0208113	adapted to different cultures
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0080994_0081294	everybody uh ha have to use it so
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0131668_0132456	that people think from the people thing that's the the device i've looked for all though i didn't realise it
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0019337_0019787	just which function you have and where are you gonna talk about
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0125551_0126238	and i think we can do a lot with the um design and the simple buttons which are also mentioned
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0120976_0121278	within the next like twenty years it's very slim
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0057462_0057571	yeah you can take your time
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0080395_0080994	we better ca um uh use uh quite large buttons uh for um yeah
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0094811_0095206	it's got constructive disks for every button
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0024460_0024753	um remote be being considered ugly
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0183158_0183548	like with your key change if you whistle it goes and it makes a sound
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0205344_0205642	and different cultures
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0088968_0089266	but the it wouldn't be very robust
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0075919_0076452	and um you got here a real buttons for uh selecting uh a device
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0006777_0007100	and uh still failing
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0099841_0100301	because if you're going to use high tech materials the price is going to go sky high
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0124320_0124873	but i mean if i s if i see this it's i think i'm just gonna go for another
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0006002_0006124	yeah
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0062113_0062844	uh so um you got a lot of dif uh devices like uh d. v. d. uh uh television uh stereo
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0202051_0202252	target the real elderly people
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0134753_0134976	that's l as soon as it works it's okay with them
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0207058_0207517	and with uh the little screen in it with it which explains a buttons
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0210808_0211226	uh i will put the minutes in the project uh project documents folder
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0048985_0049629	um this would could get a button in it which would signal to the remote which would then beep
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0084427_0084751	uh you got uh quite uh cheap uh dutch green
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0130770_0131353	okay then i just choose for the battery
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0002425_0002837	there's our third meeting already
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0174291_0174398	let's see you like a c
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0184486_0184687	so um let's
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0074312_0074615	um it's uh most uh
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0149655_0150094	well now i think it we should just we should then just design one um
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0081673_0082321	um for the energy source we can use a basic battery or uh as an optional thing
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0227452_0227764	and then i guess we'll start in thirty minutes again
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0009600_0009800	we have about forty minutes
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0065300_0065977	yeah and we have to keep in uh general buttons uh so um we've got um the buttons we have to use
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0024509_0024960	um most important thing is the fancy design
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0171773_0172086	especially if they have the same writings on it
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0172641_0173234	can't we make uh can't we make a remote which you can flip over and use
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0128122_0128372	so that brings us back to the energy
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0024960_0025462	um the research indicated that that was by far the most important factor
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0203714_0204151	and to put um the buttons for um
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0196328_0196430	so oh
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0029507_0029830	okay these are some more group specific findings
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0181069_0181520	because the plus and the min will be optional and all kinds of
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0226173_0226653	ah it's it's here for
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0139515_0140064	it's a lot more difficult to to handle and to to get into the right shape
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0039958_0040170	so it would be kinda more telephone shaped
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0201075_0201425	uh to make this side um like mm
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0110186_0110964	but i think it's um more efficient and cheaper to put it in the docking station
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0089554_0089817	but depends on what we want
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0003961_0004309	presentation three
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0143261_0143413	and you can sell the cases
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0053794_0053930	um yeah and
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0079471_0079573	um that is it
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0199283_0200043	um maybe it's possible to uh make this side like um let's see
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0158991_0159180	and you can just yeah the click it in
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0182100_0182349	maybe you should yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0108773_0109157	so maybe a docking station will help them give the remote a place
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0120250_0120970	and on top of that the l. c. d. screen would um help in making the remote control easier to use
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0121791_0121961	now i think that's a good point
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0130356_0130466	and the cheapest cheaper
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0075199_0076041	so uh um and uh special uh button for shifting up uh and uh shifting down uh channel
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0195514_0195759	because it's a bit it has a bit of a angle
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0206592_0206761	and then flip it upside down
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0111626_0112214	and then we can we can still use the voice recognition but maybe then for only the the channels
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0046820_0047237	uh some uh research uh about um designing of uh interface
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0137033_0137275	look i've got another remote control and uh
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0203157_0203536	so uh it's poss um yeah for so so and
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0053386_0053794	um uh let's see
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0061666_0061790	um
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0220198_0220771	but you're going to get your instructions i think sent that by the coach
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0186534_0186785	because that's the basis you're building on
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0212509_0213175	yeah and then we can have a little bit all here and here maybe
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0139459_0139560	probably not
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0061035_0061248	uh and uh yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0095554_0096021	it think we can talk about the energy source since that's um
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0206339_0206592	if you can have this one you turn it like this
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0144813_0145796	because that's uh it's something extras it's something other remotes don't have which we can get a great advantage point
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0185783_0185988	and one another uh another way
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0151853_0152059	think that's a good uh good option
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0137188_0137359	oh i don't know
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0183799_0183930	yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0158787_0158889	well are we decide it
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0048681_0049088	uh to do in uh the our design
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0049675_0050406	um the uh i found some uh something about uh speech uh recognition
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0139212_0139515	uh i think so because yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0046417_0046820	um 'kay um yeah that's it
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0047237_0047969	um yeah uh last meeting uh we had uh about um uh using a f few buttons
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0103372_0103559	get great popularity for our product
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0018267_0018452	good luck
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0060394_0060972	you can uh just give a sign uh say um sound off or
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0098719_0099113	you don't wanna swing before you can watch television
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0031200_0031633	the material for older people
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0180434_0180553	it's the plus and the min
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0079633_0079787	uh thank you
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0177270_0177482	here is a little l. c. d. screen
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0186194_0186534	and think we should start by by choosing a case
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0156003_0156236	doesn't really matter for the price or the functionality
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0089817_0090047	it think we should disc discuss that
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0121214_0121773	and i think a voice recognition function would not make the remote control much easier to use
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0033107_0033520	um this leads us to some personal preferences
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0004309_0004844	okay this is um the second phase uh we're going to discuss today
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0213608_0213958	and then uh the rest of the buttons over here
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0107490_0107720	that is true
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0020995_0021224	um we've done some market research
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0160188_0160709	um maybe we can make a little drawing of it and uh
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0009911_0010221	uh so i suggest let's get started
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0098436_0098719	but i don't think that's really an option
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0042533_0042730	people with less means
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0015611_0015755	the maybe we can uh work it out
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0166715_0167669	and on the o uh other um uh n uh the on other side uh buttons for uh shifting uh uh for for the sound
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0033520_0033933	uh the remote control and the docking station should uh blend in in the
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0090047_0090706	um for the case uh the supplement and the buttons really depends on the designer
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0008404_0008621	then we have th three presentations
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0153151_0153312	could you explain that a little more
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0012469_0012758	the requirements and the target market
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0091621_0091739	okay
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0101923_0102499	and besides that you mention it would make the docking station obsolete
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0051584_0052263	um yeah just um we have just to focus on the primary um functions
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0112333_0112954	um wondering um what will the voice recognition mean for the production price
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0009142_0009383	how are we going to make it
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0193316_0193600	so th those are the three options we have
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0185566_0185783	make it a l a bit more fancy
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0226788_0227235	so if you wanna uh have a look at it it's over there in the project folder
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0224481_0224778	so that's uh basically it
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0044059_0044222	yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0219286_0219527	and product evaluation
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0174621_0174748	uh blank one
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0071219_0071824	just um we can't put uh on off button uh over here in this uh corner
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0006622_0007580	um these are hopefully the points you addressed in uh your pre uh presentations you're going to show me in a few minutes
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0005162_0006095	and uh a few points of interest in this meeting um are the conceptual specification of components
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0138925_0139061	oh i don't know
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0137803_0138136	so it wouldn't actually have to be wood if it's just
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0201850_0202217	uh bit like so um in the form of your hand
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0059078_0059315	so uh uh yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0050406_0050725	so maybe uh we can uh use uh that
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0088725_0088913	the form should follow function overall
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0083360_0083601	so i don't think it's really an option
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0141930_0142143	maybe it's possible uh possibility
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0129126_0129227	um
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0165829_0166715	it's possible to um programme it's so uh you got on the left side uh on on the right side uh buttons for shifting up up and shifting now
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0057459_0058127	it's uh possible to uh y uh to make um quite cheap uh system for uh speech uh recognition
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0177772_0178107	uh now i have to think
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0204961_0205386	but i think it's better to put the screen uh on top
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0077623_0078316	so um and uh other func functions for sub title uh one bit and uh for sound um
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0151424_0151767	so everybody is okay with the changing covers
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0043838_0043943	um oh
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0097798_0097992	yes w there there are four options
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0196767_0197266	uh you got a curves over um i believe here
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0061248_0061666	television uh put a sou of uh put a sound off uh
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0130590_0130714	and that's the best choice
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0100902_0101010	okay
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0167669_0167929	or or isn't it
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0034226_0034797	um so this would be no uh eye catching designs
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0174029_0174194	then you have to
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0012177_0012469	uh these are the points um we agreed on
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0123848_0123971	so pretty large
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0038550_0039085	this is not really this is pretty much a new shape to uh older people
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0082829_0083360	but if we s choose for that option the docking station would c become obsolete
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0074788_0075199	yeah the place where people uh most often n look at it
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0004844_0005162	that's the conceptual design meeting
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0154727_0154954	and would single curve and double curved mean
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0194709_0195514	uh so that the elderly people can uh use a remote control and at the same time look easily at the screen
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0006125_0006409	uh conceptual specification of design
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0105280_0105864	okay but uh i won't use uh much a energy uh i i believe
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0050939_0051241	uh yeah and uh using a little uh display
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0159369_0159722	um so the interface
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0110964_0111441	so you have a but button on your docking station which you can push and then it starts beeping
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0078471_0079304	yeah and the overall design um yeah we have to discuss about it it uh i think uh so uh the form of it so
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0202695_0203157	so so the remote control have to uh lay in your hands
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0205911_0206150	yeah but this place um
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0063253_0064204	um double push push um of double click um is uh you get the big uh supplements for uh people uh
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0094506_0094825	so these are the points we have to discuss
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0133455_0134119	um which brings us a little bit back to marketing as well
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0148357_0148770	so you suggest we should design two different telephones
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0113733_0114557	because in our earlier um market research if you'd allow me to go to the flat board smartboard
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0100360_0100754	well you b you basically shake your remote and then it powers up
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0161537_0162139	uh we can just uh use the regular form of it but it's um not quite uh fancy s
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0162457_0163200	um you t uh said you wanted to put the um changing channels button on the right side so you can
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0164156_0164342	so that would be great for that
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0062754_0063187	uh one push on the button uh you get uh s uh small uh supplements
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0207042_0207490	because uh maybe your hand is in the way if you have to display here
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0197849_0197953	now
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0084583_0084859	it's really up to the design that we're gonna use
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0103844_0104007	um
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0113083_0113198	that's uh good point
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0034797_0035557	just keep it simple and well the docking station and the small screen would be our main point of interest
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0036393_0036896	so this would be very important that we in at least include these features
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0211725_0211875	life minutes no
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0030102_0030533	uh they like recognisable shapes and familiar material
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0022728_0023525	and i've consulted some additional trend watch trend watchers after the original trend watchers returned about what the
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0183389_0183981	that basic that nobody should have any problems with uh choosing a channel or
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0146887_0147517	because we would have to make one w uh control which would fit in with a wooden cover and uh
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0152494_0153151	um i heard our industrial designer talk about uh flat single and double curved
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0097125_0097927	uh f i think first of all we have to see uh it is possible to introduce kinetic energy in our budget you think
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0182349_0183117	but is it a problem that left handed persons use a different hand
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0041998_0042227	uh the great black colour for uh well
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0003093_0003346	that did anyway
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0198945_0199055	that's uh top
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0157966_0158071	okay
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0190736_0191632	so this type should be better for your or better should prevent repetitive strain injury a bit
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0073271_0073416	so um
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0044222_0044365	okay i'm going to the next one
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0041809_0041998	people with more money
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0151065_0151305	so but that shouldn't be too much of a problem
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0173854_0173980	the mean um
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0069546_0070161	so um made a little uh picture of uh it
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0086677_0087326	and the chip set um it says simple here but it should be advanced because we're using an l. c. d. uh screen
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0071824_0072571	um almost uh ev all uh remote controls uh are used uh b on and off button on the plates
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0154060_0154699	and uh our d manufacturing department can also deliver single curved or double curved ca curved cases
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0171349_0171495	so people can get confused
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0065977_0066608	the on off sound on off sound higher and lower um the numbers uh zero to uh uh nine
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0104423_0105196	yeah you could load up the batteries you could um insert the find the lost remote control f function in there
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0101010_0101706	well personally i don't think that older people like to shake their remote control because they use it
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0188024_0188151	because we got the flat case
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0189358_0189993	the the single curve so i'm not really sure what they're gonna look like but i think it's something like this
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0025510_0026239	um innovation was about half as important as the fancy design
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0213892_0214034	yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0113138_0113402	um i don't have any im information on pricing
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0158525_0158749	on top of the television then
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0223394_0224233	uh i'm not sure if you're going to start right away to work together or i think you're going to fill in the questionnaire first
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0216188_0216423	that's me not s
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0056736_0057079	so uh using uh large large buttons
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0165095_0165355	for a left handed users also
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0076041_0076585	um it's uh on place uh where um the thumb of uh f the
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0139061_0139305	all have to uh research
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0148901_0149184	well i wouldn't design a telephone but
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0026897_0027839	um about half of half is important as the innovativeness was the was easy to use
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0181698_0181813	now that's not gonna work
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0115913_0116369	ask if w they would if people would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0131552_0131947	well there isn't any choice there because we're using the the the display
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0084859_0085347	it's uh doesn't um apply in any technical restrictions
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0049088_0049675	so um finding a t attractive uh way to control uh the remote control
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0118532_0118810	but that would also go for the l. c. d. screen then i guess
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0199055_0199194	so uh this top
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0006409_0006622	and also trend watching
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0158125_0158229	we could go for that
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0147646_0147798	plastic cover
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0068609_0069546	and um we can uh build in a function f which uh shows the channel or som uh which the t television is on
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0200196_0200428	colour yeah okay
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0073538_0074043	the display uh of it uh it's uh just a small display uh for
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0208803_0209030	maybe we should just start on a blank page
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0212281_0212509	here is the display and then buttons
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0092009_0092432	so that brings us to the discussion about our concepts
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0074043_0074312	um we can put it uh on top
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0106811_0107293	so i believe uh one battery uh is just enough
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0108077_0108773	and i don't think they they like uh remote just laying everywhere in their rooms
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0223007_0223394	me neither uh let's see
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0014852_0015611	these are just uh the things we thought of so maybe if you figured something else or thought of something else just let me know
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0021224_0021610	we distributed it some more on cats customers
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0070975_0071219	um yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0204692_0204831	yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0043309_0043495	thank you
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0055076_0055904	so uh it's a like uh speak c uh speech uh recognition and um special button for selecting uh supplements
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0155007_0155622	um it would just only affect the form for as far as i know
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0051241_0051584	so um findings are
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0214673_0214919	and it would prefer the coins to be round
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0198362_0198503	yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0014661_0014791	maybe
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0011051_0011182	everything fine
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0002126_0002271	okay
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0117392_0117667	it would greatly advise not to do it
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0197400_0197849	so um you want to put uh display over here
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0030533_0031093	and our survey says have indicated that especially wood is is pretty much
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0029830_0030102	uh the older people prefer dark colours
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0198688_0199153	do you have it upside down or do you have it a less that's top
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0157846_0157967	now just to lay down
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0098483_0098778	okay no
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0002271_0002425	uh good afternoon
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0123063_0123744	um well this was for like an l. c. d. screen like you would have on a on the the most advanced mobile phones
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0109369_0110186	um you can introduce voice recognition by uh finding back your remote
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0143794_0144768	because um then you can activate it as well with the give your grandfather a new case for his remote control or whatever
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0114265_0114438	yeah sure
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0159722_0160048	what type of interface do we want to use
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0173572_0173789	functions as the normal one
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0185192_0185365	um but maybe we have to
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0204286_0204620	changing uh the channel uh over here uh
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0132127_0132465	okay that's yeah that's the front s chip
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0014137_0014661	um does somebody have any comments on these requirements
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0087418_0088026	and as um the trend watch uh presentation showed uh people like wood
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0064328_0064965	um uh which can uh for we can uh read small uh supplements
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0018191_0018300	hello then
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0210636_0210838	is this the curve
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0188973_0189358	it's from the side so this is rather normal
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0056340_0056736	um and yeah over all um user friendly
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0119311_0119924	um well this is yeah but this is here the question is would you prefer it
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0037901_0038470	so you could imagine that uh the remote control would be standing upright in the docking station
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0148893_0149830	on which you can apply yeah remote controls on which you can apply different case covers for example
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0058127_0059078	um you can't think about um uh when you lost your um remote control you can uh call it in um it's gives a s an uh sync signal
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0115058_0115235	um so it was opened here
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0213175_0213421	just that's for left hand and right hand users
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0034045_0034226	in the room
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0134908_0135723	um as we saw there is not yeah wood is a lot more expensive to produce
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0009383_0009600	and then we're closing
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0182131_0182236	um
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0018027_0018191	shower
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0064965_0065167	so uh um
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0214034_0214463	but um the on off button um still on the top uh yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0181982_0182100	that i guess
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0158050_0158416	and the the cover of the the docking station is also
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0168681_0169252	yeah use a bit yeah ease of use will be a lot more difficult than that it's
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0193623_0193828	okay
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0168075_0168721	yeah we could do that but i'm not sure if that would be very good for the easy ease of use
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0195876_0196040	do you say this um
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0163200_0164156	so your thumb would be easily well that i think that's a very good point 'cause i pointed out earlier that lot of remotes cost r. s. i.
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0165067_0165324	for uh oh for the yeah yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0083687_0084583	uh for the casing uh the uh manufacturing department can deliver uh a flat casing single or double curved casing
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0008215_0008404	uh first the opening
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0055904_0056247	just uh what we uh mentioned uh l last um meeting
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0011480_0012177	then a little uh thing about the last meeting
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0116827_0117229	so if that would increase the price for which we're selling our remote control
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0207652_0208185	it's more logical to have it on top as well because like on your mobile phone it's always above
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0094960_0095318	um first
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0102499_0103267	and i think our docking station could be one of the marketing issues with which we could um
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0156264_0156539	so we can pretty much just do whatever we want
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0090706_0091523	and the chip set um really should be advanced because otherwise uh it would really be a simple uh remote control
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0171151_0171349	but you have extra buttons
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0145959_0146145	black and grey other colours as well
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0157441_0157677	it's that has to be possible to stand up
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0100075_0100370	and how exactly does the kinetic energy work
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0008621_0009142	uh after that we have to come to a decision on remote control concepts
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0201670_0201850	the right colour
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0104066_0104374	yeah it's for for l uh loading up up uh the batteries but
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0157677_0157912	or just only to light down
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0041314_0041809	the wood like for the more uh exclusive people
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0119924_0120250	so that doesn't really mean they wouldn't pay extra for it
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0207905_0208061	there so
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0180861_0181069	now it's not very handy i think
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0088026_0088725	but it raises the price and it doesn't really fit the image unless we would start to product lines
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0184589_0184712	yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0193828_0194709	actually just um the single curve because maybe the curve is pretty good to put the the screen in
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0191855_0192274	and the double curved looks something like this i guess
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0047969_0048534	so uh um uh that's what uh what i want to uh
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0003346_0003602	um let's see
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0184179_0184486	it's just um u using a your thumb
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0172236_0172417	see um yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0126889_0127431	because it will increase cost uh significantly uh significantly
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0128372_0129126	if we don't have voice recognition it will it won't use a lot of energy to use
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0156932_0157318	uh but the form has to be um it has to
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0220854_0221642	so just um i will put these um minutes on the in the folder
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0086341_0086677	uh for the bu buttons we can use plastic or rubber
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0184460_0184589	yeah yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0150237_0150867	one remote but it would have to be fancy with either the wood cover or the plastic one
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0017532_0018012	so should we keep the same uh lined up as uh last time
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0203461_0203581	so i get your most
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0225026_0225240	and you can save this one in the
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0039085_0039958	so they would prefer uh a design where the remote control just lies flat in the docking station
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0096165_0096908	has a pretty big influence on production price uh and image
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0085424_0086153	uh as a case supplement we could um i thought of that l later uh a rubber uh built like uh anti strip
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0147798_0148153	the more original one or the more standard one
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0161144_0161381	that's some of my ideas for a form or
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0010221_0010747	uh did someone encounter any problems during the preparation
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0082321_0082829	uh kinetic energy like in a watch which you just shake and it produces energy
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0002837_0003093	uh i hope you enjoy your lunch
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0218081_0218575	it's important that the corporate design image uh is going to be in the remote
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0218575_0218819	so check out the corporate website maybe
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0156412_0156537	pick one you like yes
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0214360_0214498	yeah still here
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0208901_0209288	let's just try and try it so then we get
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0109241_0109369	and also what you said
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0015844_0016334	and we're going to target the sixty two to eighty euro customers
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0105864_0106811	uh it's uh just a small display so i believe uh it will run on one battery for um six months or more
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0205563_0206339	so it just flip it hundred and eighty degrees around then you get uh that's about here
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0062107_0062754	it was thinking about a special uh button for uh supplements um just one button to keep it uh simple
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0175068_0175292	um then you get
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0013769_0013987	and we are going to use default materials
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0163183_0163295	yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0170713_0170940	because it could be made all symbolic and stuff
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0016511_0017402	so now nobody knows what we're do uh doing um i suggest let's get started with the presentations
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0099261_0099667	but not every room is very light so it's not a very good option
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0043495_0043736	in the questions about uh the trends
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0226653_0226788	smartboard there it is
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0138617_0138850	but wood colour was a lot more expensive
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0219527_0220198	so the industrial designer and user interface designer are going to work together on this one
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0066722_0067499	um and the general button n more ergonomic one button for shifting up um shifting down uh channel
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0113402_0113632	so i'll have to ask the manufacturing department
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0023685_0024088	the best design would be
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0215121_0215344	it's a bit more bit more friendly uh
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0167860_0167985	um well that could
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0020397_0020995	okay i'm uh gonna inform you about the trend watching i've done over the past few days
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0184712_0184961	it think we could just uh leave it in the normal shape
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0198503_0198945	uh we can make it um mm
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0145395_0145574	yeah b that is true
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0076721_0077038	so you you can uh easily shift up or shift down
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0155622_0156003	so it's really just up to the design department what we're gonna use
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0206838_0207060	but is it i don't know um
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0096908_0097011	uh so
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0152388_0152555	changing case covers
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0224233_0224361	and then you'll get the message
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0215759_0215951	supplements
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0107399_0108077	yeah well i think uh elderly people just like to have everything in place
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0133009_0133455	and then we get to the point of the case
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0216954_0217512	we've got a general idea of the concepts and the materials we're going to use
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0097992_0098273	we could use the basic normal battery
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0187176_0187445	so i could draw them out
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0035557_0036270	because this would be the these would uh be the innovative in the remote control
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0024088_0024509	um okay these are some overall findings
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0081438_0081673	about the components design
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0160901_0161144	on the b the board
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0118947_0119165	it's a bit higher percentage but
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0117667_0118175	and i think that would be better to uh insert in our other product that is meant for the
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0125507_0125757	so if you don't want the use it you just don't use it
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0140079_0140497	uh is it possible uh to make um a changeable uh case
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0159180_0159369	that's okay
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0204831_0204961	that's a good one
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0043097_0043203	that would be all
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0131947_0132100	so it's gotta be advanced
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0164342_0164900	um i thought maybe we could just make one of those buttons on both the left and the right side
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0143413_0143544	yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0088970_0089554	um well the kinetic energy source is rather fancy
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0050725_0050931	um
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0131353_0131484	that brings us to the chip
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0026239_0026776	by innovative this means um functions which are not featured in other remote controls
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0115361_0115594	um we also um
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0143544_0143794	think that's a very good option
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0153341_0154060	well the the the general like most older remotes are flat just straight
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0187144_0187404	um yeah just
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0124348_0125054	uh i personally think the l. c. d. screen we wanna use with the extra information i think nobody has anything against it
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0167654_0167860	for the volume
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0205460_0205644	uh
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0072571_0073271	um so uh people uh will uh recognise uh um the buttons
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0116369_0116827	well you can see here our target group would not do that
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0098273_0098436	uh a hand dynamo
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0218891_0219286	the user interface design is the same story
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0134119_0134652	uh if we wanna choose for wood or the black and grey
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0145796_0145959	so and then you can make 'em with colour
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0183117_0183262	uh i think the functions are
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0217512_0218081	so now for the next meeting uh we'll have to look at the look and feel design
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0141783_0141896	change the cases
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0100516_0100747	you use it and it works
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0224778_0225026	maybe this will
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0125054_0125507	because it's just uh some extra information and it's easy to ignore as well
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0146246_0146670	we would have to look carefully into the design though
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0137139_0137803	well and i think the most important factor there is the wooden colour
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0127431_0127946	and i don't think the i don't think it will be a lot easier to use as well
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0186691_0186832	yeah yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0077038_0077404	um so uh quite uh
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0099113_0099261	uh solar cells
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0007708_0008215	um but first i'll show you the agenda
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0172417_0172825	or are we have to make uh a left uh for lefty and
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0004211_0004450	our fourth and last meeting
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0066433_0066604	the colours
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0204416_0204530	it's techniques
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0100114_0100440	and the regular chip is not possible
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0242384_0242889	oh then i think we can have our little celebration right now
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0232648_0232759	do we
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0104040_0104203	that's a big advantage
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0161584_0161756	the shape look and feel
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0206702_0206819	did it work out
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0164998_0165536	if our company is if it is easily recognisable that our company made it
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0003551_0003665	starts at three o'clock
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0073789_0074535	that's right but what's the big advantage of our remote then
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0220688_0220894	uh yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0076774_0076876	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0078253_0078439	we we could save money on it
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0247833_0248137	export is picture i think
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0177373_0177514	oh i had them broken out
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0225853_0226438	and then w it facilitates the score and you can get one yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0147297_0147426	that is not familiar for them
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0063497_0063747	so and it's good for the design as well
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0166741_0167260	oh i have to say this was a little hard because is the minutes of our last meeting
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0185657_0185820	uh in the slogan of the company
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0150380_0150789	and it's uh it's less frightening i think
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0172308_0172577	that's a bit dutchy
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0074539_0074689	only the docking station i guess
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0195915_0196020	okay
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0003665_0004211	uh uh let me see
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0028364_0028914	but uh i think these are altogether quite a uh quite a few buttons
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0013106_0013608	then we would do the project uh evaluation and the closing after that
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0108779_0109349	the remote with with they expect to have like ten buttons for the numbers one to zero
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0153754_0153939	uh yes they are
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0045420_0046093	if we see i don't know if i filled in correctly so just correct me if you see uh something wrong
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0218865_0219036	let's yeah must be
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0235536_0235728	well that was it
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0221144_0221348	so you can yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0059766_0060016	well i think actually there are two buttons and uh
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0168714_0169001	is the design fancy on a scale of one to seven
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0210551_0210773	the digital the digital pen is very nice
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0051892_0052253	but then the biggest costs are the buttons
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0018533_0019006	then there's the zero to w one to zero buttons
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0156703_0156972	that was the the point i forgot
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0111584_0111738	just make it real simple
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0047771_0047964	so there's not much to uh
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0131840_0132737	but uh you can make a f quite a big uh remote control for uh just the same price as a small one
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0187904_0188353	thought we would have another private thingy after this
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0134149_0134440	and the case is come right out of the machine
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0047159_0047280	okay
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0242558_0242728	but
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0076079_0076247	maybe we should move to a different supplier
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0238789_0239421	you can you can change markets uh by changing the front cover
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0067814_0068508	so uh you still got four buttons but just um so
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0011128_0011851	uh we have to see if everything we wanna do is also possible within our budget
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0047280_0047569	that's two euros off
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0176928_0177045	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0143629_0144030	uh think it was better to have this price just uh bit earlier
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0250942_0251380	that somebody see the project folder
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0121515_0121659	and these are two buttons then
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0032014_0032295	so we could cancel that one
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0106263_0106706	what if you have to scroll to page eighty eight
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0219865_0219973	uh network
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0236226_0236421	if we gonna export this product
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0116703_0116970	looks a bit old maybe
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0010847_0011128	then we will look at the finance
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0133154_0133380	so uh it's a bit uh
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0213811_0214110	the flip over or a more precise uh
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0119389_0119627	then yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0211792_0211923	oh
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0090976_0091606	or we can leave out the ten buttons and take one scroll wheel for the programme numbers
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0152829_0152952	that's alright
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0256144_0256292	summary of the project
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0197969_0198284	did we move through the right faces you think
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0151805_0151906	only five buttons
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0014313_0014458	but first um
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0047569_0047771	we need the advanced chip
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0054504_0054640	sixteen i believe so
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0213286_0213663	so you rather want it to have a flip over
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0204985_0205092	innovative access
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0010431_0010847	then we will set up some evaluation cur uh criteria
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0093381_0093674	well we're getting close
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0016318_0016630	the default spot for the on off button
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0155734_0156017	um the project process
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0202182_0202434	yeah that wasn't enough room but the finance uh
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0230837_0231027	because i think
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0060170_0060336	but um
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0197629_0197803	thank you
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0070564_0070849	but i think this really is for buttons anyway
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0106239_0106387	think that's the case on most
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0046788_0046989	then we can just w oh on
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0201997_0202171	because of the finance sheet
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0162360_0162741	uh literature is a very important factor here
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0075541_0075679	now
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0025260_0025597	so so uh the shifting uh better
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0160310_0160865	okay so i did some literature study um analysis of the requirements we set up earlier
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0170105_0170392	um is the design innovative
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0044103_0044313	and i can tell you
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0050894_0051207	then we have the case material supplement
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0063982_0064253	uh let's see
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0218606_0218760	yeah you can export this as image
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0137000_0137171	richard's accountants was very good
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0134440_0134932	and single curves you have to have a different uh different machine then a flat one
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0079161_0079432	my mother can't even send send an as a message
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0144030_0144412	before we went on to the to the whole design
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0059459_0059638	now those are one i think
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0054498_0054741	because uh sixteen
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0145959_0146152	this will really require a lot of marketing
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0026919_0027039	okay
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0123433_0123820	if you press the volume button you can control the volume with the scroll wheel
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0161756_0161905	innovative
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0025597_0026145	uh for uh yeah sh shifting up in uh on t on ti uh teletext and shifting i don't know
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0245777_0246188	we can put these in the project folder as well
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0098534_0099412	but it would definitely drop cost a lot
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0050630_0050771	think we have to keep that
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0229667_0229875	um any more ideas
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0130623_0130801	you'll get a a much smaller remote
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0048445_0048674	here we have the single curves
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0095856_0096061	until you've got the right number then you push it
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0042160_0042326	so they dump out
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0103711_0104097	yeah but i think that's w that is a big advantage for our
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0127873_0128246	yeah and we can leave the teletext in if we want
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0061647_0061922	it's just uh the environmental of
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0127616_0127873	so we've got one two three
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0125200_0125742	and that will make the use of the scroll wheel uh more obvious indeed
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0054741_0055171	now that will be even more than
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0067733_0067938	it's yeah it's
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0034258_0034430	we dec discussed that already
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0077108_0077625	don't you think we can if we can count this as w as one button
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0171025_0171189	seven
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0092797_0093082	if we have this one and we've got the advanced
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0139381_0139563	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0035660_0035796	well you can't
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0098258_0098523	think that would be like the end of our usability
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0044514_0045184	that we're going to have a pretty hard time producing this for twelve and a half euros
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0146799_0147297	because if older people like familiar forms and familiar stuff
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0177235_0177373	it costs
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0030312_0030651	and well the on off button it's it's an necessity
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0194299_0194531	that think that's uh pretty nice score
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0148713_0149057	we can let we can stick it out a bit
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0187038_0187139	so there would be this
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0149480_0149709	maybe that's recognisable for them as well
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0002070_0002219	hello
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0232098_0232225	articles within the budget
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0174943_0175151	do we have too many functions
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0005801_0006236	and this meeting we will discuss our final design
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0103751_0103896	so uh
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0016914_0017143	then there's the volume and channel selectors
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0196833_0197091	that brings us to the project evaluation
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0124160_0124291	if you do the same for the channel
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0230035_0230187	or about the product
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0252939_0253373	yeah i just put it in my documents and uh that's okay
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0234146_0234459	uh and i think you can compensate that that's well
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0037127_0037580	if you just make a control for just the t. v. there's just not much to gain here
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0164617_0164998	and regular battery
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0067462_0067814	but i don't don't know if if it's cheaper
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0019665_0020108	so it's rather a simple prototype
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0184632_0184738	well you have the logo there
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0162741_0162952	uh is it functional
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0168408_0168623	oh
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0100879_0101028	you have to
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0163317_0163740	and are the ju those functions that are there are they useful
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0177905_0178276	the they're ugly not f very functional and getting lost
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0021629_0022526	um when you're in teletext there usually are buttons where you just you just press it and you go to the next teletext page
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0165903_0166081	so we're supposed to evaluate it right now
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0169037_0169151	uh i think it's fancy
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0017832_0018459	if you hold it and you press another button uh the help goes to the l. c. d. screen
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0002917_0003189	okay
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0136803_0137008	but then again i mean
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0076329_0076577	that's an option
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0092604_0092797	um let's see
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0068502_0068755	yeah i think they can't uh the materials
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0167947_0168409	it tried to but it's uh it's giving arrows by downloading the software
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0185246_0185657	and they wanna put fashion in their products
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0123125_0123299	and just um
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0051551_0051892	so that's uh not much to say either
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0109635_0109761	with only five buttons on it
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0203638_0203833	and just to be able to access internet then
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0256701_0256986	uh maybe we have to fill uh another questionnaire
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0084979_0085308	but it is possible to make one uh for uh twelve fifty
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0072110_0072807	also the l. c. display i think it's i think it's too expensive for the display we use
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0156462_0156642	and evaluation of the
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0030827_0031305	the volume and channel buttons you've need d you obviously need these dots those
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0042859_0043583	the because we only have thirty minutes left i will move on to the finance part
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0038338_0038707	yeah they're it's rather hard to draw on the white board
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0237812_0238244	it'll be more for the younger people than for the older people
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0161347_0161584	um is it a remote fancy
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0199853_0199991	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0036278_0036567	uh teletext and supplements are yeah that's it
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0031435_0032014	the mute button could be replaced uh by pressing the volume down button twice
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0182391_0182495	how would give it a four
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0012264_0012897	so we have to see if it fits within the twelve and a half euro per remote
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0188610_0188785	is this like after this are we done
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0233184_0233323	that's good point
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0024092_0024492	uh you can use the normal uh one to zero buttons
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0249784_0249996	this is another network i guess
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0239421_0239648	that's one thing you can change it with
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0135087_0135349	uh think this is a really easy one
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0038452_0038595	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0249669_0249784	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0178513_0178770	are the production costs within the pre set limits
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0193462_0193734	that's eighty four percent
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0054091_0054498	so if we let first count the buttons we have now
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0154964_0155070	let's see
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0013608_0013797	you've got forty minutes
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0170912_0171025	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0150789_0151461	if they see this design they think oh they're only five buttons in uh but we will see
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0046513_0046624	since it's rechargeable
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0055171_0055282	at the euros
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0039939_0040252	uh yeah and uh we don't need uh a led or um
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0146322_0146482	to get this to sell
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0112798_0113097	how to use the other bu buttons as supplements
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0089083_0089571	so uh you can stay uh below uh twelve fifty
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0062510_0062891	well i was thinking maybe you could just integrate three of those numbers to one button
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0064253_0064373	if you make this
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0028033_0028364	it just uh few buttons and large buttons
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0184352_0184632	is the company company recognisable
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0048184_0048445	to save there
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0242985_0243121	forty forty per cent
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0008095_0008951	um this uh design detail design meeting uh we will discuss uh the look and feel of the design
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0096599_0096800	instead of a scroll push
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0183036_0183172	uh think i'd go for two
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0052309_0053124	so maybe we really should try to discard some buttons to uh keep our costs low
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0038453_0038660	just a normal plane buttons
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0239648_0240492	so you can also try to uh reach the younger people by uh putting fancy covers on m on the market
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0222551_0222719	having this kind of meetings
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0046275_0046449	but maybe we can also use one
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0041860_0042160	with uh a different colour than the case
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0127182_0127540	plus scroll
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0039654_0039801	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0084537_0084716	the margin will get too small
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0093430_0093535	are we getting closer
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0105892_0106058	but the supplements say there
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0087547_0087698	but we want to make a
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0235728_0236002	 fifteen fifteen eleven
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0238796_0239004	or specifically for younger people
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0112275_0112622	and we can keep our l. c. d. screen which can provide extra information
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0147616_0147830	so we're gonna have to do a lot of convincing them
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0097748_0097915	so you won't need a button
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0170443_0170561	um
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0036435_0036581	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0056221_0056363	oh okay including the help
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0245141_0245441	then we still have some questions
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0156473_0156654	evaluation criteria
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0107692_0108376	but then again there would be that's just pretty much another option for older people who don't even know what a scroll wheel is
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0254638_0255073	think i'm going to make our final presentation now
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0042516_0042770	okay
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0157309_0157416	there we are
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0099412_0099634	and we need the battery
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0041216_0041353	uh so
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0101088_0101291	okay
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0170437_0170685	very
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0087126_0087445	there it is
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0138886_0139061	are i agreeing with the usability
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0149761_0149882	that's a good one
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0122725_0123125	we could wake two buttons out of that
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0041453_0041860	so and for the materials we've just chosen for rubber buttons
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0216688_0217321	or uh uh in shared uh folder or s uh shared directory
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0019412_0019547	and the company logo
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0072807_0073166	uh think they uh tried
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0128498_0128621	so that is five buttons
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0057837_0058157	that saves us uh one euro already
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0106163_0106420	but if you push the uh teletext button twice
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0137087_0137451	all these changes are not really okay with me
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0138097_0138255	actually just go to the board and
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0092155_0092604	then we have five and one
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0133891_0134149	single curve is really easy to just fill in
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0176988_0177147	um we haven't thought of that one
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0010136_0010431	we will have the prototype presentation first
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0059955_0060170	uh it's just one bit
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0075542_0075799	so it's not even taken into the price
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0141234_0141583	it will be necessary to have a good help function as well
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0171691_0172030	should we do an
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0181412_0181585	two too flashy
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0180749_0180961	we have the test it's
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0209665_0209854	or are they too much
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0170510_0170929	think so with our l. c. d. screen docking station scroll buttons
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0041294_0041399	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0222160_0222383	have we found new ideas for
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0210912_0211061	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0106964_0107498	well that could be just the like the scroll to the eight click scroll to eight click scroll to eight click
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0117002_0117143	that's pretty big wheel
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0082453_0083439	indicated that older people spend their money easier more easy maybe it's feasible to just put the price of the remote up a little
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0015791_0016318	well this is what me and richard came up with
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0002296_0002471	good afternoon
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0020108_0020509	and uh we'll have to see from testing uh how the users take it
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0139563_0139867	but um i think we can then keep the single curved one
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0181518_0182034	think a radio button is not exactly what older people expect of a remote control
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0095217_0095416	um scroll
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0174438_0174714	um do we have all functions that we wanted to include
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0101291_0101674	and we can save a euro by a flat design
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0024492_0025251	uh but you can also uh use the um button for uh changing the um the channel
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0037009_0037127	that's what i pointed out earlier
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0187547_0187762	that's also supposed to calculate the score but
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0061278_0061447	uh yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0012941_0013106	but we will see that later
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0114266_0114455	um it's okay
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0021375_0021603	shower uh just pop in at any time
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0090720_0090859	now remote
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0071360_0072110	maybe it is but then it seems to me that it's impossible to get the twelve and a half euros
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0217452_0217617	so yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0029738_0029857	think if you look at
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0219973_0220141	yeah pen is here on the table
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0078998_0079213	yeah that's what i'm wondering
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0205510_0205664	leadership
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0084758_0084993	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0055958_0056074	yeah with a help button
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0215998_0216302	it's easier to uh share it with the other people
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0091895_0092155	because then we save ten buttons
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0214235_0214403	folder is will i think
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0176983_0177301	are there's eye infomors
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0036137_0036278	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0244031_0244644	from the from ending of the oh i think i have one uh
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0233005_0233184	 docking station
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0179974_0180138	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0136204_0136368	it's black what do you think
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0060512_0060809	the w uh two uh for one big battery
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0130525_0130706	yeah yeah you can
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0231500_0231842	then that we get to our last sheet
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0027039_0028033	uh but um i thought in uh few meetings earlier we uh uh tried to keep it uh simple
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0033476_0034076	uh or you can build in uh when you press uh one button uh uh yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0087708_0088326	so uh uh so um uh uh fancy and uh good uh yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0157416_0157698	if evaluation could you uh
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0147923_0148245	but they know the scroll buttons from uh old radios
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0168331_0168504	so
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0061440_0061761	yeah but that's not stated in this file
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0225098_0225564	so uh just like uh like uh at the universal uh
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0095416_0095856	if you scroll you will see the numbers on the l. c. d. display
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0067056_0067164	yes
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0240492_0240596	just as a test
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0236002_0236226	that think we will
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0180917_0181412	th i still i think it's too m too fancy
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0191332_0191499	so that would be minus eight
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0091753_0091862	it's scroll this one
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0106891_0107180	one b uh one but uh a few buttons
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0153182_0153385	now i didn't uh
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0071170_0071360	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0208923_0209034	exactly costs
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0019006_0019210	the button for uh teletext
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0222026_0222160	that's nice
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0145362_0145959	but this is not really like for the group we were making a remote
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0195745_0195915	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0188192_0188302	we've got the calculator
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0115761_0115936	yeah it would put uh
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0209363_0209665	were the means sufficient for the tasks uh that we had to do
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0103324_0103643	yeah or we have to uh skip the supplement uh button
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0171189_0171295	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0155185_0155519	we still have fifty minutes left so we're nice on schedule
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0078439_0078909	but would it make the remote more usable for elderly people
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0203274_0203420	younger users also
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0106899_0107035	uh that's not really nice
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0039712_0039870	just to recognise it so uh
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0083439_0083715	especially since we have those nice features
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0175287_0175410	think it's uh seven
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0100679_0101041	if you want to use an l. c. d. screen you you need an advanced chip yes
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0225682_0225853	so everybody puts his own score
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0236631_0236796	especially in the market
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0161905_0162137	what new functions are there
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0133430_0133891	it's uh it's more the molds in which they are being made i think
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0219371_0219673	so the sharing of the information was uh was okay
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0036581_0036775	so it's rather basic already
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0053124_0053846	because we have to we will have to get the twelve and a half euros at the end
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0244396_0244498	uh i believe uh
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0098570_0098725	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0175844_0175990	oh and do we um
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0104376_0104780	can we use t can we integrate the teletext and the supplements in one button
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0236796_0236996	people are pretty tick it in
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0101994_0102510	that's an option we can then we're almost there
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0235657_0235767	 fifty group
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0094314_0094454	then we will all
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0085521_0085913	if you leave out the l. c. d. display
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0199341_0199442	in the design phase
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0202394_0202519	the room is yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0014580_0015059	we will do the this it prototype presentation
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0112092_0112275	because it saves it saves a lot of money
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0017279_0017651	sample plus minus button
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0037877_0038300	so you had somebody about f into something about the design of the buttons there
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0183365_0183543	then we have to do the three
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0186250_0186526	so i think it's very recognisable
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0255148_0255515	oh yeah you're supposed to make a final
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0189978_0190159	and forty nine
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0145138_0145487	that's pretty different if you saw the last one in this one
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0238244_0238405	so maybe we should just reject it
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0034841_0035336	so uh they just put in uh put press uh the button and uh
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0076670_0076864	something
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0167419_0167947	yeah that because my pen failed to upload his data
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0197803_0197969	project process
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0065854_0066283	looks a bit like uh
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0096800_0097289	okay but then you c you can push uh some other button as well
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0125980_0126440	so we make one for the volume one for the channel
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0087771_0087876	but then w
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0157698_0157938	go ahead
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0226629_0226773	so it's uh
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0068738_0069393	you got uh not not a bet better than itself but um on the um
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0201636_0201997	oh no
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0070476_0070612	but uh no but i think
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0164162_0164617	is the remote really for the group we're making it for
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0212384_0212719	smartboards will be irritating
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0156026_0156394	so um i like set up all these criteria
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0240596_0240780	see you out it works
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0030651_0030827	you can't drop that one
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0177776_0177905	um
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0218219_0218571	it can uh can you export it uh like uh yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0017651_0017832	uh we thought of a help button
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0185820_0186250	and we have the removable front cases
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0086475_0086769	but you can't use uh
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0234586_0235053	so i think that shouldn't be the biggest problem because it's very cheap to make as well
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0209950_0210414	well the smartboard the the the drawing is just a pain in the ass but
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0056577_0056973	uh think we can uh discard the help and the mute button
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0057092_0057577	uh by pressing down volume long or pressing down uh a number
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0104980_0105892	well think it's pretty much the teletext supplements are right now you just push the teletext button go to page eight eight and teletext disappears
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0192588_0192723	round eighty percent
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0174271_0174438	is the design functional
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0138928_0139228	or do some market research and see what the options are
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0093820_0094017	but how would a scroll wheel work here
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0051288_0051551	it's the cheapest one we need
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0015059_0015536	so if some yeah somebody wants to separate forward
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0213663_0213862	or something else
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0072386_0072531	and that's that's a big cost
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0189335_0189567	these are seven factors time seven is forty
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0016630_0016914	the mute button just below that
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0129190_0129350	and make it smaller overall
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0243200_0243641	and i think we still have to fill in one more questionnaire
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0039817_0039922	just for recognition
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0179851_0180014	if think that's a three
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0034076_0034258	but m yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0063046_0063189	that's a possibility as well
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0190699_0190964	one is three that's for
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0005570_0005801	okay this is our last meeting
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0137707_0137976	we have to cut costs
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0155070_0155185	you can sit down i think
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0201139_0201327	sebastian
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0007073_0007473	and then we're going to close the project today as well
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0162952_0163317	are there not too many functions uh a amount of functions
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0147566_0147692	now but i think
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0061761_0062582	so maybe we can we can even make one button with the volume and the channel in one by pressing
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0128575_0129190	if we leave out all those buttons perhaps you can go with the flat flat case
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0073167_0073589	if we leave out the display we can also save money on the chip
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0257455_0257867	and then i'll meet you in i think about ten minutes or something
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0179881_0180054	um yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0128359_0128484	that's m that's better
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0176676_0176833	like it getting lost and
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0139867_0140423	just to express our l. c. d. screen a bit more
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0183543_0183656	it's the
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0103078_0103221	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0192857_0193134	because i'll just type that in and the bottom here
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0180097_0180496	now i think with our new radio button i think it's uh
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0006236_0007073	and we will do some evaluation about the not only the product but also the project
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0188962_0189100	we're gonna go to our other room again
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0146718_0146881	but um
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0153998_0154163	now
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0245441_0245777	it somebody has some questions they can ask 'em now
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0256421_0256688	are we supposed to go into our own rooms again
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0132737_0133154	just uh you only have to pay for the uh double curved or single curve
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0136474_0136803	well i still think we should go for a single curve design
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0188530_0188806	twelve and a half
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0232568_0233023	considering we are not going to make a docking station
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0190245_0190356	uh minus one
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0202986_0203157	and i would have liked to go for the
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0100440_0100541	it has to be advanced
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0069893_0070476	but i think because we have the advanced chip we can just count this as one button
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0058157_0058347	that then we have got fifteen i think
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0208114_0208687	the tasks are very structured so you can just do stuff by step by step and it's very easy
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0088438_0088709	it would not uh it would uh
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0026233_0026456	okay
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0142386_0142553	so this is scroll
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0036894_0037009	think so
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0216302_0216688	uh so uh you can sh save it uh and uh put it on the internet
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0086308_0086824	so oh you can take the single chip
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0075679_0075858	that's extra
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0154128_0154590	but we can go on with the project evaluation
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0258363_0258676	hopefully my pen will download it s software
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0112622_0112798	how to use the scroll wheel
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0158406_0158595	now we've got fifteen minutes but
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0032295_0033198	think the help button really is necessary because there's no other way to know when someone wants to know what a button does
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0144694_0144852	and i'm glad we could make a bit
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0022694_0023520	uh that's just uh the normal uh is t as the normal uh remote controls uh so um
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0148554_0148713	that's right
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0069279_0069434	yeah on the chip there
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0170685_0170912	supplements buttons
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0206916_0207281	also you two view with the last phase
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0160970_0161347	translated it into criteria which would be these
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0060809_0061278	but they are uh more expensive than the small ones
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0002765_0002891	good luck in the trick
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0196020_0196171	so that would be the evaluation
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0233323_0233942	but maybe because of the docking station the price of the remote can also be a little bit higher
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0213865_0214034	the flip is uh easier so
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0217729_0218117	uh you need the smartboard uh application i think
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0085913_0086188	and if you use less buttons
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0083822_0084216	yeah but uh we have to stick to the twelve and a half euros
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0173037_0173279	and i would say four
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0040356_0041216	the s some uh remote controls uh do ha have so but um yeah because we use the little display we don't uh have to use it
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0148690_0148848	so maybe it's uh
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0129520_0130493	so if you put the the volume and channel buttons on the same height as the on off button the screen right b under that then the scroll button
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0138490_0138782	get us to spend eighteen dollars a remote
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0019210_0019412	uh button for the supplements
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0131332_0131599	decides this one to for buttons
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0011851_0012264	because everything costs money and the more functions you want to have the more money it will cost
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0244644_0244766	five more minutes
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0153385_0153583	the costs and the twelve and a half euros
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0069429_0069825	on the chip you got still uh for uh for a button
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0201327_0201462	what's the room for creativity
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0158226_0158339	the five more minutes
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0210871_0211227	if it wants to download this uh data
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0236421_0236631	that's innovative
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0088932_0089083	the attractive uh o option
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0013797_0014313	so we will be finished at half past three
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0074986_0075402	which isn't e the docking station isn't even in this c s c schematic
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0252721_0252875	ah maybe i uh they will save it
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0140423_0141234	so people will use it more and especially for the help functions that will be good if we have scroll bar scroll button
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0119725_0120301	one two three four five buttons if we erase this one
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0179499_0179698	does the design fit the group of focus
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0113870_0114054	if you would erase these
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0104203_0104445	but um it's
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0035930_0036107	leave out the number buttons i guess
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0096146_0096447	that would bring up the price of the scroll wheel also
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0215007_0215998	but if you want to share uh of uh when you make um uh a picture like this uh on the presentation
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0030000_0030312	most controls they've got more buttons than this
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0152952_0153182	that would buy it if i was six
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0029107_0029558	and i'm wondering if we if we really really need all of those buttons
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0043583_0044103	which is pretty exciting to see if it's all possible what we wanna do
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0243778_0243907	uh didn't get a message
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0046449_0046571	uh don't know if this is possible
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0119110_0119389	something like that
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0218259_0218463	but i think you can yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0097381_0097608	you could just not scroll for uh half a second
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0084565_0084675	is it possible to
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0229875_0230035	or questions about the project
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0217264_0217573	yeah i tried to open the file on my laptop but
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0152730_0152944	but you're not sixty
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0221256_0221553	yeah yeah pepe paimpi
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0063208_0063402	that would cut the costs
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0238517_0238789	just put it on the market for everybody
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0255238_0255994	and then i will be back in about ten minutes to show you the final presentation
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0042530_0042672	um uh that's about it
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0079853_0080323	and we can't buy a um a remote control uh when you can't uh use it
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0076864_0077108	polished p
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0008951_0009616	the usability interface design and we will do the product evaluation
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0173214_0173379	yeah yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0184583_0184737	yes it is
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0205664_0206292	was it clear what everybody had to do uh according to their roles and functions
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0094817_0094956	oh maybe you can
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0034430_0034841	but uh we think uh all people uh don't know that uh option
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0023626_0024092	you push it uh you um came in uh page uh one another
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0176201_0176676	take care of the biggest frustrations of the remote control
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0145232_0145362	it's pretty difficult
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0240780_0240960	that's i think a good advantage
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0199522_0199792	so a lack of information about prices
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0149057_0149480	like a old old buttons
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0058928_0059435	uh i assume you count the volume and channel things for two buttons each right
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0157938_0158406	we've got five minutes i think for this criteria
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0089624_0089850	uh i think it's uh difficult as well but
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0237812_0237923	you can do more
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0151436_0151580	but it might be confusing too
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0218463_0218606	it should be possible
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0123989_0124160	so that would save two buttons
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0091765_0091992	that's a
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0102611_0102942	yeah if if you could just leave out one more button
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0106706_0107015	eight hundred eighty eight
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0009616_0010053	um in order to do that we have this agenda
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0235206_0235536	do we think we gonna get the twelve and a half million
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0205333_0205510	okay
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0240919_0241758	yeah i think it then it would be way more uh popular with younger people than it is then it would be with
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0058479_0058604	wouldn't yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0007473_0008027	so after that you'll be uh free to go and spend all your money
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0200381_0200484	oh uh oh
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0152156_0152341	but it's very special so uh
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0124384_0124704	that's really a good good idea i think
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0198676_0199145	think we should have uh should have had the finance thing a lot earlier
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0135571_0136204	but there's everybody think about a flat or a single curved design
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0033873_0034008	long time
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0048674_0049330	uh we can see that the difference between uncurved and single curved is one euro
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0046093_0046275	uh i counted two batteries
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0149952_0150380	so i'm afraid we have to move on
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0096574_0096836	and integrated scroll wheel push button
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0172030_0172181	it's the design easy to use
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0082155_0082340	well since the market research
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0113317_0113870	and it's good for the innovative design as well
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0157564_0157736	thank you
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0152495_0152752	ah would buy it
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0077625_0078335	and integrate the uh these buttons in three then we save a lot of money as well
