kansas01a_785.54_3.22.wav_ASR	it's the walk of walking
kansas01a_796.427_0.34.wav_ASR	yeah
kansas01a_799.188_2.5.wav_ASR	the walking
kansas01a_802.938_5.45.wav_ASR	oh well you don't hafta do it
kansas01a_816.473_0.49.wav_ASR	yeah
kansas01a_858.727_2.98.wav_ASR	you walk in walking
kansas01a_861.862_9.15.wav_ASR	the you walk your walking
kansas01a_872.298_0.39.wav_ASR	yeah
kansas04a_19.317_0.78.wav_ASR	very good
kansas04a_27.196_0.52.wav_ASR	yes
kansas04a_29.341_0.86.wav_ASR	please tell me about it
kansas04a_30.225_7.48.wav_ASR	it's february twenty eighth in ninety eight
kansas04a_42.61_11.38.wav_ASR	well my stroke started on one night and i did not think it was too bad
kansas04a_54.764_1.58.wav_ASR	oh it's hard work work
kansas04a_56.809_9.79.wav_ASR	and then i went out with my friends and they were concerned because i was driving accidentally
kansas04a_68.079_9.21.wav_ASR	he said that i drove too close to cars and i had difficulty with my speech
kansas04a_77.957_5.16.wav_ASR	and i went home and i met my husband at the local watering hole
kansas04a_84.83_3.35.wav_ASR	and hadta drink and i went home
kansas04a_88.529_5.344.wav_ASR	that was not my usual way of doing
kansas04a_95.153_1.87.wav_ASR	don't talk to anybody or anything
kansas04a_97.072_3.29.wav_ASR	and so i went home and i went to bed that night
kansas04a_100.589_2.91.wav_ASR	and i got up the next morning and went to work
kansas04a_104.276_4.63.wav_ASR	went to a or chamber meeting
kansas04a_109.508_10.63.wav_ASR	and i parked and went in and when i came back out i noticed that i parked very badly
kansas04a_121.372_4.48.wav_ASR	and i went to work and then one of the girls came in and said
kansas04a_126.873_2.64.wav_ASR	you're not using your arm correctly
kansas04a_131.007_0.4.wav_ASR	alright
kansas04a_131.688_1.2.wav_ASR	and i think i'm having a stroke
kansas04a_133.315_0.93.wav_ASR	call the doctor
kansas04a_134.744_8.79.wav_ASR	and she told me to go to the emergency room and not to drive
kansas04a_144.096_13.82.wav_ASR	and at that point i was confused enough that i was thinking about the ambulance across the street at home and not one across the street from my office
kansas04a_158.827_1.8.wav_ASR	so i think i'd drive myself
kansas04a_161.92_1.11.wav_ASR	so i drove myself
kansas04a_163.284_3.31.wav_ASR	and i got out there parked in the property
kansas04a_167.312_3.2.wav_ASR	and then i met my husband there
kansas04a_170.986_6.08.wav_ASR	and i told him to tell them what what i thought
kansas04a_177.562_3.58.wav_ASR	because i could not communicate at that point
kansas04a_182.356_4.06.wav_ASR	and i was there for over night and they sent me home
kansas04a_187.406_9.41.wav_ASR	and then i did not feel well the next morning so i i had him take me back to the hospital and i stayed for several weeks
kansas04a_207.011_5.1.wav_ASR	well i had therapy and all my speech and writing
kansas04a_213.604_6.17.wav_ASR	but they didn't give it to me for very long
kansas04a_220.931_5.04.wav_ASR	me i was just when i was in the hospital i had my speech and writing therapy
kansas04a_226.382_3.15.wav_ASR	and then i got home and had some physical therapy
kansas04a_259.052_0.729.wav_ASR	oh she's so beautiful
kansas04a_263.423_8.6.wav_ASR	well when i got married the first time i hadta plan my whole wedding myself because mom was much older
kansas04a_273.102_2.34.wav_ASR	and she left it up to me
kansas04a_276.529_5.33.wav_ASR	and i went home and then went back to london
kansas04a_281.881_3.75.wav_ASR	and i got married in danforth chapel
kansas04a_294.955_9.48.wav_ASR	and we had dinner and then we went to back to the hotel
kansas04a_304.94_3.42.wav_ASR	and my husband married me
kansas04a_309.335_2.86.wav_ASR	he's a magnificent minister
kansas04a_313.018_7.98.wav_ASR	and his wife took over the bathroom didn't get let my sister in there
kansas04a_322.108_15.2.wav_ASR	and so then we went to the chapel and on the way my brother inlaw was driving and he almost wrecked us
kansas04a_342.23_1.91.wav_ASR	oh i think that will be enough of that story
kansas04a_369.621_4.36.wav_ASR	well this little boy is practicing his soccer ball
kansas04a_376.048_2.66.wav_ASR	and then he kicks it through the window
kansas04a_379.812_1.49.wav_ASR	and it breaks the window
kansas04a_382.375_3.03.wav_ASR	and it goes into this man's house
kansas04a_386.256_1.9.wav_ASR	and he's very startled
kansas04a_389.349_6.47.wav_ASR	and he gets up and looks out the window to see where it came from
kansas04a_396.096_10.7.wav_ASR	now it does not tell you whether the boy ran away or whether he came and confessed that he had kicked the soccer ball
kansas04a_435.24_4.79.wav_ASR	mother wants the little boy to take the umbrella
kansas04a_443.068_1.73.wav_ASR	just wanna take the umbrella
kansas04a_446.585_4.68.wav_ASR	so he goes out and it starts to rain of course as his mother had told him it would
kansas04a_452.243_1.56.wav_ASR	so he goes back
kansas04a_454.24_0.91.wav_ASR	he tells me
kansas04a_455.171_1.15.wav_ASR	and he's very wet
kansas04a_457.426_5.56.wav_ASR	so we goes back in the house and she's very angry with him because he hasn't taken the umbrella
kansas04a_463.777_7.44.wav_ASR	so in the last picture he has the umbrella and it's up and he's walking very happily
kansas04a_506.81_1.84.wav_ASR	well the cat is in the tree
kansas04a_510.155_1.81.wav_ASR	dog is barking at the cat
kansas04a_513.126_4.38.wav_ASR	and the little girl is crying because her cat is in the tree
kansas04a_519.099_8.07.wav_ASR	and her father tried to get it with a ladder and the ladder has fallen down
kansas04a_527.276_4.41.wav_ASR	and the father is still in the tree and he's looking very gloom
kansas04a_532.649_2.56.wav_ASR	and the birds are singing
kansas04a_537.485_4.46.wav_ASR	that's rather queer as everything else is going on
kansas04a_542.482_5.22.wav_ASR	and the firemen have been called and they are going to hafta get the cat down
kansas04a_547.988_3.8.wav_ASR	but i think before they do they hafta get daddy down
kansas04a_576.487_1.57.wav_ASR	there's been a flood
kansas04a_582.466_4.23.wav_ASR	and this lady has been swept away in the flood
kansas04a_590.504_12.69.wav_ASR	and this gentleman in the jacket is coming to rescue her
kansas04a_604.912_6.77.wav_ASR	it's been swept away in the flood so it looks to me
kansas04a_613.723_13.02.wav_ASR	and i do not quite understand this part
kansas04a_634.622_1.22.wav_ASR	yeah i think i am
kansas04a_636.851_1.21.wav_ASR	now what is that
kansas04a_643.48_6.31.wav_ASR	yeah but which one is being rescued in which one isn't
kansas04a_661.844_0.6.wav_ASR	oh yes
kansas04a_668.087_0.84.wav_ASR	knotty
kansas04a_688.588_0.82.wav_ASR	okay
kansas04a_756.402_5.91.wav_ASR	the story's about cinderella and her wicked stepmother and her two halfsisters
kansas04a_762.492_0.68.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
kansas04a_763.997_11.67.wav_ASR	her stepsisters were very unhappy to her and her stepmother was too
kansas04a_776.051_5.38.wav_ASR	and cinderella was left to sweep and clean and do whatever they wanted done
kansas04a_782.592_7.02.wav_ASR	so they got a letter inviting the house to the the ball
kansas04a_791.424_5.37.wav_ASR	the mother said that cinderella could not go
kansas04a_798.1_1.62.wav_ASR	and she was very upset
kansas04a_800.608_12.89.wav_ASR	and so she tried to get her dress together and the two stepsisters tore it apart
kansas04a_815.132_22.74.wav_ASR	and so she went out and told her fairy godmother that they had torn it apart and she wasn't going to go
kansas04a_837.925_6.54.wav_ASR	and and she was crying and and the fairy godmother said yes she could
kansas04a_845.377_4.79.wav_ASR	got her dress and with her wand of course
kansas04a_850.747_14.83.wav_ASR	and so the stepmother and stepchildren started out and she did not go with them
kansas04a_865.963_15.24.wav_ASR	but she went in the carriage that the fairy godmother had knocked out a pumpkin and mice and horse
kansas04a_881.57_0.95.wav_ASR	horse
kansas04a_883.45_2.91.wav_ASR	and she went to the ball
kansas04a_887.004_4.42.wav_ASR	and the prince greeted her at the ball
kansas04a_892.03_1.55.wav_ASR	and they dance
kansas04a_893.647_1.85.wav_ASR	and then it was twelve o'clock
kansas04a_895.645_2.1.wav_ASR	she hadta be home by twelve o'clock
kansas04a_897.799_2.56.wav_ASR	so she ran out and lost her slipper
kansas04a_901.571_7.85.wav_ASR	and she went and got the carriage and of course the carriage all closed
kansas04a_909.825_1.47.wav_ASR	and she went home
kansas04a_912.607_9.82.wav_ASR	and then the following week or so time of year
kansas04a_922.783_10.71.wav_ASR	the footmen were set out with the slipper to find which girl in the kingdom had fit
kansas04a_934.46_7.29.wav_ASR	and she was locked in her room so she could not get to the come down
kansas04a_942.65_2.64.wav_ASR	and she was very upset
kansas04a_946.239_4.44.wav_ASR	and the slipper
kansas04a_952.096_3.38.wav_ASR	and away the the mice slipper out
kansas04a_957.72_3.9.wav_ASR	and she came down and and of course she fit the slipper
kansas04a_962.075_1.87.wav_ASR	but the other did not

kansas04a_990.452_4.73.wav_ASR	and get get some of the peanut butter and spread it on one piece of bread
kansas04a_995.9_4.73.wav_ASR	and spread the jelly on the same piece of bread
kansas04a_1001.062_1.38.wav_ASR	and then put the top on it

kansas05a_363.8_0.7.wav_ASR	you know or
kansas05a_364.761_2.21.wav_ASR	they didn't mean that but
kansas05a_374.375_2.99.wav_ASR	because i wanna have us to do better
kansas05a_379.021_4.21.wav_ASR	it it's much more difficult
kansas05a_384.531_4.34.wav_ASR	you know when i look around and i see a lot of people who know
kansas05a_389.118_1.34.wav_ASR	you know they're all around here
kansas05a_390.473_0.99.wav_ASR	you don't talk to people
kansas05a_391.485_2.95.wav_ASR	people had different opinions
kansas05a_394.676_3.96.wav_ASR	you know i have no problems with my eating my legs and you know and all that
kansas05a_398.681_2.2.wav_ASR	one i don't have any problems particular
kansas05a_401.308_2.97.wav_ASR	useta be time as time gone on i hadta get better
kansas05a_405.255_6.03.wav_ASR	but now where was i going
kansas05a_411.561_1.63.wav_ASR	what were we asking me again
kansas05a_420.085_1.64.wav_ASR	oh yes what i was talking about right
kansas05a_422.593_9.96.wav_ASR	we're i'm working along with working towards having more time more more
kansas05a_434.918_3.07.wav_ASR	as time goes on i learned more and more what to do
kansas05a_439.556_1.65.wav_ASR	and so that's what i'm doing
kansas05a_467.065_0.97.wav_ASR	so they come different
kansas05a_468.95_4.67.wav_ASR	so tell me the story with a beginning a middle and an end
kansas05a_473.861_0.95.wav_ASR	of each one
kansas05a_480.821_2.29.wav_ASR	so each one of these i suppose to do something with it
kansas05a_483.43_0.79.wav_ASR	that's that you're saying
kansas05a_497.343_0.77.wav_ASR	oh
kansas05a_504.475_17.939.wav_ASR	well the first one is learning through this this this mess
kansas05a_529.355_7.84.wav_ASR	it's a plan a plan a problem
kansas05a_540.213_11.2.wav_ASR	that well with a that's a a list a plan or or here and there
kansas05a_554.453_7.16.wav_ASR	there's a friend easy working with that perfect this one
kansas05a_563.678_3.27.wav_ASR	because these people are making a problem
kansas05a_580.09_0.63.wav_ASR	what is that
kansas05a_589.826_1.82.wav_ASR	oh that's kinda dumb stuff
kansas05a_593.266_2.41.wav_ASR	and i think that takes a little work to make that look right
kansas05a_596.395_2.36.wav_ASR	okay i'm sposta
kansas05a_600.809_1.48.wav_ASR	when i was sposta do with this one
kansas05a_603.491_0.94.wav_ASR	what's it afraid of
kansas05a_605.0_1.13.wav_ASR	did the window break
kansas05a_608.523_1.45.wav_ASR	okay well that's it then
kansas05a_643.723_19.47.wav_ASR	so the the first person is a problem there
kansas05a_666.113_5.28.wav_ASR	he's he's trying to get the cat
kansas05a_674.141_4.53.wav_ASR	looking at the tears and again
kansas05a_681.195_14.69.wav_ASR	and and believing that the second people should
kansas05a_702.031_0.71.wav_ASR	three i think so
kansas05a_703.736_3.14.wav_ASR	he he's not sposta do that for him
kansas05a_708.008_3.8.wav_ASR	three this one guy wants the these pieces to come down you know
kansas05a_712.325_1.15.wav_ASR	or he wants it by himself
kansas05a_715.293_1.03.wav_ASR	it's not quite quite right but
kansas05a_718.205_0.34.wav_ASR	what
kansas05a_719.0_0.38.wav_ASR	which one
kansas05a_721.863_10.62.wav_ASR	there he's looking out four on the the the the the trees on how to deal with those things
kansas05a_732.528_5.87.wav_ASR	the the old stuff that that's been afraid there
kansas05a_740.616_16.13.wav_ASR	there the the mother is not not happy with her her person of what went all the the little problems that they look here together
kansas05a_759.633_4.72.wav_ASR	well he then he was back there again
kansas05a_764.921_0.88.wav_ASR	ex oh i see
kansas05a_766.03_12.56.wav_ASR	his mother wanted him to go back to the good stuff he was done before so that he can go back on to this this kind of stuff again that makes him look better
kansas05a_779.24_4.95.wav_ASR	and he goes back and the ideas that he's got make them go back and look look better
kansas05a_812.463_2.81.wav_ASR	well i guess she started with that
kansas05a_819.976_6.9.wav_ASR	people sitting with their they're they're mess their stuff around
kansas05a_827.928_1.1.wav_ASR	one two his
kansas05a_831.043_4.35.wav_ASR	the the kind of a umbrella people there

kurland05a_768.713_6.43.wav_ASR	well this comes to i write on the roof because i play soccer for free
kurland05a_775.731_4.04.wav_ASR	and the first picture shows a young guy playing soccer
kurland05a_780.772_0.81.wav_ASR	he kicks the ball
kurland05a_781.6_6.34.wav_ASR	and he must be too close to the house because he put the ball right through the window
kurland05a_789.212_6.9.wav_ASR	and as luck would have it the home owner was sitting right by the window to smash
kurland05a_796.131_4.91.wav_ASR	and he knocked the lamp over and smashed it
kurland05a_801.46_2.26.wav_ASR	so it comes a little damage you know
kurland05a_804.612_7.97.wav_ASR	and the last picture shows the home owner holding the soccer ball and looking out the window
kurland05a_812.6_5.26.wav_ASR	so i only manage what happened on the picture if there was one
kurland05a_855.661_3.73.wav_ASR	well i guess it shows a woman and probably her son
kurland05a_860.063_1.44.wav_ASR	and he wants to go outside and says
kurland05a_862.307_0.51.wav_ASR	but she's
kurland05a_862.998_2.06.wav_ASR	take your umbrella you know where you go
kurland05a_865.108_1.27.wav_ASR	he's he wanted to take it
kurland05a_867.751_2.56.wav_ASR	and she offered him twice i guess
kurland05a_870.393_1.62.wav_ASR	and he's still there
kurland05a_872.035_0.74.wav_ASR	and he was outside
kurland05a_872.828_3.42.wav_ASR	the third picture shows a get drench
kurland05a_876.326_4.09.wav_ASR	and the fourth picture shows it's getting drenched even worse you know
kurland05a_882.162_1.98.wav_ASR	so he goes back inside soaked wet
kurland05a_884.93_0.85.wav_ASR	mother says
kurland05a_885.939_0.89.wav_ASR	try i told you so
kurland05a_886.879_5.12.wav_ASR	and the last picture shows him with a umbrella like she should have had the first place
kurland05a_903.958_0.5.wav_ASR	alright
kurland05a_916.499_3.08.wav_ASR	well eventually the cat climb the tree
kurland05a_919.6_3.77.wav_ASR	and as cat or person they couldn't get down the tree
kurland05a_925.566_9.21.wav_ASR	and a home owner somebody you know a mile try to get up the tree and he could get the the cat down either
kurland05a_936.567_1.42.wav_ASR	the girl's crying for her cat
kurland05a_939.74_3.82.wav_ASR	oh the reason the guy's getting get down because the ladder fell down
kurland05a_944.348_0.99.wav_ASR	so he's stuck in the tree

kurland05b_138.764_4.16.wav_ASR	and i i know something's wrong but that's homework just temporary
kurland05b_144.024_7.14.wav_ASR	so not until on my wife had didn't say anything to my wife the rest of the sunday

kurland05b_744.592_1.132.wav_ASR	yeah i remember this one yeah
kurland05b_755.253_4.52.wav_ASR	well the little girl's probably hurt her tricycle
kurland05b_759.794_2.18.wav_ASR	and they wake up
kurland05b_761.996_4.72.wav_ASR	and the dog chase the cat up a tree
kurland05b_768.041_7.81.wav_ASR	and then her father or some older gentleman tries to get the cat down from the tree
kurland05b_776.416_4.18.wav_ASR	and anyway the ladder falls down from the tree so he's stuck too
kurland05b_781.781_5.59.wav_ASR	then the fire department's come in with the second ladder to get the the guy down and the cat down

kurland05b_815.154_0.57.wav_ASR	that's okay
kurland05b_909.402_3.36.wav_ASR	once upon a time there was a girl named cinderella
kurland05b_913.675_7.88.wav_ASR	he had two sisters not very lucky in the evil stepmother i guess
kurland05b_922.524_6.82.wav_ASR	and there's a ball or something you know a prom or a ball or whatever
kurland05b_930.118_7.16.wav_ASR	and the mother and the two girls went to the ball
kurland05b_938.355_5.11.wav_ASR	and they told cinderella to stay home with you know watch the floors because they're all dirty
kurland05b_945.465_0.99.wav_ASR	so cinderella stayed home
kurland05b_946.474_3.95.wav_ASR	and some how she found the the chest or whatever
kurland05b_950.444_4.35.wav_ASR	her something something magical happens
kurland05b_955.569_3.66.wav_ASR	and he ways she got to the ball
kurland05b_960.256_15.48.wav_ASR	and and you know and going to the ball she took a carriage that was made out of a pumpkin and that was transformed somehow by some fairy whatever
kurland05b_976.988_3.15.wav_ASR	hey aphasia i don't
kurland05b_981.967_7.69.wav_ASR	he's the the the carriage returns to back to a pumpkin in the middle of the night
kurland05b_991.035_2.82.wav_ASR	so cinderella have me me make my time you know
kurland05b_994.22_9.66.wav_ASR	well she took off from the ball before midnight so she wouldn't turn into a pumpkin again
kurland05b_1004.309_1.67.wav_ASR	and she lost the slipper
kurland05b_1006.874_2.58.wav_ASR	and while she was there she was dancing with the prince
kurland05b_1009.716_4.87.wav_ASR	and they always the prince you know got all the slipper
kurland05b_1014.608_2.97.wav_ASR	and he likes her a lot
kurland05b_1017.86_5.95.wav_ASR	he he had a shoe fitting
kurland05b_1024.992_3.069.wav_ASR	where where fit in the shoe would be cinderella
kurland05b_1028.833_4.409.wav_ASR	and they way cinderella fit into the slipper
kurland05b_1035.181_0.6.wav_ASR	they get married
kurland05b_1035.799_1.43.wav_ASR	and they lived happily ever after
kurland05b_1048.697_0.45.wav_ASR	alright
kurland05b_1055.422_0.45.wav_ASR	okay
kurland05b_1056.34_1.33.wav_ASR	take two pieces of bread
kurland05b_1059.379_1.51.wav_ASR	and you lay them on top of the table
kurland05b_1061.055_8.55.wav_ASR	and he put skippy peanut butter the small version because the the the crunchy stuff that's not sprouts so well
kurland05b_1070.403_1.97.wav_ASR	they put it down the bread
kurland05b_1073.065_1.85.wav_ASR	but that's one half
kurland05b_1074.939_11.48.wav_ASR	and then other half on the other half i use raspberry because those make the best for peanut butter and jelly sandwiches
kurland05b_1086.976_1.86.wav_ASR	leave it on the other piece
kurland05b_1088.915_1.73.wav_ASR	and i just slap them together
kurland05b_1091.815_1.39.wav_ASR	and i cut in half

71-1_160.22_5.0.wav_ASR	so i i could tell you other stories but they wouldn't probably be the same
71-1_165.44_2.1.wav_ASR	so we wanna go into all the details
71-1_174.46_3.52.wav_ASR	it was ireland because i met my father
71-1_178.1_6.44.wav_ASR	my father's family was only two generations from immigrating to the united states

71-1_191.32_5.02.wav_ASR	and so i actually meet with other couples second cousins
71-1_196.572_2.608.wav_ASR	that's what the exact relationship is
71-1_199.432_1.95.wav_ASR	but i met people that were part of my family
71-1_201.692_7.006.wav_ASR	and i universities or second or third cousins that looked exactly like my father and my uncle
71-1_209.352_4.804.wav_ASR	oh yeah yeah that was the little bit extra on spending i think yeah
71-1_236.89_0.84.wav_ASR	it comes and goes
71-1_238.25_4.65.wav_ASR	oh i would say that the main problem with my language is that it's unreliable
71-1_243.73_5.13.wav_ASR	as i said a few minutes ago i was talking about going
71-1_249.84_4.21.wav_ASR	and what's interesting is that it's the values that i have issues with
71-1_254.46_2.14.wav_ASR	oh i could not say umbrella
71-1_257.12_1.089.wav_ASR	and i think i said a word
71-1_258.58_0.629.wav_ASR	then i said
71-1_259.68_6.89.wav_ASR	but i was really thinking in my brain how to walk around that or figure that out or feel that out
71-1_267.01_2.96.wav_ASR	and i complain a lot
71-1_270.27_1.84.wav_ASR	and i didn't appreciate that happening
71-1_272.61_2.16.wav_ASR	better than i was
71-1_275.11_5.22.wav_ASR	well i still have difficulty with complicated conjugations
71-1_281.15_1.54.wav_ASR	well i still
71-1_282.906_4.581.wav_ASR	well not that i have been confusing to other people
71-1_287.466_3.295.wav_ASR	and i do remember back what it was like when i was teaching before the stroke
71-1_291.106_1.62.wav_ASR	and people would look puzzle
71-1_293.566_0.577.wav_ASR	and it was like
71-1_294.446_0.82.wav_ASR	oh they're problem
71-1_295.586_5.857.wav_ASR	one they look puzzle a lot of times i'm pretty sure it's because i said something that didn't make any sense
71-1_301.443_11.647.wav_ASR	so i'm still trying to work on explaining complicated things to people and trying to correct myself when i make mistakes mistakes
71-1_313.523_6.04.wav_ASR	and i do continue speech on a regular basis
71-1_319.736_1.86.wav_ASR	so it's frustrating
71-1_321.916_8.864.wav_ASR	but i keep practicing it to the point that many people don't think i have aphasia until they do notice that i have aphasia
71-1_331.276_5.44.wav_ASR	so i can communicate but not well and not the way that i useta be able to communicate
71-1_347.09_0.959.wav_ASR	oh very much
71-1_348.131_1.199.wav_ASR	yeah yeah about it
71-1_350.191_0.82.wav_ASR	oh yeah
71-1_357.66_4.863.wav_ASR	well i didn't know that it was a stroke is very typical
71-1_363.04_1.71.wav_ASR	but then i had one before
71-1_364.78_1.964.wav_ASR	so how did i know what a stroke was
71-1_366.88_4.114.wav_ASR	so i was elegant working out
71-1_371.1_1.984.wav_ASR	it was january first
71-1_373.42_4.0.wav_ASR	that was the day when i you know that's the day when the resurrection stopped
71-1_377.8_1.688.wav_ASR	so i hafta get out there
71-1_379.52_2.533.wav_ASR	and i needta start working out again harder than i did
71-1_382.16_0.893.wav_ASR	and i was at his job
71-1_384.16_2.555.wav_ASR	and i worked the hell out man
71-1_386.84_1.385.wav_ASR	you know i think i did eat too much
71-1_388.82_3.88.wav_ASR	my right was up to like a hundred seven
71-1_393.18_0.64.wav_ASR	oh okay
71-1_394.24_0.819.wav_ASR	and you keep this on
71-1_395.34_2.9.wav_ASR	yeah i and i wasn't tired
71-1_398.62_0.92.wav_ASR	it wasn't fit
71-1_400.16_11.482.wav_ASR	and i got off the elevator and had double visit i would walk for two more miles mostly because the black panther was on
71-1_412.0_1.26.wav_ASR	happy
71-1_413.3_0.677.wav_ASR	but that was on
71-1_413.977_4.84.wav_ASR	and i thought i wanted to watch it because really like chat with you
71-1_419.837_1.766.wav_ASR	oh well it's washing up
71-1_422.137_2.144.wav_ASR	and again i had double vision
71-1_425.157_2.023.wav_ASR	oh i just didn't feel good anymore
71-1_427.66_7.131.wav_ASR	went home and had a thunder clap header on my right side
71-1_434.94_0.52.wav_ASR	and i just said
71-1_435.94_1.381.wav_ASR	oh no idea what that is
71-1_437.76_2.145.wav_ASR	so i course enrolled in at the sl
71-1_440.66_2.93.wav_ASR	the next day i couldn't work it on
71-1_443.78_1.7.wav_ASR	it's trying to write a conference proposal
71-1_445.86_0.64.wav_ASR	nothing would work
71-1_446.77_1.3.wav_ASR	and i couldn't do
71-1_449.31_3.735.wav_ASR	so i went to get my head my hair cut the next day
71-1_453.11_3.247.wav_ASR	and i wanted to canvas because i had really bad headache
71-1_456.67_2.13.wav_ASR	but if you call it you hadta pay for it
71-1_459.29_1.889.wav_ASR	and my hair be be cut
71-1_461.93_0.942.wav_ASR	oh i
71-1_462.93_1.662.wav_ASR	and i live alone
71-1_464.592_2.463.wav_ASR	so i hadn't really talked to anybody in two days
71-1_467.512_1.658.wav_ASR	down in the tree
71-1_469.572_2.734.wav_ASR	and i couldn't tell her how i wanted to get my hair cut
71-1_473.192_2.18.wav_ASR	and i couldn't say
71-1_476.352_4.42.wav_ASR	so i couldn't tell her that i'd been wearing slippers
71-1_481.512_1.76.wav_ASR	oh i don't know what was coming
71-1_483.692_0.608.wav_ASR	and i was tall
71-1_484.66_2.06.wav_ASR	and she's like nodding it's smiling
71-1_486.78_1.691.wav_ASR	but he had no idea what i was talking
71-1_489.8_0.46.wav_ASR	oh i see
71-1_490.62_1.01.wav_ASR	oh something's wrong
71-1_492.54_1.8.wav_ASR	so i told her
71-1_494.62_0.3.wav_ASR	and i said
71-1_495.129_0.678.wav_ASR	like your hair
71-1_497.02_2.56.wav_ASR	so she luckily she didn't have the biggest hair
71-1_499.94_1.89.wav_ASR	but she cut her hair the way i did
71-1_502.08_0.3.wav_ASR	and i said
71-1_502.46_3.93.wav_ASR	you know i better go call a doctor because this doesn't make any sense
71-1_507.5_2.1.wav_ASR	so i i i try
71-1_510.16_4.24.wav_ASR	and i think this is something that must happen with people that has strokes is that they
71-1_516.46_3.62.wav_ASR	look up the number that i was sposta call emergency
71-1_520.22_1.589.wav_ASR	and this was already six o'clock
71-1_522.35_2.64.wav_ASR	and it had all of these things
71-1_526.21_3.46.wav_ASR	if it's an immediate emergency go call nine one one
71-1_530.13_0.33.wav_ASR	and i thought
71-1_530.61_0.757.wav_ASR	thank you
71-1_531.59_3.737.wav_ASR	just to make an appointment and go into the emergency clinic around the corner
71-1_536.11_0.706.wav_ASR	and then it says
71-1_537.11_3.2.wav_ASR	if it's this situation call
71-1_540.703_4.014.wav_ASR	and if it's this situation call you know press three
71-1_545.023_2.16.wav_ASR	if it's this situation call
71-1_548.083_3.82.wav_ASR	apparently if you stayed on for two and a half minutes they finally say
71-1_552.343_1.811.wav_ASR	real person will come on the wire
71-1_555.283_1.601.wav_ASR	but my head really hurt
71-1_557.243_0.593.wav_ASR	oh i'm just going
71-1_557.903_1.16.wav_ASR	well this isn't well
71-1_559.46_2.24.wav_ASR	so i hung up the phone and said
71-1_561.9_1.13.wav_ASR	oh just get up to the top of the tree
71-1_563.38_2.36.wav_ASR	and i'll see if i anybody will answer the phone
71-1_566.68_1.06.wav_ASR	but i told my son
71-1_568.34_4.12.wav_ASR	and she she was very frightened
71-1_573.0_0.6.wav_ASR	you just sit
71-1_573.7_1.12.wav_ASR	don't sun yourself
71-1_576.13_1.22.wav_ASR	you needta go take an ambulance
71-1_577.9_1.29.wav_ASR	you're gonna pay for it
71-1_579.24_0.78.wav_ASR	it's repetitive
71-1_580.52_1.22.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
71-1_581.84_0.82.wav_ASR	and just have a headache
71-1_582.9_2.28.wav_ASR	and i don't wanna spend that much money
71-1_586.02_6.16.wav_ASR	and she and her partner they called the fire department
71-1_592.48_0.8.wav_ASR	he's in minnesota
71-1_593.56_2.263.wav_ASR	he's just finishing school up there
71-1_596.04_2.585.wav_ASR	but she they called the fire department in madison
71-1_598.625_1.419.wav_ASR	and and they said
71-1_601.165_2.74.wav_ASR	affection this is
71-1_604.725_1.16.wav_ASR	three this is her slipper
71-1_606.385_0.335.wav_ASR	and they said
71-1_607.54_1.23.wav_ASR	it's like she's having a stroke
71-1_609.285_2.315.wav_ASR	and she needs to get to the emergency
71-1_613.76_1.04.wav_ASR	and and they said
71-1_614.845_1.205.wav_ASR	but she doesn't wanna go
71-1_616.36_0.52.wav_ASR	and they said
71-1_616.96_5.542.wav_ASR	all of a sudden i know is i'm living on my you know getting ready to sleep
71-1_623.14_4.643.wav_ASR	and i hear the people running up the stairs outside my apartment
71-1_628.28_4.927.wav_ASR	then just over these really good looking firemen by the way
71-1_633.62_2.12.wav_ASR	but i i think it must be the universe
71-1_636.04_0.645.wav_ASR	massage
71-1_637.365_1.928.wav_ASR	and i answered the door
71-1_639.285_1.265.wav_ASR	and i told them that
71-1_640.825_1.38.wav_ASR	oh i didn't have
71-1_642.545_1.252.wav_ASR	they didn't know what was going on
71-1_644.165_1.173.wav_ASR	but i couldn't talk
71-1_646.805_1.205.wav_ASR	you needta come with us right now
71-1_648.285_0.355.wav_ASR	and i said
71-1_648.745_0.913.wav_ASR	well no i'll take it
71-1_650.705_0.335.wav_ASR	and they said
71-1_651.417_0.908.wav_ASR	you can't drive
71-1_653.105_1.585.wav_ASR	oh i'm gonna go to the
71-1_654.885_1.437.wav_ASR	oh you're gonna go this right now
71-1_656.32_0.62.wav_ASR	oh my sister
71-1_657.32_0.817.wav_ASR	oh alright
71-1_658.28_2.28.wav_ASR	well let me get my coat and all the other stuff
71-1_660.88_3.715.wav_ASR	yeah all of a sudden i got into the emergency room
71-1_664.74_1.961.wav_ASR	it was just this huge
71-1_667.8_1.86.wav_ASR	it's racing around and jelly
71-1_670.22_6.1.wav_ASR	and all of a sudden they held me in for a cat scan and came out and said
71-1_676.5_1.02.wav_ASR	yeah you had a stroke
71-1_678.32_2.727.wav_ASR	so i ask the doctor if i can come in
71-1_681.06_3.681.wav_ASR	and he showed me on the cat scan exactly what it had happened
71-1_685.44_3.23.wav_ASR	and they hated it
71-1_689.38_2.962.wav_ASR	so that's the way i found out i had a stroke
71-1_692.75_6.56.wav_ASR	yeah i i really have had no issues what so ever with mice mice feet feet
71-1_699.81_1.65.wav_ASR	my hands i'm no
71-1_702.78_2.04.wav_ASR	and i just didn't know about the headache
71-1_705.03_0.95.wav_ASR	never had one again
71-1_706.88_1.18.wav_ASR	never had my phone
71-1_708.53_7.93.wav_ASR	but apparently if you get a really really bad headache that hits you on the side of the head it means you should probably go to the emergency room
71-1_717.45_2.54.wav_ASR	oh i don't know if that gave you
71-1_720.582_1.363.wav_ASR	it doesn't give you a lot of insight
71-1_722.34_8.435.wav_ASR	again if i worked out when i had the headache it was probably right after i worked out when i had the headache because some of that they could have stopped it
71-1_731.3_3.77.wav_ASR	point the window of opportunity hadta
71-1_737.18_5.617.wav_ASR	but it wasn't a symptom stroke not a hemorrhagic stroke
71-1_743.84_6.846.wav_ASR	and they ultimately decided it was precipitous because they've not been able to find out why i had it
71-1_751.22_7.24.wav_ASR	all of my numbers are medical numbers are good
71-1_758.94_0.8.wav_ASR	and not die back
71-1_760.32_0.82.wav_ASR	oh i don't smoke
71-1_762.02_1.88.wav_ASR	and i have little blood pressure
71-1_764.42_2.25.wav_ASR	everything looks
71-1_767.76_1.39.wav_ASR	but i did enjoy have a stroke
71-1_769.54_2.64.wav_ASR	so something happened somewhere
71-1_772.78_3.16.wav_ASR	and in the hospital i got to watch the internet
71-1_776.46_0.954.wav_ASR	and it's just
71-1_780.18_0.96.wav_ASR	yeah right
71-1_781.58_4.48.wav_ASR	yeah so yeah so two years later here
71-1_797.2_17.56.wav_ASR	well again and if i ever get to the point that i'm articulate enough about this i'm going to use my public service and and research and do something more about getting people some kind of treatment
71-1_814.772_2.553.wav_ASR	and i was given almost nothing
71-1_817.552_3.086.wav_ASR	partly i think it was because
71-1_820.772_2.485.wav_ASR	and it really massive was a major city
71-1_823.472_6.42.wav_ASR	so i should have been able to get the best type of help
71-1_830.372_0.477.wav_ASR	and i did
71-1_830.849_4.78.wav_ASR	and the best i could get was we found two speech therapists
71-1_836.569_2.232.wav_ASR	one of them only specialized in children
71-1_839.189_1.351.wav_ASR	so i didn't work with
71-1_840.909_0.92.wav_ASR	the other person
71-1_842.229_4.18.wav_ASR	and it's a little one hour a week
71-1_847.59_16.523.wav_ASR	and basically because i am an accident because i hadta do my own research
71-1_864.29_2.08.wav_ASR	hadta do a lot of things
71-1_866.55_4.28.wav_ASR	and the the speech profession it was not professional therapist
71-1_871.09_0.612.wav_ASR	they're different
71-1_872.39_3.118.wav_ASR	but she i mean she helped me a lot i would say
71-1_875.61_2.902.wav_ASR	so i should be looking up on this particular thing
71-1_878.63_2.25.wav_ASR	and i should be looking out the picture top
71-1_881.53_3.02.wav_ASR	and but she hasn't kept up with it either
71-1_884.71_4.16.wav_ASR	and she hadn't learned about some of the most recent treatments that were available
71-1_889.53_7.52.wav_ASR	so basically what i did is i i went back to exercise as soon as they allowed me
71-1_897.35_2.7.wav_ASR	three i couldn't work out for three months
71-1_900.34_5.67.wav_ASR	and i could only walk because they were concerned that my physical ability had something to do with the stroke
71-1_906.42_0.66.wav_ASR	yeah
71-1_909.64_1.189.wav_ASR	oh i just hadta walk
71-1_911.14_1.081.wav_ASR	and i had
71-1_913.2_1.401.wav_ASR	they tested me for abcd
71-1_914.74_3.28.wav_ASR	and i hadta wear this work multiple on for about three months
71-1_918.17_2.86.wav_ASR	but i don't have aphasia either so
71-1_921.33_2.315.wav_ASR	but i focus on drive
71-1_924.37_4.82.wav_ASR	really wasn't drinking much alcohol at all then
71-1_930.27_1.38.wav_ASR	but i stopped to comply
71-1_932.87_2.66.wav_ASR	so now i back exercise as much as i can
71-1_935.83_2.18.wav_ASR	and really care in terms of my die
71-1_938.49_7.52.wav_ASR	and i really focus on implementation limiting it in terms of my diet and what i
71-1_947.57_2.29.wav_ASR	and i write every day
71-1_950.51_1.38.wav_ASR	oh i journal every day
71-1_951.89_3.934.wav_ASR	right now i'm trying to write a article which i hope to get published
71-1_955.824_20.3.wav_ASR	that's maybe the hardest thing from my brain that i ever hadta do before the stroke or after is the ability to weave arguments together in he really dance well written type of of organization
71-1_976.405_1.819.wav_ASR	so some part of the word
71-1_978.345_9.56.wav_ASR	three i read aloud every day the news papers because i think sentences words is a way of writing those
71-1_988.605_2.865.wav_ASR	whether it's the fires that were there
71-1_991.665_2.454.wav_ASR	two i just needta learn learn how to say a word
71-1_994.405_0.82.wav_ASR	umbrella umbrella
71-1_995.479_4.388.wav_ASR	and i'll probably be able to say that a lot for a long time until the weeks
71-1_999.919_4.279.wav_ASR	and then i'll miss miss pronounce that one again
71-1_1005.119_5.531.wav_ASR	but that's really all i know how to do is keep it up until it turns
71-1_1011.439_0.611.wav_ASR	and sleeping
71-1_1012.379_2.191.wav_ASR	oh i'm always sleeping
71-1_1014.87_2.86.wav_ASR	generally have gone without it
71-1_1018.68_1.81.wav_ASR	you know if you stay above level you're doing something
71-1_1020.89_3.12.wav_ASR	you still hafta get up because you have a class or you got stuff to do
71-1_1024.67_8.638.wav_ASR	and i try to make sure i always have at least eight or nine hours a day to be able to sleep
71-1_1033.308_3.68.wav_ASR	and that seems to be something that i didn't needta do before
71-1_1037.181_1.688.wav_ASR	now i really do needta do
71-1_1038.968_2.762.wav_ASR	but that's time i'm doing
71-1_1042.028_0.872.wav_ASR	still working
71-1_1043.248_1.404.wav_ASR	but i'm not able to teach
71-1_1045.089_3.024.wav_ASR	you can see what i would be like in ninety minutes
71-1_1048.268_0.89.wav_ASR	they get in front of a ladder
71-1_1049.328_0.769.wav_ASR	they're talking
71-1_1050.288_0.602.wav_ASR	people will be gone
71-1_1051.388_0.52.wav_ASR	oh
71-1_1052.271_0.5.wav_ASR	yeah
71-1_1054.451_1.998.wav_ASR	so maybe they're coming
71-1_1056.791_0.58.wav_ASR	and i can do
71-1_1058.051_3.74.wav_ASR	and i could teach through online and stuff
71-1_1062.471_2.149.wav_ASR	but so far i'm just doing other stuff
71-1_1064.971_1.119.wav_ASR	but i did love teaching
71-1_1067.49_1.36.wav_ASR	well see if i get back to it again
71-1_1069.371_0.419.wav_ASR	yeah i don't know
71-1_1070.87_1.35.wav_ASR	and anyway so that's what i do
71-1_1072.81_4.64.wav_ASR	and and i think doing it consistently is really really important
71-1_1077.79_2.66.wav_ASR	and i just keep pushing myself to do different things
71-1_1081.13_6.08.wav_ASR	there's little nothing that i'm not forcing myself to
71-1_1087.51_0.909.wav_ASR	four not forcing myself
71-1_1088.69_2.265.wav_ASR	the certain things i go through every single day
71-1_1091.81_2.36.wav_ASR	and i do yoga every night
71-1_1094.51_1.1.wav_ASR	and i think that's useful
71-1_1096.57_1.69.wav_ASR	but i i don't know
71-1_1098.26_19.94.wav_ASR	oh again i'm always looking at research always trying to find something that's going to create my healing in some way or another to the extent that my brain will be able to repair those language and way into the extent that it was is what was disrupted
71-1_1119.04_7.42.wav_ASR	spend a fair amount of time trying to figure out why right handed person with the stroke on the right side ended up with aphasia
71-1_1127.38_10.66.wav_ASR	but i mean other than the fact that it doesn't quallify me for many clinical trials because they do clinical trials
71-1_1138.248_3.801.wav_ASR	other than that i guess i just don't worry about it all that much
71-1_1142.228_13.0.wav_ASR	and i'm just doing what i can to try to heal and recover on neuroplasticity to be able to take take hold
71-1_1155.48_9.755.wav_ASR	so i do understand that at my age in my sixties personality is less like like as much as healing is
71-1_1165.72_1.66.wav_ASR	so i don't know
71-1_1167.66_0.67.wav_ASR	we'll see what
71-1_1168.91_6.48.wav_ASR	just watch it every day this experiment in work or this work in progress and see
71-1_1175.93_2.077.wav_ASR	how it comes out and how it doesn't come out
71-1_1178.67_1.08.wav_ASR	well see yeah
71-1_1179.91_1.98.wav_ASR	oh a lot of people don't know i have aphasia
71-1_1182.17_12.68.wav_ASR	and i like keeping it that way because the there's a stigma attached to having a disability even if it's invisible
71-1_1196.42_8.392.wav_ASR	other people just think i misspoke then them think that they hafta speak very carefully around to me
71-1_1205.08_4.784.wav_ASR	oh i i rather just see if i can just wing it
71-1_1210.7_3.66.wav_ASR	oh yeah very few people know that i have aphasia
71-1_1214.592_1.416.wav_ASR	they family members know
71-1_1216.008_3.437.wav_ASR	but i don't tell anyone else about it
71-1_1219.768_1.825.wav_ASR	just try to figure it out
71-1_1242.33_1.36.wav_ASR	and it should be something important
71-1_1246.83_4.6.wav_ASR	well you know i i guess i would
71-1_1251.764_12.94.wav_ASR	something that i would say is being very important for me was working with firstnamem elder who
71-1_1266.024_2.112.wav_ASR	very close to work
71-1_1268.136_3.957.wav_ASR	 i met aadri about ten years ago
71-1_1273.036_2.404.wav_ASR	pretty more fifteen years at this point
71-1_1276.336_2.78.wav_ASR	and i was teaching at a university
71-1_1279.476_1.38.wav_ASR	and i invited her to
71-1_1280.996_6.4.wav_ASR	and i was the visitor of the native students organization because my research is on state tribal relations
71-1_1287.93_7.06.wav_ASR	and i had invited her to come and speak in one of my classes
71-1_1295.79_0.926.wav_ASR	and she came down
71-1_1297.17_2.48.wav_ASR	and we hit it off with each other
71-1_1300.24_3.96.wav_ASR	and she was one of the most romantic people that i've ever met
71-1_1304.73_5.19.wav_ASR	she was the oldest in a family of eleven
71-1_1310.55_3.42.wav_ASR	he grew up on the many many reservations with out running water
71-1_1315.01_5.11.wav_ASR	he was the first person to get a college degree from her high school
71-1_1321.04_3.68.wav_ASR	and she became the first female principal chair
71-1_1325.92_7.08.wav_ASR	and in the last ten years i would say we've gone on trips together
71-1_1333.92_3.12.wav_ASR	and i generally because as she's getting older she's under eighty
71-1_1337.32_0.87.wav_ASR	so she lets me drive
71-1_1339.05_7.74.wav_ASR	and you go to different events or different hearing in which she's going to offer tests
71-1_1347.67_7.05.wav_ASR	and what i learned from hanging out with this woman who's the word i would use
71-1_1355.21_1.06.wav_ASR	yeah oh
71-1_1356.984_2.503.wav_ASR	he doesn't see that well anymore
71-1_1359.704_1.4.wav_ASR	he's trouble reading any more
71-1_1361.57_3.02.wav_ASR	but she has me write speeches for her
71-1_1365.124_1.586.wav_ASR	he gets up and presents them
71-1_1366.71_12.02.wav_ASR	and and she refuses to to listen to the the response no
71-1_1379.45_3.74.wav_ASR	and she will find away to pour on through
71-1_1384.07_3.535.wav_ASR	and she gets things done that other people have not done
71-1_1387.89_9.96.wav_ASR	and why i see this is important is my own mother is very positive and very kind of nice and believes that you deserve to men
71-1_1398.43_12.315.wav_ASR	and hanging out with firstnamel i have learned a great deal about what it means to be a poor woman not to worry about people's problems when you say something
71-1_1411.09_1.635.wav_ASR	and just get up
71-1_1412.95_0.663.wav_ASR	you say your tree
71-1_1414.29_1.84.wav_ASR	and present your test results
71-1_1416.263_8.47.wav_ASR	and push every lever that you can easily to be able to get things through
71-1_1424.733_14.14.wav_ASR	so working with firstnamea over the last couple of years we've been able to stop a mind from place which would have been really difficult
71-1_1440.7_6.776.wav_ASR	so she has been my insurance until of what i learned from her
71-1_1447.78_1.68.wav_ASR	yeah oh that's a really fun
71-1_1449.92_2.26.wav_ASR	so there's that's the other thing
71-1_1452.86_0.96.wav_ASR	oh yeah
71-1_1454.02_6.652.wav_ASR	he's been an on going course of important events for me to accomplish myself after
71-1_1514.123_7.78.wav_ASR	well i mean it looks like beginnings with a boy who's playing with a soccer ball
71-1_1522.3_7.984.wav_ASR	he's probably in his yard because this is something that he's really interested in doing
71-1_1530.81_8.77.wav_ASR	and he kicked the ball maybe a little bit too powerfully than he wanted
71-1_1540.7_3.8.wav_ASR	and it broke into the window next door
71-1_1545.58_2.64.wav_ASR	and unfortunately he broke the window
71-1_1549.0_11.31.wav_ASR	and the ball came through the window right next to the chair where his next door neighbor a man is sitting on his chair
71-1_1561.7_4.32.wav_ASR	oh he's obviously really upset about this because he could have been hurt
71-1_1566.34_1.16.wav_ASR	and the glass breaks
71-1_1568.22_1.04.wav_ASR	and it's in his
71-1_1569.74_1.088.wav_ASR	and it shouldn't happen
71-1_1571.64_7.02.wav_ASR	and so he grabs the chair looks out the window to find the cupboard who did this to him
71-1_1578.75_3.64.wav_ASR	oh no they're going to be some kind of
71-1_1582.51_3.18.wav_ASR	he's gonna need some kind of repetitions that are made and applied
71-1_1585.938_20.64.wav_ASR	he looks like he's about ready to head over grab the boy and head over to the boy parents to try to figure out how he would get his apartment and the promise that the the neighbor boy would never do the same thing again would stay away from the window where he would get his apartment and the promise that the neighbor boy would never do the same thing again would stay away from the window
71-1_1623.92_0.5.wav_ASR	oh
71-1_1624.855_4.46.wav_ASR	well it looks as if this little girl
71-1_1630.595_1.88.wav_ASR	let's see
71-1_1632.686_1.727.wav_ASR	hard actually it couldn't be kind of
71-1_1635.675_3.5.wav_ASR	can't decide if it's male or female
71-1_1639.515_3.031.wav_ASR	thank you very much
71-1_1643.288_9.44.wav_ASR	they's getting ready to head out to the library somewhere some trip somewhere
71-1_1653.76_5.85.wav_ASR	and their mother looked outside and said
71-1_1660.248_1.642.wav_ASR	oh i think we're gonna see some rain
71-1_1662.48_1.17.wav_ASR	you might need the umbrella
71-1_1664.82_1.11.wav_ASR	but this child says
71-1_1666.34_1.55.wav_ASR	they don't need an umbrella
71-1_1668.44_1.2.wav_ASR	meanwhile this's ridiculous
71-1_1669.94_0.6.wav_ASR	he's not gonna rain
71-1_1670.78_1.68.wav_ASR	and i don't really care about getting
71-1_1672.82_0.87.wav_ASR	you know i don't
71-1_1674.76_0.73.wav_ASR	oh not like shoe
71-1_1675.74_1.68.wav_ASR	they don't meet when the water hits them
71-1_1678.28_1.97.wav_ASR	so this this child says
71-1_1680.78_0.88.wav_ASR	oh leaving anyway
71-1_1681.66_1.72.wav_ASR	hey it's the umbrella
71-1_1683.529_1.775.wav_ASR	immediately began to rain
71-1_1686.38_1.31.wav_ASR	all of a sudden
71-1_1688.02_4.78.wav_ASR	hey i'm getting ramps in my eyes
71-1_1693.33_1.4.wav_ASR	and i'm getting really wet
71-1_1695.36_1.22.wav_ASR	but this is not
71-1_1697.22_2.14.wav_ASR	and i didn't understand that it was getting in my eyes
71-1_1700.24_4.96.wav_ASR	so i immediately headed back because it was raining much harder than i thought it was
71-1_1706.08_0.654.wav_ASR	laughing
71-1_1706.84_0.896.wav_ASR	they're my mother
71-1_1708.14_1.485.wav_ASR	just looked at her
71-1_1710.54_2.22.wav_ASR	and she of course knew that i was right
71-1_1713.18_11.1.wav_ASR	the mother immediately understood that while it was very difficult for this child to ask for it or to acknowledge that they were wrong
71-1_1725.08_5.08.wav_ASR	they did make clear that they didn't need need umbrella if they were gonna be walking to the library
71-1_1730.64_3.56.wav_ASR	so the mother then gave them the umbrella
71-1_1734.68_10.14.wav_ASR	and they went back on their way with an umbrella remembering at this point that maybe mothers actually know what they're talking about what they're saying
71-1_1761.65_0.5.wav_ASR	yeah
71-1_1762.547_29.94.wav_ASR	well what happened is that the cat that belongs to the little girl ran up in a tree and became to me how it did wanna get off the tree but no longer knew how to get back from the end of the branch that
71-1_1800.778_0.579.wav_ASR	help me
71-1_1802.158_0.382.wav_ASR	me
71-1_1802.54_6.1.wav_ASR	and the little girl is obviously just really embarrassing about the situation of her cat
71-1_1808.838_1.772.wav_ASR	he's very worried about getting her cat
71-1_1811.358_5.082.wav_ASR	so she began by going to her father and say
71-1_1816.78_4.1.wav_ASR	can you please help me get the cat out of the tree
71-1_1820.94_4.437.wav_ASR	and the
71-1_1825.6_0.417.wav_ASR	horse
71-1_1826.1_18.22.wav_ASR	and he grabbed his ladder and put it against the tree and climbed up but could not get back up to the the limb where the cat was because those branches are too far
71-1_1845.67_8.6.wav_ASR	he also eventually kicked off the ladder which then puts him back in a situation that he needs to be rescued
71-1_1855.03_5.868.wav_ASR	so at this point the dog is now barking because the dog wants the father to get out of the tree
71-1_1861.6_10.368.wav_ASR	the barking of the dog is making it more difficult for the cat to be able to inch its way back down to the trunk
71-1_1872.9_8.052.wav_ASR	so the little girl is still really really dressed because her child her cat is
71-1_1880.952_2.68.wav_ASR	that's a semantic paragraph error
71-1_1883.772_0.899.wav_ASR	make that all the time
71-1_1885.192_3.057.wav_ASR	is really wants her cat to be able to get out
71-1_1888.249_17.88.wav_ASR	so they call the fire department to come down and not just rescue the cat but also rescue since he now needs also to be rescued since his attempt at putting the ladder against the tree wasn't helpful
71-1_1906.179_13.419.wav_ASR	but it it does absolutely shows that the father was really trying to do whatever his daughter wanted him to do instead of helping out the cat out of the tree
71-1_1939.75_0.39.wav_ASR	shoe
71-1_2104.158_2.744.wav_ASR	oh i'll keep the feedback critique out of it
71-1_2107.478_3.16.wav_ASR	but i'll be next time around
71-1_2113.118_0.492.wav_ASR	yes
71-1_2113.85_8.89.wav_ASR	and cinderella is she's the daughter of a witch
71-1_2123.66_2.76.wav_ASR	her mother has been killed
71-1_2127.23_2.66.wav_ASR	and so the two of them are
71-1_2131.04_13.9.wav_ASR	and the her father decides that it would be really helpful for his daughter if he could provide a mother for his daughter
71-1_2146.02_1.74.wav_ASR	so he met this
71-1_2149.12_2.03.wav_ASR	and i don't know that we've ever heard her name
71-1_2151.74_3.0.wav_ASR	but anyway others know it
71-1_2155.58_6.48.wav_ASR	made very clear that she would be a wonderful mother to cinderella
71-1_2162.44_1.851.wav_ASR	two she also had two daughters of her own
71-1_2165.48_1.34.wav_ASR	oh they
71-1_2167.42_10.34.wav_ASR	and unfortunately the way that cinderella was treated was not appropriate
71-1_2178.36_5.417.wav_ASR	and she was not treated the same way that the stepmother's daughters were treated
71-1_2183.777_4.48.wav_ASR	and instead she was used as a maid
71-1_2188.336_5.469.wav_ASR	and i have no idea where her father is in this whole picture and why he's not doing anything about this
71-1_2194.037_3.593.wav_ASR	but maybe he's traveling or he's gone or whatever
71-1_2197.83_17.72.wav_ASR	but he's left the management of his daughter to this stepmother who treats her very badly doesn't treat her the same and has given the message to her daughters that it is fine to treat cinderella
71-1_2216.67_10.5.wav_ASR	so she effectively becomes the maid to these two stepsisters and to stepmother
71-1_2228.39_5.92.wav_ASR	but she she's a very very sweet young woman
71-1_2235.23_16.92.wav_ASR	and she's found away to also have happiness and stability relationships with the animals because that's one of her jobs as a maid is to make sure that the animals are happy and stable relationships with the animals
71-1_2252.39_1.84.wav_ASR	so she sings
71-1_2255.14_0.93.wav_ASR	they love her
71-1_2256.32_5.39.wav_ASR	he's close to the the horses the other animals
71-1_2262.1_9.26.wav_ASR	and she dreams about being in better situation where she's loved and is treated with more respect than she is
71-1_2271.67_11.59.wav_ASR	oh she's so quite beautiful which is certainly one of the reasons why the stepsisters are so mean to her because they are not anywhere near as attractive as she is
71-1_2284.39_18.53.wav_ASR	but well this is going on in this whole hold the king of the kingdom has made it clear to his son that it's time for him to marry because the king would like to retire
71-1_2303.08_7.52.wav_ASR	and he'd like to hand down the kingdom to his son
71-1_2311.32_1.88.wav_ASR	but first his son hasta marry
71-1_2313.84_2.509.wav_ASR	and he doesn't really want her
71-1_2316.62_1.587.wav_ASR	he's not interesting to anyone
71-1_2318.34_1.38.wav_ASR	he's not dancing anyone
71-1_2320.22_3.01.wav_ASR	but the plan is that this is his shoe
71-1_2324.16_3.094.wav_ASR	he was kinda like the prince hairy of that time
71-1_2327.3_3.0.wav_ASR	the spear and not the woman
71-1_2331.06_5.74.wav_ASR	but in any case the plan is that there's gonna be a giant ball a dance
71-1_2336.832_13.545.wav_ASR	and all of the elementary which i guess means of child bearing years are sposta show up at this dance so that he can pick the one that he wants
71-1_2350.732_4.303.wav_ASR	and again we will not get into the faculty critique how this all work
71-1_2356.58_2.034.wav_ASR	finally the word gets out
71-1_2359.36_6.948.wav_ASR	the two stepsisters are just really excited about this idea because they're the right age
71-1_2366.94_9.235.wav_ASR	because their mother had married cinderella's father who makes a fair amount of money they can dress really well
71-1_2376.175_11.163.wav_ASR	oh they can really get dressed up to go to this dance and see if they could be the one that would attract the the attention of the prince
71-1_2388.615_1.676.wav_ASR	the cinderella wants to go
71-1_2390.815_3.322.wav_ASR	three she also reads about this that that is coming
71-1_2394.137_3.18.wav_ASR	and she knows she's eligible because she's the right age
71-1_2397.537_6.18.wav_ASR	and i guess she's of that nationality or whatever criteria they use
71-1_2404.5_6.33.wav_ASR	but her stepmother kind of makes clear that no she's not invited to go
71-1_2411.78_5.16.wav_ASR	three she's not gonna be able to go to stores and buy clothes the way that were
71-1_2417.82_2.25.wav_ASR	so she tries to make something on her own
71-1_2420.4_3.38.wav_ASR	he tries to take the minutes and the rags that are available
71-1_2424.24_4.62.wav_ASR	he looks up how to make them in a
71-1_2429.36_1.08.wav_ASR	it was on page eight
71-1_2430.56_1.38.wav_ASR	and i think that's what was coming in there
71-1_2432.61_1.33.wav_ASR	and she comes up with the dress
71-1_2434.24_1.5.wav_ASR	and of course she looks amazing
71-1_2436.71_9.244.wav_ASR	it's were pretty and pink the film with firstnamem firstnamer firstnamew she got away with him
71-1_2446.2_1.78.wav_ASR	but this is not
71-1_2449.65_1.12.wav_ASR	three this is cinderella
71-1_2450.992_2.458.wav_ASR	so her mother laugh at her and says
71-1_2453.57_1.49.wav_ASR	now not going out with those clothes
71-1_2455.45_2.61.wav_ASR	and her stepsisters mock her
71-1_2458.95_2.32.wav_ASR	and she's out in the barn by her
71-1_2462.19_9.66.wav_ASR	and all the sudden this fairy godmother shows up based on one of her wishes
71-1_2472.03_2.42.wav_ASR	my wife i could go to the ball
71-1_2475.65_12.128.wav_ASR	and she the reason that the hurry sorry fairy godmother is showing up is because she knows that cinderella is a really sweet young girl
71-1_2488.53_2.041.wav_ASR	and she cares about everybody else
71-1_2490.87_1.674.wav_ASR	and she does things for everybody else
71-1_2492.544_4.96.wav_ASR	and because of the personality of her heart she discovers this chance
71-1_2498.584_2.36.wav_ASR	so she uses her magical powers
71-1_2502.18_6.324.wav_ASR	and she not only creates a dress for her that is incredibly ornate
71-1_2509.124_2.72.wav_ASR	you can go to the upstairs with me
71-1_2511.9_14.753.wav_ASR	but she also transforms the mice into horses and the pumpkin into carriage to be able to take her so that she can get there
71-1_2526.84_2.1.wav_ASR	and she can ride in style
71-1_2529.78_4.64.wav_ASR	so cinderella is very very happy hugs her
71-1_2534.78_0.88.wav_ASR	her mother's saying
71-1_2535.86_5.98.wav_ASR	remember this only will last until midnight
71-1_2542.26_4.463.wav_ASR	at midnight your dress will go back to your rag
71-1_2546.723_5.94.wav_ASR	legs your feet's will be transferred back into
71-1_2554.163_6.318.wav_ASR	and the carriage will be transported back into a pumpkin
71-1_2561.13_0.573.wav_ASR	and she says
71-1_2561.943_0.442.wav_ASR	so i know
71-1_2562.423_0.792.wav_ASR	thank you very much
71-1_2563.463_3.157.wav_ASR	so she he's to the the ball
71-1_2567.38_17.24.wav_ASR	and of course because she is so elegant attractive and shows up with this really real real type of carriage she's treated as royalty
71-1_2584.975_2.916.wav_ASR	the footman opens the door
71-1_2588.095_0.812.wav_ASR	help help
71-1_2589.635_0.812.wav_ASR	and she walks in
71-1_2590.635_2.32.wav_ASR	immediately the prince just like
71-1_2593.435_0.658.wav_ASR	slip that
71-1_2594.515_2.3.wav_ASR	he's been struck by lightning
71-1_2597.575_1.165.wav_ASR	he's the one i wanna be with
71-1_2598.975_1.165.wav_ASR	he heads over to her
71-1_2600.475_2.06.wav_ASR	there's an incident
71-1_2604.46_2.0.wav_ASR	he dances with her the entire night
71-1_2606.82_5.16.wav_ASR	he's pretty clear that maybe at this point marriage is the worst thing in the world if i get to be with this one
71-1_2613.19_4.0.wav_ASR	and all of a sudden at this point she's pulling away
71-1_2617.56_0.34.wav_ASR	he says
71-1_2618.12_0.46.wav_ASR	oh i got a
71-1_2618.76_0.34.wav_ASR	excuse me
71-1_2619.22_1.32.wav_ASR	oh oh stick around
71-1_2620.94_0.6.wav_ASR	you got the umbrella
71-1_2622.58_0.6.wav_ASR	let's see
71-1_2624.18_1.12.wav_ASR	and she said
71-1_2625.6_0.71.wav_ASR	oh i gotta get back
71-1_2626.5_0.52.wav_ASR	oh i gotta go
71-1_2627.3_5.8.wav_ASR	and she runs away at about two or three minutes to midnight because her she says
71-1_2633.26_1.166.wav_ASR	and i i got this curve you know
71-1_2634.56_0.786.wav_ASR	and i got to go away
71-1_2635.38_1.167.wav_ASR	and she races away
71-1_2637.7_2.81.wav_ASR	all of a sudden she's she's a really fast
71-1_2640.94_0.44.wav_ASR	so she's
71-1_2641.38_4.57.wav_ASR	way but all the sudden he sees that one of his shoes has been left there
71-1_2646.16_0.98.wav_ASR	glass slipper
71-1_2647.86_2.174.wav_ASR	and so he picks that up
71-1_2650.2_3.24.wav_ASR	that's all he's got of her is this glass slipper
71-1_2654.1_2.56.wav_ASR	so he goes back to his father and says
71-1_2657.28_1.28.wav_ASR	oh marry somebody
71-1_2658.86_1.868.wav_ASR	there's only one woman i wanna marry
71-1_2660.728_1.516.wav_ASR	and she's the one i wanna marry
71-1_2662.968_4.68.wav_ASR	and all i have is this clue that her foot will fit into this shoe
71-1_2668.928_2.54.wav_ASR	it's part adventure around the kingdom
71-1_2672.608_7.36.wav_ASR	one who's feet will fit into these slippers the prince will see if it's a contemporary
71-1_2680.85_7.16.wav_ASR	oh the stepsisters who you know they were annoyed at the ball
71-1_2688.27_2.82.wav_ASR	but they pretty sure they get their feet into this slipper
71-1_2692.05_1.6.wav_ASR	he one of the king
71-1_2694.54_19.21.wav_ASR	so he's and and of course at this point cinderella's back doing her work taking care of the animals cleaning in the kitchen once again just decorated and enrolled and treated respectfully by her family
71-1_2714.59_1.81.wav_ASR	so the prince starts driving around
71-1_2716.91_4.25.wav_ASR	well and it's this really boring sort of thing that he's driving around
71-1_2721.43_10.724.wav_ASR	people are running out taking off their shoes and seeing if they will fit into this slipper which is apparently designed specifically to fit this one single one
71-1_2733.67_1.9.wav_ASR	and he hands up and he stops at their house
71-1_2735.77_6.34.wav_ASR	he's really discouraged this point because he hasn't yet found a woman who's fit into that category
71-1_2743.01_1.095.wav_ASR	he stops at this house
71-1_2744.37_2.793.wav_ASR	oh the stepsisters do everything they can
71-1_2747.29_3.08.wav_ASR	but they're feet are just too big or too long or
71-1_2750.71_0.798.wav_ASR	it's not working
71-1_2751.632_3.22.wav_ASR	and then all of a sudden
71-1_2755.261_2.278.wav_ASR	he's just about ready to leave
71-1_2757.592_1.74.wav_ASR	all of a sudden he sees a movement
71-1_2760.172_5.59.wav_ASR	and he sees this other woman liked the maid who's just in the corner
71-1_2766.572_0.428.wav_ASR	and he says
71-1_2767.252_0.588.wav_ASR	don't hurt
71-1_2768.83_1.36.wav_ASR	and the stepmother's saying
71-1_2770.312_0.798.wav_ASR	oh she's no
71-1_2771.5_0.97.wav_ASR	he's our mate
71-1_2773.43_1.84.wav_ASR	and she looks up
71-1_2775.92_5.43.wav_ASR	he the prince just has this strange feeling about her and
71-1_2781.92_1.44.wav_ASR	it's like to have her come out
71-1_2783.78_7.311.wav_ASR	and i'd like to see if if the slippers will fit her feet
71-1_2791.091_2.035.wav_ASR	and so she comes home
71-1_2793.371_0.92.wav_ASR	he's a mess
71-1_2794.711_3.639.wav_ASR	you know she's been working in the kitchen and and in the ball
71-1_2798.931_6.2.wav_ASR	and she's you know not not looking anywhere like the princess person that had been at the ball
71-1_2805.87_0.8.wav_ASR	but she came out
71-1_2806.831_0.759.wav_ASR	and she's set down
71-1_2808.51_3.56.wav_ASR	the prince put the slipper on her foot
71-1_2812.99_1.08.wav_ASR	and it fit
71-1_2814.73_0.98.wav_ASR	and then he looked at her
71-1_2815.71_22.48.wav_ASR	and what was remarkable is that he was able to look beyond all of the paperwork of the wealth that she had shown the first time he'd met her to see that it was exactly the same person even if she was clearly not of the same stature that she that he assumed you knew her to see that it was exactly the same person even if she was clearly not of the same stature
71-1_2839.43_15.337.wav_ASR	so they happily after until just like prince harry somehow the poppy eye did not like the cinderella because she was not of high enough status
71-1_2854.767_18.19.wav_ASR	and he hadta return his crown and go to another conference and yeah and then start writing proceeding meeting notes notes and then start writing the report writing meeting notes about his celebration to make money
71-1_2872.957_0.84.wav_ASR	alright
71-1_2874.864_1.272.wav_ASR	oh yeah
71-1_2900.37_0.5.wav_ASR	okay
71-1_2905.61_1.0.wav_ASR	oh
71-1_2910.67_11.58.wav_ASR	an interesting really interesting thing about clocks to me recently is that i went to a physical check
71-1_2923.03_2.831.wav_ASR	and i'd just turn sixty five
71-1_2926.39_2.52.wav_ASR	so i had never experienced this before
71-1_2929.05_5.28.wav_ASR	and i thought it was my annual physical
71-1_2935.52_1.03.wav_ASR	and i walked home
71-1_2936.75_0.57.wav_ASR	and i sat down
71-1_2937.65_2.34.wav_ASR	the nurse is checking my blood pressure
71-1_2940.41_4.62.wav_ASR	and she's working you know the my heart rate rise and all the other stuff
71-1_2945.73_3.06.wav_ASR	and then she handed me a piece of paper and a pen and said
71-1_2948.98_1.34.wav_ASR	hadta like you to draw a clock
71-1_2951.06_1.01.wav_ASR	oh i love you
71-1_2953.58_0.57.wav_ASR	and she says
71-1_2954.34_3.38.wav_ASR	because i i wanna see what kind of picture you you can draw
71-1_2958.32_2.76.wav_ASR	so it seems ridiculous
71-1_2961.62_1.027.wav_ASR	but i did it anyway
71-1_2963.0_0.93.wav_ASR	oh i just
71-1_2964.52_9.32.wav_ASR	and i knew how to handle how to draw a picture apparently with a clock which you first you put down the twelve
71-1_2974.0_0.89.wav_ASR	and then you put down the slipper
71-1_2975.14_0.66.wav_ASR	and you put the bread
71-1_2975.98_0.71.wav_ASR	they put them in
71-1_2976.74_8.82.wav_ASR	and then you fill in the number so that everything is located where it should be instead of you know having them too crowded
71-1_2986.12_3.09.wav_ASR	and then i hadta draw the pictures of two forty five
71-1_2990.32_1.08.wav_ASR	and i finish it
71-1_2991.6_0.4.wav_ASR	and i said
71-1_2992.42_1.46.wav_ASR	oh is this what you want
71-1_2994.75_4.17.wav_ASR	or did you wanna just look at what you have on the wall that's right there which is a
71-1_2999.82_0.95.wav_ASR	and she said
71-1_3001.11_2.02.wav_ASR	well you have passed this test
71-1_3003.49_0.32.wav_ASR	and she says
71-1_3004.28_1.87.wav_ASR	he was essentially a demotee
71-1_3006.254_13.939.wav_ASR	that when you're sixty five and you go to see a an apartment for an annual check you will hafta draw a lock
71-1_3020.834_0.477.wav_ASR	and i said
71-1_3021.514_2.193.wav_ASR	one point will they stop doing this
71-1_3023.76_9.43.wav_ASR	because well i did improve with the you know the round clock right you know
71-1_3033.8_1.68.wav_ASR	everything i do is digital
71-1_3035.807_16.95.wav_ASR	so what happens at what generation will they decide that you do not have demnesia or whatever and that you simply have a digital understanding of of what time is
71-1_3053.5_2.36.wav_ASR	so anyway if i do it i'm not gonna do it again
71-1_3056.16_6.11.wav_ASR	maybe just mess with them and just put down some digital stuff and see what they do
71-1_3062.88_3.78.wav_ASR	my my p p a or something like brooklyn
71-1_3066.9_2.818.wav_ASR	but anyway it's it's it's test that they do
71-1_3069.718_3.888.wav_ASR	and i found it really irritating though i passed
71-1_3074.018_3.915.wav_ASR	the it's it's gonna be absolutely very very quickly
71-1_3078.438_1.048.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
71-1_3084.638_1.963.wav_ASR	oh let me see
71-1_3091.487_18.88.wav_ASR	one of the things i useta do when my daughter was younger is every january usually the first week and january we would head together to watch the eagle watch
71-1_3110.83_14.71.wav_ASR	and what the evil witch was is north of here on the way somewhere else
71-1_3125.67_0.72.wav_ASR	they're coming back
71-1_3126.63_1.247.wav_ASR	they're going south or something
71-1_3127.877_5.666.wav_ASR	but they all show up in this leg for about three or four days
71-1_3134.157_8.44.wav_ASR	and so what people do is they have groups the audubon society and other groups that show up with
71-1_3144.23_4.65.wav_ASR	and we watch the the birds because you can see them
71-1_3149.19_1.113.wav_ASR	they're really really close
71-1_3150.45_1.46.wav_ASR	you can see the
71-1_3152.49_1.454.wav_ASR	and you can see them with their mother
71-1_3154.33_2.28.wav_ASR	and there's just so many of them at one time
71-1_3157.17_2.038.wav_ASR	it was once we have a lot of hurt
71-1_3159.43_4.8.wav_ASR	but we don't necessarily see ball eagles as much
71-1_3164.36_1.23.wav_ASR	it's much more rare
71-1_3166.48_4.788.wav_ASR	that's something that we did for a number of years
71-1_3171.36_2.94.wav_ASR	even when she was thirteen and wasn't really talking to them anymore
71-1_3174.98_2.763.wav_ASR	we always had fun on that day
71-1_3177.96_0.725.wav_ASR	they were shivering
71-1_3179.02_3.122.wav_ASR	first she dresses really really warm because it's gonna be twenty below
71-1_3182.59_3.58.wav_ASR	we would go to the bank with firstnamem
71-1_3186.63_2.08.wav_ASR	we would wait for the eggs to shell up
71-1_3188.91_1.44.wav_ASR	we would watch them for awhile
71-1_3190.65_2.38.wav_ASR	and then we would go have hot coffee
71-1_3193.31_2.86.wav_ASR	and she will talk you know during that time
71-1_3196.61_2.19.wav_ASR	when we were home that it was
71-1_3199.11_0.88.wav_ASR	oh god she's my mother
71-1_3200.21_0.568.wav_ASR	talk to you
71-1_3200.778_1.896.wav_ASR	don't talk to my friends
71-1_3202.738_13.726.wav_ASR	but there was always that one period even in those very very difficult early years that my always talked to me after we watched the eagles
71-1_3216.464_5.16.wav_ASR	so that's one of the things that i would think of when i think of the word bird
71-1_3227.38_1.01.wav_ASR	what what was the word again
71-1_3230.244_2.56.wav_ASR	oh i don't know if you wanna hear that story
71-1_3233.039_0.485.wav_ASR	oh
71-1_3233.991_2.78.wav_ASR	well i okay
71-1_3236.777_13.094.wav_ASR	and i can tell you a recent one that will clearly not be ready or or anything because really when you start getting that one it could be way more interesting
71-1_3250.021_10.775.wav_ASR	well talk about something i did last summer since my stroke i've been trying to push myself a little bit
71-1_3260.881_2.569.wav_ASR	again i'm i'm much more tired than i useta be
71-1_3263.61_5.251.wav_ASR	but i'm still trying to push my boundaries to find out exactly what's possible
71-1_3268.93_1.28.wav_ASR	oh and how much can i do
71-1_3270.29_1.827.wav_ASR	and help long can i drive
71-1_3272.13_3.6.wav_ASR	and how many hours a day can i you know be active
71-1_3275.741_2.789.wav_ASR	and so i work with this non-profit
71-1_3279.53_5.7.wav_ASR	and we were having a event in northern wisconsin off the amateur reserve
71-1_3285.397_2.48.wav_ASR	and it's our our group is called wedding
71-1_3289.337_1.68.wav_ASR	we do with m m i doubt you
71-1_3291.677_3.779.wav_ASR	so i i head up for this wealth of knowledge
71-1_3295.737_1.06.wav_ASR	and i hadta get up
71-1_3296.957_5.26.wav_ASR	think i left town at five to get up there by eight
71-1_3302.331_5.519.wav_ASR	we had a event all day long and talking and you know different things going on
71-1_3307.891_1.32.wav_ASR	it was really really hot
71-1_3310.051_3.538.wav_ASR	and i was ready to drive home by five o'clock
71-1_3314.151_2.269.wav_ASR	about an hour on the way
71-1_3317.011_2.559.wav_ASR	it's about three and a half hour trip
71-1_3319.71_2.98.wav_ASR	five i decided i can't drive anymore too
71-1_3323.47_1.68.wav_ASR	my head was just
71-1_3326.15_3.68.wav_ASR	and i needed to sleep really really quickly
71-1_3329.87_2.42.wav_ASR	have learned to listen to myself
71-1_3332.61_4.86.wav_ASR	my body says you pull over and you run
71-1_3337.649_5.112.wav_ASR	you don't just like four around through and you keep on going
71-1_3343.27_1.34.wav_ASR	so i pulled into this hotel
71-1_3345.85_1.66.wav_ASR	it i luckily i found him
71-1_3347.849_3.041.wav_ASR	you know i didn't have a reservation or anything
71-1_3351.11_9.614.wav_ASR	and i was just looking for a place that had opening so i could go in and get out of the sun and you know cover my eyes and not hafta drive anymore
71-1_3360.85_10.96.wav_ASR	but because i was as tired as i was and because i was pushed to my boundaries my aphasia had clearly flared
71-1_3372.95_2.18.wav_ASR	so i walked in this
71-1_3375.69_3.36.wav_ASR	and they were lots of i mean clearly they're a lot of vacation
71-1_3379.64_2.57.wav_ASR	well except i didn't know that right away
71-1_3382.66_1.98.wav_ASR	but i thought it said beacons
71-1_3385.14_0.809.wav_ASR	but i wasn't sure
71-1_3386.18_0.937.wav_ASR	and i walked in the door
71-1_3388.0_2.42.wav_ASR	and there's this woman behind the the dress
71-1_3390.82_0.48.wav_ASR	and i said
71-1_3391.54_2.24.wav_ASR	you know i'm here for a room
71-1_3394.62_0.32.wav_ASR	and i said
71-1_3395.02_1.08.wav_ASR	do you have any vacation
71-1_3397.62_5.68.wav_ASR	and and of course that's what happens with aphasia is you say word
71-1_3403.92_3.86.wav_ASR	and no vaccinations could have been administered a response to covid
71-1_3408.16_3.161.wav_ASR	people are wearing masks
71-1_3411.64_1.783.wav_ASR	and they're being very careful about that
71-1_3413.72_2.58.wav_ASR	but so of course i was trying to say
71-1_3416.34_1.56.wav_ASR	they have a
71-1_3418.62_1.778.wav_ASR	oh well you know what
71-1_3420.7_1.02.wav_ASR	you have a vacation
71-1_3422.16_3.26.wav_ASR	and they went into her closet
71-1_3426.26_1.62.wav_ASR	yeah everybody here's been evacuated
71-1_3428.38_0.711.wav_ASR	yeah we're mad
71-1_3429.38_0.988.wav_ASR	wife everything down
71-1_3430.72_0.54.wav_ASR	and i'm just saying
71-1_3431.88_0.98.wav_ASR	so you have a room
71-1_3433.14_0.664.wav_ASR	and she said
71-1_3433.92_1.033.wav_ASR	yes yes yes
71-1_3435.16_0.545.wav_ASR	don't worry
71-1_3435.705_1.0.wav_ASR	we follow the cops
71-1_3436.845_0.623.wav_ASR	and don't worry
71-1_3437.565_1.797.wav_ASR	oh you're not gonna get it here
71-1_3439.805_1.863.wav_ASR	the she gave me a umbrella
71-1_3441.825_6.66.wav_ASR	and i realized that was one way to cover things up is you just go with it you know
71-1_3448.76_1.911.wav_ASR	if she had a vacation
71-1_3451.44_0.31.wav_ASR	five i said
71-1_3452.165_0.98.wav_ASR	you have a backpack
71-1_3453.98_1.77.wav_ASR	and so we just met with back and forth
71-1_3456.24_2.03.wav_ASR	and then finally i went my way back
71-1_3459.14_2.56.wav_ASR	you have an empty room that i can sleep in
71-1_3462.68_5.02.wav_ASR	so i got in the room went in dark a lot of cold water and a little step for twelve
71-1_3468.94_0.48.wav_ASR	yeah
71-1_3471.54_2.08.wav_ASR	so that's that's another stroke
71-1_3478.5_0.5.wav_ASR	yeah
71-1_3480.14_0.8.wav_ASR	oh
71-1_3481.62_20.94.wav_ASR	oh i guess if i were going to choose something to talk about research i would talk about how i paid my way through my undergraduate career which is through
71-1_3504.63_14.68.wav_ASR	at at kind of little coffee shop that was near where i lived because i had no car
71-1_3520.12_1.31.wav_ASR	and i could just bike there
71-1_3522.42_1.45.wav_ASR	and they were very very kind
71-1_3524.03_2.94.wav_ASR	and i did the exercise
71-1_3528.1_14.32.wav_ASR	but i learned very quickly after about six months that you would get paid ten to fifteen percent as a tip based on the the prices of the restaurants
71-1_3543.14_8.24.wav_ASR	what made sense was to find the restaurant that was the most expensive in terms of prices and were there
71-1_3552.167_3.873.wav_ASR	excuse me i'm doing the exact same same part of service
71-1_3556.39_19.218.wav_ASR	oh if they're only paying five dollars for their meal and they're handing you fifty cents that's gonna be nearly as good as if they spent twenty dollars for it
71-1_3575.98_5.36.wav_ASR	so what i learned to do is keep going to more and more and more extensive research
71-1_3582.46_20.82.wav_ASR	the the the the maybe unold story is the weddings that work in the the really high you know high prices
71-1_3604.84_2.74.wav_ASR	so that's what i ended up doing
71-1_3608.2_4.664.wav_ASR	but again it what was so interesting to me is that i worked just as hard
71-1_3613.32_4.157.wav_ASR	and i use the same sort of you know
71-1_3618.84_5.61.wav_ASR	you hafta sort of keep a reviewing list of task that you're in the middle of doing
71-1_3624.45_1.994.wav_ASR	well you're going to the bar to drink
71-1_3626.65_1.508.wav_ASR	you're going here to get your foot
71-1_3628.39_1.405.wav_ASR	you're gonna go people more water
71-1_3630.11_0.946.wav_ASR	you're gonna give me your check
71-1_3631.51_5.578.wav_ASR	you hafta keep them all kind of revolving all the time
71-1_3637.31_4.757.wav_ASR	trying to decide exactly how you're going to prioritize each task
71-1_3642.067_10.0.wav_ASR	it's it's really meaning being waving being waving is a really meaningful celebration
71-1_3653.687_3.66.wav_ASR	it's just blur that they don't pay people any money to do that
71-1_3657.49_4.33.wav_ASR	but i was lucky because i made enough money that i was still able to graduate
71-1_3662.01_8.22.wav_ASR	and i wasn't paying the degree of the the amount of money that grand students and undergrads are paying now which is out
71-1_3672.05_0.61.wav_ASR	oh
71-1_3673.93_2.38.wav_ASR	yeah oh it's for my umbrella
71-1_3676.61_1.701.wav_ASR	graduation that was very different
71-1_3678.311_5.3.wav_ASR	but yeah i had no student loans because i worked as a waitress in restaurant
71-1_3698.06_0.59.wav_ASR	yeah you know
71-1_3699.03_2.999.wav_ASR	and it's it's really mentally kind of like
71-1_3703.14_1.235.wav_ASR	you got you know three minutes
71-1_3704.68_0.709.wav_ASR	can go get that
71-1_3705.62_0.591.wav_ASR	and i go to the
71-1_3706.54_0.366.wav_ASR	umbrella
71-1_3707.62_2.536.wav_ASR	it's it's kind of a challenge
71-1_3710.2_0.816.wav_ASR	it's kind of fun
71-1_3713.34_0.455.wav_ASR	yeah
71-1_3718.76_0.845.wav_ASR	you can kinda see it
71-1_3719.76_0.59.wav_ASR	they need water
71-1_3720.7_1.28.wav_ASR	you need more coffee over there
71-1_3722.26_0.96.wav_ASR	you got this going on
71-1_3723.52_4.32.wav_ASR	and i will say that the second place i worked i care a lot
71-1_3728.62_8.414.wav_ASR	and when i went in to get a physical they were trying to figure out why this mug on this arm was stronger than this one
71-1_3738.16_0.74.wav_ASR	they're something going on
71-1_3739.09_0.75.wav_ASR	they're grown
71-1_3739.97_0.49.wav_ASR	and i said
71-1_3740.68_1.82.wav_ASR	and i'm just really really strong
71-1_3743.1_1.92.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
71-1_3753.971_14.825.wav_ASR	well if i were going to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich i would begin by pulling out the bread
71-1_3769.311_2.802.wav_ASR	and taking out two slices of bread
71-1_3772.113_2.019.wav_ASR	and and lay them on the table
71-1_3774.633_8.24.wav_ASR	then i would go and get the jar of jelly and the jar of peanut butter
71-1_3783.713_4.173.wav_ASR	and i would bring probably a spoon and a knife with me
71-1_3788.57_2.863.wav_ASR	and i would begin with the peanut butter and
71-1_3792.068_2.272.wav_ASR	it's really difficult word to say his name
71-1_3794.488_0.84.wav_ASR	peanut butter
71-1_3796.268_4.045.wav_ASR	and i would spread that on one side of the bread
71-1_3800.828_3.96.wav_ASR	the other piece of bread i would put on
71-1_3805.108_1.06.wav_ASR	we would use a spoon
71-1_3806.568_1.011.wav_ASR	and i would pull out the jar
71-1_3807.92_4.373.wav_ASR	and i would spread that evenly on that piece of bread
71-1_3812.7_2.72.wav_ASR	then i would close the two of them together
71-1_3816.12_6.32.wav_ASR	and i would close screw the tops back on the jelly and the peanut butter
71-1_3822.66_0.63.wav_ASR	put them away
71-1_3823.88_1.4.wav_ASR	and then i would eat my sandwich
71-1_3832.11_5.6.wav_ASR	well i don't do it often
71-1_3838.45_1.708.wav_ASR	oh well that's the whole thing
71-1_3840.85_15.069.wav_ASR	when i do my laundry describe the fact i do have washing machine downstairs i tend to go to the one laundry mat because i can do all of it at one time
71-1_3856.37_2.654.wav_ASR	and i only wanna do it once a week or every other week
71-1_3859.024_4.476.wav_ASR	because it's just something i find kinda boring to do
71-1_3863.904_3.04.wav_ASR	what i do is
71-1_3868.044_1.74.wav_ASR	five i hafta do this tomorrow
71-1_3870.184_1.23.wav_ASR	so let me think about this
71-1_3871.644_3.54.wav_ASR	all of my dirty clothes
71-1_3875.33_5.584.wav_ASR	and i usually use the smell test to find out whether they go into the hamper or not
71-1_3880.914_18.7.wav_ASR	and when i decide that everything needs to be washed which also will include the towels the washcloths and the other towels hand cloth hand clothes that are hanging up in the kitchen i would all of them in
71-1_3900.01_5.52.wav_ASR	use a container of liquid
71-1_3907.24_0.66.wav_ASR	and i would put that
71-1_3908.31_4.39.wav_ASR	would carry it to the back side of my the back seat of my car
71-1_3913.6_8.52.wav_ASR	and i would make sure i had quarters or had cash that i could use for the quarter money in the local currency
71-1_3923.11_1.57.wav_ASR	we would go to the laundry mat
71-1_3924.88_6.327.wav_ASR	the largest machine that was available that i could do all of my laundry at one time in one machine
71-1_3931.207_5.18.wav_ASR	and i would put the laundry in
71-1_3937.23_12.357.wav_ASR	if they didn't all it i would make sure that the clothing that could be worn at a lower temperature would go into a separate smaller washing machine
71-1_3950.36_1.814.wav_ASR	make sure the soup was in
71-1_3952.46_2.068.wav_ASR	make sure i had enough coins
71-1_3955.36_6.792.wav_ASR	and then i would probably go buy food or something they're being washed
71-1_3962.36_0.924.wav_ASR	come back
71-1_3963.54_1.44.wav_ASR	they're in the tree
71-1_3965.86_2.403.wav_ASR	oh i don't really follow them the way i'm sposta be
71-1_3968.54_0.71.wav_ASR	just a little
71-1_3969.66_4.29.wav_ASR	and then put them away kind of as i use them when i
71-1_3985.92_4.75.wav_ASR	you mean what would i choose to wear or
71-1_3995.3_0.57.wav_ASR	oh i see
71-1_3996.39_11.38.wav_ASR	well the first thing i would do every morning is start my coffee because that really is gonna hafta happen before i make decisions about what matches what
71-1_4008.33_2.38.wav_ASR	oh i was stuck
71-1_4011.9_2.75.wav_ASR	usually do the four over
71-1_4015.51_1.41.wav_ASR	and i really
71-1_4017.61_2.19.wav_ASR	so i usually would grind the coal
71-1_4020.33_1.78.wav_ASR	started the the water
71-1_4023.83_2.36.wav_ASR	oh i would go into my bed
71-1_4026.63_3.12.wav_ASR	generally i have some idea of what i'm gonna write
71-1_4030.63_3.28.wav_ASR	if only because i hafta dig stuff out sometimes
71-1_4033.91_1.26.wav_ASR	and i don't wanna have any
71-1_4035.602_4.45.wav_ASR	and i don't really have time to look a lot in the morning
71-1_4040.49_2.54.wav_ASR	so i'm gonna put it on a piece of what i'm gonna wear everyday
71-1_4043.51_5.14.wav_ASR	so i usually start well clear under
71-1_4049.59_3.481.wav_ASR	then whatever pants or skirt i'm wearing
71-1_4053.071_3.66.wav_ASR	that point it the water's usually ready
71-1_4057.231_2.079.wav_ASR	so yeah i got my lines clear
71-1_4059.631_10.319.wav_ASR	oh i'm running around here half dressed okay and then finishing out what kind of shirt i'm gonna wear whether and then trying to make decisions about how cold it
71-1_4070.191_1.359.wav_ASR	so i needta wear the umbrella
71-1_4071.75_1.32.wav_ASR	do i needta wear a white one
71-1_4073.07_2.819.wav_ASR	well the cop's being mad
71-1_4076.37_2.828.wav_ASR	but the time the cops made got all my basic clothes on
71-1_4079.87_6.666.wav_ASR	and then i take the coffee with me in the bathroom when i make decisions about ears and hair and all that other stuff
71-1_4086.94_4.822.wav_ASR	but yeah the basics are all established so i hafta worry about it
71-1_4091.79_5.715.wav_ASR	and if i absolutely am tired and don't know what i'm doing i just wear black because it matches everything
71-1_4098.11_1.432.wav_ASR	so i have a lot of black clothes
71-1_4100.07_0.77.wav_ASR	oh there's that
71-2_14.77_15.16.wav_ASR	and i think my favorite part about where i live and i live on the near side of mathematics about a mile away from the capital is that i'm close to the lake
71-2_30.89_1.34.wav_ASR	oh mathematics is a city
71-2_32.41_2.38.wav_ASR	we we have four different legs that are here
71-2_35.21_8.54.wav_ASR	and the mansion actually comes from a word from hoover that actually specifically means for real
71-2_44.69_5.4.wav_ASR	so a block away from where i live is late
71-2_50.725_3.302.wav_ASR	and it's the biggest of the lake
71-2_54.665_6.7.wav_ASR	and what i like the most about it is there's a bike path to my
71-2_62.83_6.42.wav_ASR	the leg is to my left with running part that goes along it
71-2_70.27_7.38.wav_ASR	and i literally can get pretty much everywhere that i needta go in the city of massachusetts without having to drive
71-2_79.43_1.82.wav_ASR	and i'm very close to the lake
71-2_82.17_4.02.wav_ASR	so one of the things i do when i run
71-2_86.95_2.98.wav_ASR	so now i would pretty much call it fast walking
71-2_90.071_3.86.wav_ASR	oh not not not from my
71-2_94.531_6.34.wav_ASR	in my prime i would run about seven or eight miles a morning
71-2_100.931_2.26.wav_ASR	and i would get it down over about seven minutes
71-2_103.351_3.4.wav_ASR	oh i'm pretty much just walking and walking
71-2_107.621_3.7.wav_ASR	and we're more like eleven minutes miles
71-2_111.741_2.56.wav_ASR	oh i usually get about five in every morning
71-2_114.621_7.309.wav_ASR	it's it's kind of mediocre in the sense that you can look at the word
71-2_122.181_1.029.wav_ASR	you can see the bird
71-2_123.87_10.3.wav_ASR	it's just much more satisfied that it would be to be on a tree
71-2_134.77_3.32.wav_ASR	so it's one of the things i really like about where i live
71-2_139.91_1.36.wav_ASR	the bread
71-2_142.244_0.5.wav_ASR	oh
71-2_144.217_0.467.wav_ASR	oh okay
71-2_144.93_1.073.wav_ASR	and i don't think that i'm
71-2_146.764_2.154.wav_ASR	well i'm not sure that's the right word that i mean
71-2_149.284_0.5.wav_ASR	five i mean
71-2_153.748_0.593.wav_ASR	oh what is it
71-2_155.384_1.306.wav_ASR	oh i just see the word
71-2_156.884_0.526.wav_ASR	but i kept saying
71-2_157.764_1.566.wav_ASR	oh i'm soaking that word out
71-2_159.584_0.92.wav_ASR	but no i wasn't
71-2_160.706_2.562.wav_ASR	sometimes i hear a word that i already know
71-2_163.426_0.544.wav_ASR	thank you
71-2_164.206_1.044.wav_ASR	that i'm saying that wrong
71-2_165.746_4.624.wav_ASR	but i i just hafta be reactive with words that i actually already knew
71-2_171.106_0.564.wav_ASR	oh yeah
71-2_173.086_3.54.wav_ASR	umbrella is much better than being on a tree
71-2_177.146_2.769.wav_ASR	and i went to the block away which is why i like living here
71-2_179.915_0.5.wav_ASR	yeah
71-2_200.31_2.58.wav_ASR	again my speech is not reliable
71-2_204.23_8.987.wav_ASR	but the most part when i speak i know what i'm going to say
71-2_213.77_16.481.wav_ASR	but if i try to say something that's more complicated something that is explaining something in more detail or becomes more explicit explicit my words don't come out the way that i like to say them
71-2_230.251_8.589.wav_ASR	or the words are in my brain but i'm not quite able to articulate them the way that i wanna
71-2_238.97_3.38.wav_ASR	generally i know right away when i made a mistake
71-2_243.091_1.339.wav_ASR	but sometimes i don't
71-2_244.631_2.0.wav_ASR	yes today i i said to someone
71-2_246.696_3.48.wav_ASR	well we got this collection coming up and january four
71-2_250.676_1.27.wav_ASR	and she said
71-2_253.536_0.404.wav_ASR	way for the
71-2_253.94_0.621.wav_ASR	it's apple
71-2_254.576_0.84.wav_ASR	and i said
71-2_255.492_0.747.wav_ASR	what did i say
71-2_256.376_0.528.wav_ASR	and she said
71-2_256.996_0.815.wav_ASR	you said january
71-2_258.98_1.021.wav_ASR	well it feels like jan
71-2_260.696_3.525.wav_ASR	again i try to just wing those and figure out away to get past it
71-2_264.41_8.22.wav_ASR	but i simply cannot trust that what will come out of my mouth is what i actually trying to say
71-2_273.01_14.82.wav_ASR	and i don't know how to fix that except just to keep trying to re install those language parts ways that have been disrupted and try to catch them fast i guess
71-2_295.73_2.62.wav_ASR	yes i remember exactly when i had a stroke
71-2_298.52_5.42.wav_ASR	had a stroke on january first twenty twenty one
71-2_320.33_14.302.wav_ASR	so i essentially had a fun trip headache to my right temple and did not know what it was for two days
71-2_335.13_1.573.wav_ASR	and then of course they admitted me
71-2_336.703_9.4.wav_ASR	but it was passed the window of opportunity to be able to give me some type of drugs that might have broken up the clot
71-2_347.563_2.227.wav_ASR	so i entered the hospital
71-2_350.403_1.92.wav_ASR	as soon as i would have another stroke
71-2_353.183_0.607.wav_ASR	have not
71-2_354.09_4.36.wav_ASR	and they have not been able to find the cause of the illness
71-2_359.72_1.67.wav_ASR	as soon as it was the perfect storm
71-2_362.04_12.44.wav_ASR	as soon as it might have been a conversation of working out really hard being stressed because of the pandemic and not being able to have christmas
71-2_374.76_2.765.wav_ASR	those were pretty magnificent days
71-2_378.52_3.0.wav_ASR	we were in a position then where it was pretty easy
71-2_381.743_3.632.wav_ASR	and and i don't know what else it could have been
71-2_385.583_5.67.wav_ASR	literally there's there's physically nothing wrong with my body
71-2_391.703_3.994.wav_ASR	and all of my numbers increase that i should not have a stroke
71-2_395.843_2.223.wav_ASR	and yes yeah i had a stroke
71-2_398.363_1.62.wav_ASR	so yeah anyway
71-2_400.181_2.92.wav_ASR	tripod tripod
71-2_403.981_4.263.wav_ASR	you you just move on with that i guess
71-2_408.721_0.379.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
71-2_418.32_17.68.wav_ASR	well as i said a week ago most of the recovery has been self instituted and has not been done through the direction of therapy or help from any medical professional
71-2_437.57_8.66.wav_ASR	and i think that that's kind of a tragedy in the sense that people have had
71-2_446.73_3.68.wav_ASR	it i was characterized as having a mild speech struggle
71-2_451.57_12.92.wav_ASR	we were in the position of the particular to come to completely recover if we were given the right interventions in the right kind of treatment within certain time frame
71-2_464.99_16.04.wav_ASR	so i think the first six months after stroke is really cruel and turns of rapid recovery because you're building on the spontaneous recovery recovery that that your brain is able to generate to bring back language
71-2_482.13_11.14.wav_ASR	really disappointed in the emergency help insurance industry the sense that i was not given what i should have gotten
71-2_493.53_18.08.wav_ASR	so what i've done on my own is really increase my the quantity of my diet which was already mediterranean Mediterranean style of of diet
71-2_511.89_1.417.wav_ASR	everybody agreed that it
71-2_513.307_1.654.wav_ASR	and i've been doing that for about ten years
71-2_515.327_10.103.wav_ASR	oh i gave up drinking completely though i don't really think that was in issue since i was drinking maybe one glass a month
71-2_525.43_10.02.wav_ASR	but but it must increase facility no improvement improvement
71-2_536.21_4.1.wav_ASR	it might increase inflammation in my body
71-2_540.325_10.3.wav_ASR	and that's something that i'm trying to work very strongly to make sure that i have an adequate implementation
71-2_551.465_1.7.wav_ASR	have enjoyed my exercise
71-2_553.585_1.6.wav_ASR	again i'm already
71-2_559.81_19.778.wav_ASR	so i've increased the cognitive the very conscious cognitive tests that i do every single day to make sure that my focus and concentration levels are relatively high
71-2_579.588_2.895.wav_ASR	oh again i was in accident
71-2_582.748_15.385.wav_ASR	so i have all the ways done a lot of reading every day trying to develop a lot of close work every day trying to develop and weve organizations together every single day but
71-2_598.133_2.617.wav_ASR	have done it much more conscious than in the past
71-2_601.85_7.16.wav_ASR	writing is always reliable in the sense that i have the operation of it
71-2_609.473_2.297.wav_ASR	and i do sometimes use the wrong word
71-2_612.753_2.617.wav_ASR	you you generally catch it when i add it in
71-2_615.79_3.34.wav_ASR	and i always hadta add it before the stroke too
71-2_619.37_9.39.wav_ASR	so i don't know to what extent those mistakes are connected to the stroke affect or whether that's just the way that i write
71-2_628.91_4.36.wav_ASR	you do a rough draft to get the ideas out
71-2_633.443_2.915.wav_ASR	and then you refine it the second time around
71-2_637.303_9.727.wav_ASR	so i i i think the only real difference from the way i live my life after this stroke then is making sure that i always get enough sleep
71-2_647.963_4.187.wav_ASR	before the stroke i tried to get sleep
71-2_652.45_7.12.wav_ASR	but i just poured on because i have a schedule that i hafta
71-2_660.87_8.901.wav_ASR	now it's it's a priority for me to the extent that i have ability to make sure that i speak as much as i can
71-2_670.05_5.06.wav_ASR	but outside then i just have a renovation every single day that i're always done
71-2_676.49_0.563.wav_ASR	they're really well
71-2_677.41_1.165.wav_ASR	exercise every day
71-2_679.05_2.72.wav_ASR	push my brain as much as i can
71-2_682.23_7.28.wav_ASR	and i made attempt to take back up a language skill
71-2_689.79_3.4.wav_ASR	it was taking space classes before the stroke
71-2_693.397_2.653.wav_ASR	and i took branch when i was in high school
71-2_696.33_3.6.wav_ASR	and i picked up a little bit of dance when i lived in kootenay
71-2_701.01_4.263.wav_ASR	but i thought spanish would be much more useful than french
71-2_706.37_2.1.wav_ASR	so i started taking a spanish class
71-2_708.69_4.73.wav_ASR	and i hadta disconnect it because it was late at night
71-2_713.57_1.99.wav_ASR	it just wasn't working out for me
71-2_716.7_10.19.wav_ASR	but from what i read recently i think one of the things that might be really helpful to rescue my english is to pick up some spanish
71-2_727.56_1.88.wav_ASR	it's i you know i don't know
71-2_729.6_1.14.wav_ASR	thought it might be confusing
71-2_731.12_2.971.wav_ASR	but why not try it you know
71-2_734.091_1.949.wav_ASR	why not yes what happens
71-2_736.54_3.066.wav_ASR	oh yeah that may be what i do next i think
71-2_739.76_1.333.wav_ASR	what i'm already doing
71-2_767.08_3.158.wav_ASR	let me see
71-2_771.54_4.68.wav_ASR	happy sad
71-2_779.25_0.7.wav_ASR	oh
71-2_782.83_5.9.wav_ASR	and i'm gonna talk about my reaction to what happened on nine eleven in two thousand and one
71-2_790.19_2.46.wav_ASR	three i was tired
71-2_793.11_3.98.wav_ASR	it was the beginning of a the spring semester in two thousand and nine
71-2_797.09_4.16.wav_ASR	and and my daughter had gone to school
71-2_803.03_9.82.wav_ASR	so as soon as she left at at about eighteen fifteen i got on the computer because i hadta finish my schooling
71-2_813.15_3.66.wav_ASR	yes i i i should have already finished my sentence
71-2_817.67_1.9.wav_ASR	and it was generally done
71-2_819.73_2.089.wav_ASR	but i was kinda playing with some of the end of it
71-2_822.23_5.923.wav_ASR	my eighth public class because i just wanted to just uplift a little bit
71-2_828.41_1.08.wav_ASR	so i wasn't alone
71-2_830.33_2.92.wav_ASR	obviously the rabia was not because i hadta concentrate
71-2_833.352_4.423.wav_ASR	or i certainly wasn't watching television when i was trying to do my work
71-2_837.872_12.614.wav_ASR	so i was in this zone of silence with no connection to the outside world just going through these different areas and deciding which one would fit best in terms of what i was trying to do
71-2_851.51_5.54.wav_ASR	and at two o'clock in the afternoon i was gonna take a break
71-2_857.21_3.32.wav_ASR	and i was gonna go to my gym and work out
71-2_861.07_1.14.wav_ASR	and it was a beautiful day
71-2_862.61_1.64.wav_ASR	was you know separate oh
71-2_868.85_0.8.wav_ASR	and i turned on the radio
71-2_870.87_3.98.wav_ASR	and the answer says
71-2_875.69_2.16.wav_ASR	and i don't really know what the school are gonna close
71-2_878.53_0.64.wav_ASR	and i kept saying
71-2_879.77_1.12.wav_ASR	the school's gonna close
71-2_881.09_0.48.wav_ASR	oh well
71-2_888.143_3.145.wav_ASR	and and i got to the the gym
71-2_892.33_2.473.wav_ASR	and they were television every
71-2_895.423_2.206.wav_ASR	they were in the deck when you come in
71-2_897.723_1.36.wav_ASR	and that never exercise
71-2_899.443_1.827.wav_ASR	everybody looked really really upset
71-2_901.963_1.96.wav_ASR	so i i'm walking in there saying
71-2_904.483_2.874.wav_ASR	things happened here that i don't know about
71-2_907.37_1.5.wav_ASR	but everybody else knows about it
71-2_909.35_2.12.wav_ASR	they're all staring at the screen
71-2_911.55_3.34.wav_ASR	so i went to the section where my treadmill
71-2_915.83_3.818.wav_ASR	and again the trees were not anywhere near as running along the tree
71-2_919.77_3.262.wav_ASR	but that's what i was gonna do that day because i hadta do some lifting
71-2_923.27_1.915.wav_ASR	and that's what i saw
71-2_925.185_12.8.wav_ASR	but at that point by two o'clock in the afternoon they were just replaying it over and over and over and over again
71-2_938.265_2.813.wav_ASR	and they were introducing people who were trying to get away
71-2_941.365_1.64.wav_ASR	everything is covered with ashes
71-2_944.49_6.22.wav_ASR	and i remember getting on the the treadmill and you know putting on my head phones and listening to music
71-2_951.07_7.56.wav_ASR	and i just kept going fast and fast and fast and faster because the adrenaline of what it happened was just so shock
71-2_959.41_3.86.wav_ASR	so i kinda use that you know to increase my work
71-2_963.53_2.82.wav_ASR	and i got out of there
71-2_966.61_1.02.wav_ASR	and i went home and said
71-2_967.91_0.384.wav_ASR	oh man
71-2_968.294_4.966.wav_ASR	you got a really close friend that lives in dc that works near the pentagon
71-2_973.35_2.086.wav_ASR	so he
71-2_975.69_0.829.wav_ASR	what's going on
71-2_977.21_0.94.wav_ASR	so i tried to call
71-2_978.45_3.78.wav_ASR	of course i couldn't get through because all the the sentences were were done
71-2_982.23_3.06.wav_ASR	one no one could get home and leave
71-2_985.57_1.836.wav_ASR	everything was shot down
71-2_988.71_2.16.wav_ASR	and i got on
71-2_991.09_0.94.wav_ASR	and i start eating
71-2_992.31_1.48.wav_ASR	then i emailed my department
71-2_993.97_1.78.wav_ASR	he was in the public safety department
71-2_995.93_0.34.wav_ASR	and
71-2_996.81_2.067.wav_ASR	we're gonna have a panel on campus
71-2_999.41_1.76.wav_ASR	we're gonna invite the committee
71-2_1001.32_2.481.wav_ASR	and we're going to explain what is going on
71-2_1004.36_5.934.wav_ASR	and we're gonna explain all of that
71-2_1010.3_3.871.wav_ASR	we're gonna explain the applications of it
71-2_1014.18_3.5.wav_ASR	we're gonna talk about the history of
71-2_1018.48_2.588.wav_ASR	we're gonna explain exactly what is going on here
71-2_1021.068_3.442.wav_ASR	and everybody got back to me and maybe
71-2_1024.788_2.32.wav_ASR	meanwhile everyone responded and said
71-2_1027.288_1.502.wav_ASR	and i'd be happy to talk about this
71-2_1029.048_5.302.wav_ASR	happy to talk about the sentences in a row that are going on continually
71-2_1034.35_7.22.wav_ASR	and maybe that's relieved to what's going on with the the the bomers that are
71-2_1041.762_18.784.wav_ASR	all we knew at that point that they were coming from the military and that they were attacking the nighttime states and the Pentagon and the world trade and the Pentagon and the world trade as symbols of impairment and the western college i guess
71-2_1060.546_2.0.wav_ASR	and and how it is that we're gonna word
71-2_1063.386_1.58.wav_ASR	they were employees with us
71-2_1066.026_2.694.wav_ASR	oh yeah it all came together really quick
71-2_1069.006_1.514.wav_ASR	we went to bed at one o'clock in the morning
71-2_1071.126_4.007.wav_ASR	finally got an email back from my friend in dc who was fine
71-2_1075.986_3.141.wav_ASR	and got up went to campus the next day
71-2_1079.127_3.12.wav_ASR	and all the the legs were just sprawled
71-2_1082.467_8.34.wav_ASR	and only we did this talk about what happened in every single class hour after hour after hour
71-2_1091.927_2.073.wav_ASR	oh that's that's a lot there
71-2_1094.327_0.6.wav_ASR	yeah
71-2_1095.507_3.195.wav_ASR	it was a great palace by the way
71-2_1098.702_2.177.wav_ASR	we had five hundred people
71-2_1101.002_4.48.wav_ASR	they're standing alone standing standing
71-2_1106.562_0.607.wav_ASR	my turn to say
71-2_1107.262_1.0.wav_ASR	he's standing
71-2_1108.642_3.021.wav_ASR	people hadta stand in the back
71-2_1111.942_1.56.wav_ASR	but i'm trying to say it's strange
71-2_1115.89_2.82.wav_ASR	oh these fears that i useta be able to say
71-2_1118.87_0.92.wav_ASR	my start to say that
71-2_1119.99_1.393.wav_ASR	and i forget what the air in the middle
71-2_1122.11_1.8.wav_ASR	standing room
71-2_1124.33_0.389.wav_ASR	yeah we
71-2_1124.719_2.671.wav_ASR	helped up the place basically and once in a while
71-2_1127.69_1.1.wav_ASR	and everybody's question
71-2_1129.59_0.76.wav_ASR	how do they hate us
71-2_1130.57_2.4.wav_ASR	and that's what we began with
71-2_1133.59_0.94.wav_ASR	oh
71-2_1136.424_12.445.wav_ASR	other than i missed the whole thing because of course i was on line writing a letter that i never gave because you know circumstances took over yeah where we were
71-2_1189.34_19.84.wav_ASR	well it seems to be taking place in a neighborhood which is relatively close to each other
71-2_1209.06_5.336.wav_ASR	and it looks like what's going on is a boy is in the back yard
71-2_1214.88_2.2.wav_ASR	and he's playing with his soccer
71-2_1217.52_1.92.wav_ASR	he's practicing his car
71-2_1220.38_11.126.wav_ASR	and unfortunately this time the ball doesn't not go where he hoped it would go and crashes into the window
71-2_1232.06_5.1.wav_ASR	and it looks like it might have been the window of his next door neighbor
71-2_1237.38_1.26.wav_ASR	it couldn't be his father
71-2_1238.86_0.86.wav_ASR	it's difficult to know
71-2_1239.78_7.2.wav_ASR	but it was a window that was next to the yard in which he was playing with his soccer ball
71-2_1247.88_3.96.wav_ASR	well it hit the the glass of the window and broke it
71-2_1252.48_4.08.wav_ASR	unfortunately there was a man sitting in the chair right next to the window
71-2_1257.78_7.66.wav_ASR	and the soccer ball not only broke the window but went through completely into the the house
71-2_1266.32_2.88.wav_ASR	oh apparently they have no skills from what i'm guessing
71-2_1269.48_2.687.wav_ASR	so it can be reconvened because we have mice mice here
71-2_1272.167_11.407.wav_ASR	the ball ended up in the house in the room directly where the man was sitting
71-2_1284.62_3.27.wav_ASR	and he was not pleased about this
71-2_1288.15_5.76.wav_ASR	he stood up and looked out the window to try to figure out who had broken the window
71-2_1294.2_1.43.wav_ASR	oh where did the ball come from
71-2_1295.93_9.0.wav_ASR	and who is the person who had decorated that ball torn his window
71-2_1305.71_7.06.wav_ASR	he's it's clearly that there's going to be some kind of ramifications as a result of this
71-2_1313.51_3.88.wav_ASR	because if it's his son his son is going to be school
71-2_1317.638_12.22.wav_ASR	and and if it's his neighbor he's gonna expect an application and probably some sort of permission to repair the the glass that's been broken
71-2_1331.61_2.368.wav_ASR	soroma in the summer
71-2_1351.36_23.18.wav_ASR	well we're gonna tell this story mother knows best which is a play on the fact that they apparently was a much older television show which was called father no
71-2_1374.637_1.24.wav_ASR	and it was very peaceful
71-2_1376.717_2.203.wav_ASR	you know the father leaves
71-2_1379.217_1.12.wav_ASR	mother is the horse
71-2_1380.877_2.16.wav_ASR	the father knows best
71-2_1383.339_19.92.wav_ASR	oh in any case this particular story is gonna be mother knows best which is probably significantly more contemporary in the sense that the mother's generally i would say as a general whole no better than their children
71-2_1403.327_4.073.wav_ASR	but in this particular case that's exactly what's happening
71-2_1407.4_17.237.wav_ASR	and and what's going on is this child and the child's mother is debating over whether this boy needs to take an umbrella with him when he leaves
71-2_1424.637_5.175.wav_ASR	and the mother is saying because she they're getting ready for the boy to go off on his own
71-2_1430.477_1.44.wav_ASR	and the mother is saying
71-2_1432.357_10.134.wav_ASR	up what we see with the clouds that are outside on the sky and what we see on the weather reports it looks like it's gonna rain
71-2_1442.577_1.295.wav_ASR	so i think you should take an umbrella
71-2_1443.872_2.02.wav_ASR	well and the little boy is going
71-2_1446.272_1.58.wav_ASR	he'm not taking an umbrella
71-2_1448.132_1.546.wav_ASR	three i don't need one
71-2_1450.032_1.204.wav_ASR	and i don't care if it rains
71-2_1451.572_0.969.wav_ASR	oh not getting married
71-2_1453.572_2.904.wav_ASR	my i'm fine on my own
71-2_1457.132_0.708.wav_ASR	so she said
71-2_1458.152_1.904.wav_ASR	well alright you know best
71-2_1460.812_1.116.wav_ASR	and she's goodbye to him
71-2_1462.212_0.403.wav_ASR	they were
71-2_1462.615_2.1.wav_ASR	he's still holding the umbrella
71-2_1465.335_0.768.wav_ASR	he hands out
71-2_1466.655_2.06.wav_ASR	and it's not just a sprinkle
71-2_1468.935_3.82.wav_ASR	but it really really starts to rain really hard
71-2_1472.915_1.22.wav_ASR	it's a downpour
71-2_1475.7_2.625.wav_ASR	and he's not happy
71-2_1478.655_2.945.wav_ASR	so the rain is getting inside
71-2_1481.94_2.26.wav_ASR	and he's getting really really really wet
71-2_1484.32_4.93.wav_ASR	his clothes are getting drenched and saturated with the water
71-2_1489.82_1.78.wav_ASR	so he gets about half a ball
71-2_1492.22_1.78.wav_ASR	and he can't even see what's going on
71-2_1494.3_3.58.wav_ASR	so he heads back to his mother very
71-2_1499.24_0.76.wav_ASR	he looks at her
71-2_1501.22_2.46.wav_ASR	and she has the grace not to say
71-2_1503.88_0.744.wav_ASR	and i told you so
71-2_1505.06_1.279.wav_ASR	because mother's no best
71-2_1506.48_1.32.wav_ASR	they knew what that word
71-2_1508.74_1.78.wav_ASR	and he stands her and looks at her
71-2_1510.86_1.98.wav_ASR	and she hands him the umbrella
71-2_1513.76_0.96.wav_ASR	he heads off again
71-2_1515.14_3.02.wav_ASR	three this time remembering in his brain
71-2_1519.26_3.04.wav_ASR	my mother's not always wrong about everything
71-2_1524.14_4.02.wav_ASR	but of course he forget it by the next week when something else comes up
71-2_1528.48_7.687.wav_ASR	where we are in this week he is now assured that his mother actually has wife which he does not have
71-2_1536.5_2.081.wav_ASR	oh i mother's son
71-2_1555.22_3.121.wav_ASR	well speaking of drama in the neighborhood
71-2_1559.54_8.9.wav_ASR	what had happened here became because the cat was sitting on the porch
71-2_1569.36_3.67.wav_ASR	the cat has the right to sit on the branch
71-2_1573.78_3.17.wav_ASR	but the next door neighbor has a dog
71-2_1576.95_6.958.wav_ASR	and the dog came out and immediately saw the cat and ran over and started barking at the cat
71-2_1584.11_1.22.wav_ASR	and the cat was spooked
71-2_1586.07_5.36.wav_ASR	the cat ran from the the dog and ran up the tree because that was close
71-2_1591.15_6.0.wav_ASR	and that was away to get away from the dog because the dog couldn't climb
71-2_1597.65_2.042.wav_ASR	so the cat climbed up the tree
71-2_1600.41_0.894.wav_ASR	just see young cat
71-2_1601.49_6.55.wav_ASR	it's a cat that just barely a kitten and isn't really unconscious to be that high up
71-2_1608.43_1.61.wav_ASR	so the cat crawled up
71-2_1610.78_6.66.wav_ASR	the little girl ran out saw her cat was up in the tree and called her father and said
71-2_1619.16_1.18.wav_ASR	cat is up in the tree
71-2_1621.04_3.96.wav_ASR	and she's out on the bar
71-2_1625.76_9.82.wav_ASR	and it doesn't look like she's finding her way to get back out because she's meowing very loudly and clearly wants to be rescued
71-2_1636.4_1.22.wav_ASR	so please help me
71-2_1638.16_2.86.wav_ASR	please help me get my cat out of the tree
71-2_1641.3_3.6.wav_ASR	the father's trying to be helpful and the kid
71-2_1645.16_4.36.wav_ASR	so he immediately goes into the garden and finds his ladder
71-2_1650.2_21.487.wav_ASR	and the plan for him was he would simply be able to climb up the the ladder get to the tree inch his way up to the limb where the cat was grabbed it probably put it inside his shirt fall down and handed it to his daughter
71-2_1671.68_2.39.wav_ASR	and then he could be you know the hurry
71-2_1674.76_5.62.wav_ASR	he could fulfill his daughters' quest
71-2_1681.42_2.26.wav_ASR	unfortunately he got up in the tree
71-2_1684.54_10.49.wav_ASR	and the he hadn't securely rested the ladder against the tree he really needed
71-2_1695.33_1.1.wav_ASR	and it's all done
71-2_1697.33_4.1.wav_ASR	so now we have two people that hafta be rescued from the tree
71-2_1701.65_7.1.wav_ASR	we have the cat that's still meowing loudly out in the far
71-2_1709.29_12.14.wav_ASR	and of course the father can't reach it because he's his weight is too heavy to be able to move into those limbs without breaking them down
71-2_1721.65_1.78.wav_ASR	and then he would fall down and get hurt
71-2_1724.19_6.76.wav_ASR	so at this point the mother who knows best has called the fire department and said
71-2_1731.81_2.587.wav_ASR	he got a slipper fitting going on here
71-2_1734.59_1.211.wav_ASR	oh that is what she said
71-2_1735.801_6.58.wav_ASR	but that's what she thought in her brain because she doesn't say the words in front of her because she doesn't want them to know about her family
71-2_1742.881_2.24.wav_ASR	can you please bring
71-2_1745.553_16.023.wav_ASR	unfortunately we now need help from fire firefighters to not only get the cat out of the tree but my husband climb climb up to help rescue the the cat
71-2_1761.576_6.523.wav_ASR	and my daughter is still singing because she's worried about the cat
71-2_1768.376_1.494.wav_ASR	and now she's worried about her dad
71-2_1770.876_2.274.wav_ASR	and the dog is still barking
71-2_1773.756_3.1.wav_ASR	what that she's doing is she's about ready
71-2_1777.576_1.228.wav_ASR	is the fire firefighters are here
71-2_1779.076_1.061.wav_ASR	they're coming over
71-2_1780.05_2.35.wav_ASR	and they're going to help the man get down first
71-2_1782.71_3.09.wav_ASR	and they're going to reach out and get the cat
71-2_1786.3_8.752.wav_ASR	and what the mother's gonna do is she's gonna go and grab the dog and put him in the other room so that everybody will relax a bit
71-2_1796.11_3.213.wav_ASR	everybody can make it out of the tree without getting hurt
71-2_1799.323_1.586.wav_ASR	the end
71-2_2004.09_16.38.wav_ASR	and what we're essentially looking for here is economic mobility and social mobility and what the criteria are that woman hafta assess in order to improve their situation in society
71-2_2021.77_1.86.wav_ASR	so we're gonna start with that
71-2_2023.99_13.24.wav_ASR	and this is an example of the very restrictive rules that were applicable to women in certain circumstances and certain society
71-2_2038.46_5.74.wav_ASR	oh no what we're seeing here are family which is relatively middle class
71-2_2045.26_10.16.wav_ASR	and the in both cases what we had were two families with children
71-2_2056.56_3.02.wav_ASR	and each of them had a spouse that died
71-2_2061.01_13.758.wav_ASR	the husband had one daughter who was living with him
71-2_2075.16_1.256.wav_ASR	but his wife had died
71-2_2076.416_3.656.wav_ASR	but so he had a a young daughter who was about six years old
71-2_2080.296_11.24.wav_ASR	again in university psychology we'll say nineteen seventy men could not raise their own children
71-2_2091.936_1.731.wav_ASR	they hadta have a woman
71-2_2093.856_0.741.wav_ASR	it was her rule
71-2_2094.68_3.78.wav_ASR	people were relatively ridged in terms of what they were allowed to do
71-2_2099.12_3.78.wav_ASR	so he hadta find a wife in order to care for his daughter
71-2_2103.96_13.22.wav_ASR	one in another part of town relative same social status we have a man and and wife who had two children
71-2_2118.02_0.76.wav_ASR	and he
71-2_2119.64_8.66.wav_ASR	so the only way that she would be to survive as a female is to find another man that would marry her
71-2_2129.4_2.86.wav_ASR	so they're both out looking for another
71-2_2133.36_1.3.wav_ASR	and they meet each other
71-2_2135.0_28.16.wav_ASR	and of course what the husband is looking for is someone that will take care of his wife's looking for is someone that will take care of his wife as a mother and you know will do all the other things that woman is supposed to do and then men don't do because we have very restricted very different different engagement scheduled rolls that they operate in this city
71-2_2164.74_1.14.wav_ASR	so they meet each other
71-2_2166.5_3.74.wav_ASR	and he's gotten the expression that she's gonna be a wonderful wife
71-2_2170.64_3.8.wav_ASR	he suddenly gushes all over his daughter
71-2_2175.66_1.62.wav_ASR	and so they they marry
71-2_2177.28_12.12.wav_ASR	there are now three children two daughters from her original family his daughter named cinderella from his family
71-2_2189.86_2.76.wav_ASR	and they've now blended into this new society
71-2_2193.69_11.26.wav_ASR	the father then follows his rule which is go out and make money for the family and leaves the house under the management of the stepmother
71-2_2205.31_21.673.wav_ASR	the stepmother on the other hand has not fulfilled her promise to mother the stepdaughter but instead has decided that she's going to favor her daughters and is going to treat the other stepdaughters her birth daughters and is going to treat the other stepdaughters as if she's a maid
71-2_2227.87_6.94.wav_ASR	and for whatever reason the father does not interfere in what he sees when he is home
71-2_2235.41_10.02.wav_ASR	and so what we have is this this really terrible situation that exists for cinderella
71-2_2245.527_4.893.wav_ASR	the cinderella had beautiful mother who loved her
71-2_2250.667_1.201.wav_ASR	he was close to her father
71-2_2252.027_0.76.wav_ASR	he lost her
71-2_2253.147_9.1.wav_ASR	now she's also in the situation where she's clearly treated differently than her stepdaughters stepsisters
71-2_2262.887_2.555.wav_ASR	smashy party fairy slipper
71-2_2265.442_1.074.wav_ASR	it happens all the time
71-2_2267.022_0.954.wav_ASR	anyway moving on
71-2_2269.122_1.278.wav_ASR	they live happily ever after
71-2_2270.462_8.32.wav_ASR	there's no way that woman can improve their their position in this society except through marriage
71-2_2279.762_2.46.wav_ASR	it's the only possible option to them
71-2_2282.222_18.073.wav_ASR	and so they're probably roll going up is to learn how to manage a house and also be attractive to the hedon hedon hedon section partners that are available to them
71-2_2300.295_2.36.wav_ASR	and i don't know what happens if they're not healthy
71-2_2303.295_2.211.wav_ASR	oh i i guess they just fake it
71-2_2305.815_2.972.wav_ASR	in any case that's not part of this particular story
71-2_2309.455_1.22.wav_ASR	and she's drenched
71-2_2310.915_3.032.wav_ASR	and so that's one conversation she doesn't hafta do with him
71-2_2313.947_8.6.wav_ASR	in any case on the other side of the city at a fire flash is
71-2_2323.465_20.82.wav_ASR	and again while the prince has essentially a lot of economic power and he's at the top of his corporate and social status he's also opposed to marry
71-2_2344.363_9.7.wav_ASR	because the plan is that he will marry a wife and that wife will then bear him children
71-2_2354.443_6.44.wav_ASR	and those children then means that they will be a limit on to the next generation
71-2_2361.383_1.861.wav_ASR	so he may not wanna get married
71-2_2363.24_6.92.wav_ASR	and we don't really know what his geography identity is or origin
71-2_2370.56_2.72.wav_ASR	but he's he understands what his job is
71-2_2373.42_1.38.wav_ASR	he hasta find a woman
71-2_2375.14_1.42.wav_ASR	he hasta find a part
71-2_2377.46_11.7.wav_ASR	and his plan is to find someone who's relatively attractive while he fills the the operations of his office in the restricted section which they excuse me
71-2_2389.76_4.76.wav_ASR	so the plan is he's gonna get this over with quickly
71-2_2394.609_4.6.wav_ASR	they're gonna have this huge dance this huge ball
71-2_2400.449_1.88.wav_ASR	every one in the kingdom
71-2_2403.749_2.623.wav_ASR	my i'm assuming we're pretty much middle class above
71-2_2406.669_3.7.wav_ASR	he's not really going to the party crash
71-2_2410.569_1.731.wav_ASR	it's not part of this ball
71-2_2413.36_14.64.wav_ASR	is involved all of the eligible females who would like to be married to come and obtain for him so that he can walk through and make his
71-2_2429.0_1.96.wav_ASR	again this is clearly
71-2_2432.56_5.54.wav_ASR	so almost like that bachelor show which i've never seen and never would see
71-2_2438.84_2.588.wav_ASR	but i certainly know a way of life
71-2_2441.428_16.26.wav_ASR	that that woman are gonna be tested and graded and chosen out of a a line of other women to be able to be tested and graded and chosen out of a a line of other women to be able to be tested and graded and chosen out of a a line of women
71-2_2458.96_11.18.wav_ASR	so anyway all three of these women the two stepsisters and cinderella all know that they are eligible
71-2_2470.64_6.62.wav_ASR	and they all start thinking about how wonderful their the situation would be if they get
71-2_2477.759_2.965.wav_ASR	and again what's interesting is we're not talking about love
71-2_2480.919_2.54.wav_ASR	or not talking about you know
71-2_2485.819_3.132.wav_ASR	we're not talking about people that are complicated with each other
71-2_2489.099_5.541.wav_ASR	we're talking about they will somehow be attractive enough for this male to choose them
71-2_2495.14_6.668.wav_ASR	and then their life situation will improve because those of the only the only operations they're able to
71-2_2502.2_11.34.wav_ASR	it's a very restrictive society in a certain time and in college which is very very limiting for female personnel
71-2_2514.72_1.813.wav_ASR	so they're they're all getting ready
71-2_2516.76_1.25.wav_ASR	and they know what they hafta do
71-2_2518.04_0.98.wav_ASR	they have a look at the truck
71-2_2519.46_1.52.wav_ASR	so they hafta have a really nice dress
71-2_2521.32_1.34.wav_ASR	here it is to be fixed up
71-2_2522.8_14.67.wav_ASR	but they hafta somehow make them stand out from the others and order to be chosen in this contest that they're gonna be entered into
71-2_2538.05_7.3.wav_ASR	so because the stepmother favors her own daughters she pulls out whatever money they have available
71-2_2545.61_13.82.wav_ASR	and she gets them the the the fancy dresses that you could possibly choose and you know with the hair dress and to get them as glossy up as possible
71-2_2560.48_2.99.wav_ASR	and cinderella pretty much knows that she's on her own
71-2_2563.97_8.22.wav_ASR	so she pulls out a book that she got from her mother which has patterns of dresses
71-2_2572.57_8.51.wav_ASR	because she's very smart and very creative and because she's hadta do a lot of the manual work in the house she knows how to sew
71-2_2581.9_5.18.wav_ASR	so she pulls together some scraps of material that are available to her
71-2_2587.26_3.6.wav_ASR	and she puts together this pretty cool dress really
71-2_2591.12_1.64.wav_ASR	me and it's kinda off the shore
71-2_2593.16_3.109.wav_ASR	yeah it's kinda pink which kinda plays off her hair
71-2_2597.18_1.602.wav_ASR	and she's ready to go
71-2_2599.24_1.68.wav_ASR	he's doing the best that he can
71-2_2600.92_1.16.wav_ASR	and that's what she is able
71-2_2602.7_0.86.wav_ASR	and she's ready
71-2_2603.98_2.02.wav_ASR	and of course her mother says
71-2_2606.3_1.06.wav_ASR	they're no science
71-2_2609.46_2.94.wav_ASR	you are not of our stock
71-2_2612.88_1.4.wav_ASR	you are a princess
71-2_2615.14_2.22.wav_ASR	you you don't have the right clothes for it
71-2_2617.64_1.2.wav_ASR	you're dressed correctly
71-2_2619.54_0.74.wav_ASR	you are not gonna
71-2_2620.5_1.42.wav_ASR	my daughters are going to
71-2_2622.98_4.02.wav_ASR	and they the stepsisters of course have gotten their cup from their mother
71-2_2627.22_1.94.wav_ASR	they know to be really really cool to her
71-2_2629.38_1.02.wav_ASR	so they laugh at her
71-2_2631.4_4.92.wav_ASR	and she goes out the barn to take care of the animals because that's kind of her responsibility
71-2_2636.32_4.32.wav_ASR	that's the place where she can go and get some kind of effect from the other woman
71-2_2641.04_0.764.wav_ASR	and she's out there
71-2_2642.1_1.3.wav_ASR	you know she's
71-2_2644.4_2.137.wav_ASR	and she's wearing her dress and her
71-2_2647.06_1.593.wav_ASR	you know she doesn't know what she's gonna do
71-2_2648.78_0.6.wav_ASR	what is she
71-2_2649.62_7.806.wav_ASR	what can she possibly do to somehow get out of the military situation that she's in
71-2_2657.46_8.42.wav_ASR	and and this fairy godmother appears to her because she's you know a wonderful person
71-2_2666.1_1.27.wav_ASR	he's giving to other people
71-2_2667.6_1.24.wav_ASR	and she deserves it
71-2_2669.7_4.22.wav_ASR	so this fairy godmother shows up and says
71-2_2674.82_0.58.wav_ASR	are you cool
71-2_2675.52_0.52.wav_ASR	what's wrong
71-2_2676.1_0.7.wav_ASR	what do you mean
71-2_2677.62_0.66.wav_ASR	and she said
71-2_2678.52_2.04.wav_ASR	and i would like to go to the the ball
71-2_2680.9_1.26.wav_ASR	but i want to wear

71-2_2707.42_0.56.wav_ASR	he looks at her
71-2_2708.52_7.98.wav_ASR	and she transforms the rats into horses that will be pulling a carriage
71-2_2716.86_3.12.wav_ASR	and the carriage is transformed from a pumpkin
71-2_2721.2_4.98.wav_ASR	and she uses her wand and and goes over cinderella's cloak

71-2_2808.012_1.558.wav_ASR	please enjoy your moment
71-2_2810.63_3.14.wav_ASR	so she hugs the fairy godmother
71-2_2814.41_1.88.wav_ASR	and she gets in the coach
71-2_2817.21_2.2.wav_ASR	he's taken to the
71-2_2820.33_0.36.wav_ASR	yes
71-2_2821.17_8.52.wav_ASR	even her stepsisters don't know who this woman is because she's dressed so magnificent that she stands out
71-2_2830.55_10.16.wav_ASR	all the other people that they're watching all they can think of is she must be from a really rich
71-2_2842.35_1.34.wav_ASR	and we don't know of her
71-2_2843.97_3.16.wav_ASR	but she must be from a very high social status
71-2_2847.65_1.71.wav_ASR	and she's clearly very beautiful
71-2_2849.56_5.5.wav_ASR	five i mean the fact that they don't even recognize their own stepsister is pretty telling
71-2_2855.87_1.702.wav_ASR	and in any case she walks in
71-2_2858.34_8.7.wav_ASR	the prince immediately in his outfit form sees her and said
71-2_2867.361_0.856.wav_ASR	he's the stand up
71-2_2868.82_1.51.wav_ASR	he's the one
71-2_2870.72_1.77.wav_ASR	and he hits over to the word
71-2_2872.76_1.61.wav_ASR	and he immediately looks at her
71-2_2874.58_5.47.wav_ASR	he sees that she's all so beautiful on top of being clearly wealthy and wealth
71-2_2880.91_1.45.wav_ASR	he's all so great
71-2_2882.78_0.91.wav_ASR	he's a wonderful dance
71-2_2884.34_0.31.wav_ASR	firetruck
71-2_2885.36_1.74.wav_ASR	there's some awful
71-2_2887.88_2.89.wav_ASR	and there's there's committee between
71-2_2891.62_0.875.wav_ASR	and he said
71-2_2893.18_1.008.wav_ASR	he's thinking his mind
71-2_2894.42_1.321.wav_ASR	ahhah i thought this was gonna be awful
71-2_2896.04_2.52.wav_ASR	and i thought this was gonna be a dirty dirty
71-2_2898.78_2.795.wav_ASR	but i really like her
71-2_2902.0_1.34.wav_ASR	oh this is
71-2_2903.86_2.26.wav_ASR	he was hoping for something this much
71-2_2906.281_1.956.wav_ASR	three i was prepared for something else
71-2_2908.461_1.931.wav_ASR	but this just couldn't work
71-2_2910.761_2.955.wav_ASR	so he wants to spend time with her as much as he can
71-2_2913.941_0.479.wav_ASR	oh well
71-2_2914.681_0.98.wav_ASR	he's entering it too
71-2_2915.801_1.52.wav_ASR	me and they're really connected
71-2_2917.761_1.52.wav_ASR	it's just this wonderful bike
71-2_2920.001_4.289.wav_ASR	and then she looks up at the clock and sees that it's five minutes to midnight
71-2_2926.49_28.8.wav_ASR	and she knows because of this paper article that she lives in as soon as he sees what she really looks like how she's really dressed that she's really not this wealthy noble princess but is just a lower middle class female in his kingdom who's wearing
71-2_2956.938_4.418.wav_ASR	he she knows that that audience will also be gone
71-2_2961.538_9.22.wav_ASR	he she's pretty sure that what he really wanted is the the the trapping the animals all the stuff that goes along with wealth
71-2_2971.438_5.015.wav_ASR	so she knows that's as soon as he sees who she really is it's gonna be over
71-2_2976.453_4.78.wav_ASR	so she races away as quickly as she can because she wants to get away
71-2_2981.093_8.34.wav_ASR	he doesn't wanna see the look in his eye when he sees who she really is and what her real dress is and how she's really dressed
71-2_2990.23_2.14.wav_ASR	so he's he doesn't understand what happened
71-2_2992.653_0.437.wav_ASR	here she goes
71-2_2993.173_0.717.wav_ASR	what did he say
71-2_2994.053_1.277.wav_ASR	did he say something to aphasia
71-2_2995.46_1.51.wav_ASR	they're where she's having
71-2_2997.36_6.02.wav_ASR	and she races away as quickly as she can so quickly that she trips on her shoe
71-2_3003.6_0.62.wav_ASR	and she tripped
71-2_3004.74_1.712.wav_ASR	her shoe falls off
71-2_3006.6_1.342.wav_ASR	but she doesn't have time to grab him
71-2_3008.32_0.93.wav_ASR	he's gotta get gone
71-2_3009.56_0.89.wav_ASR	he's gonna get away
71-2_3010.96_1.49.wav_ASR	so she makes it around the corner
71-2_3012.45_3.64.wav_ASR	and immediately it happens
71-2_3016.65_9.027.wav_ASR	the the ball dress is transformed back into her ragged clothes
71-2_3025.677_7.746.wav_ASR	the pumpkin luckily she didn't get in it because i don't know what would have happened if she were actually inside the pumpkin
71-2_3033.917_1.461.wav_ASR	it's gone
71-2_3035.637_0.493.wav_ASR	slap it together
71-2_3036.697_2.343.wav_ASR	and the horses are gone
71-2_3039.7_1.22.wav_ASR	they're rats again
71-2_3041.9_5.82.wav_ASR	so she walks home sneaks in the back because you know they don't really care what she's doing
71-2_3047.96_2.44.wav_ASR	and she could be out in the the barn or whatever
71-2_3051.18_1.98.wav_ASR	and she remembers her mom
71-2_3053.64_0.44.wav_ASR	so
71-2_3054.52_2.96.wav_ASR	hey i got to see what it was like to be on the other side of it
71-2_3058.28_1.562.wav_ASR	oh maybe i can be content
71-2_3059.842_2.694.wav_ASR	or maybe there's some other way that i can get out of here
71-2_3062.542_1.178.wav_ASR	at least i had
71-2_3064.362_9.62.wav_ASR	least i know that if i had the appropriate clothes i could walk into a city at that level and i could
71-2_3075.322_2.431.wav_ASR	main time he's back in the palace
71-2_3078.142_1.402.wav_ASR	he's chasing after her
71-2_3079.8_11.914.wav_ASR	the point it's you know kind of the the cycle of of what's going on in his brain is got all these women throwing themselves at him that all and this one is playing hard to get because she left
71-2_3092.42_1.26.wav_ASR	so there's kind of a mystery there
71-2_3093.8_0.92.wav_ASR	he's got the shoe
71-2_3095.48_0.44.wav_ASR	and he said
71-2_3096.62_2.419.wav_ASR	oh i want that woman
71-2_3099.039_1.554.wav_ASR	and he says that to his father
71-2_3101.459_0.874.wav_ASR	oh i will get married
71-2_3102.659_1.457.wav_ASR	oh do everything you want me to do
71-2_3104.319_1.26.wav_ASR	feel my organization
71-2_3106.019_2.317.wav_ASR	but i'm only gonna marry a woman i wanna be with
71-2_3108.479_1.188.wav_ASR	and i decided who it is
71-2_3109.899_0.481.wav_ASR	it's her
71-2_3110.579_0.492.wav_ASR	the prince
71-2_3111.559_1.82.wav_ASR	the mystery woman
71-2_3113.739_1.359.wav_ASR	and i've got her shoe
71-2_3115.098_9.104.wav_ASR	so all i hafta do now is go around and see if i can figure out who's foot will fit into that shoe
71-2_3124.478_2.226.wav_ASR	and then that will be the person
71-2_3126.704_14.559.wav_ASR	because he's beginning to understand in his mind that there are some limitations of the society which is that they are human beings that transcend their social status and how much money they make
71-2_3141.263_17.44.wav_ASR	and he's beginning to think if the their souls could just be soul soulmates that would be something that they could exist reincarnation of what they're initial purpose in society was
71-2_3158.75_4.86.wav_ASR	so he's thinking much more broadly than his father is
71-2_3163.91_2.82.wav_ASR	and so they got this this this bar
71-2_3167.87_7.62.wav_ASR	if he can find a woman who's feet fit into those glass slippers he will know who that person is
71-2_3175.61_0.918.wav_ASR	and then he look at her
71-2_3176.528_4.36.wav_ASR	and he'll be able to know that that's the person that is true
71-2_3181.928_1.599.wav_ASR	and that's the person that he will win
71-2_3184.23_8.169.wav_ASR	and because the way city works is if you're rich you can marry down but but it hasta be their choice
71-2_3192.59_7.512.wav_ASR	if you're poor and you wanna marry up you're gonna be vague as some kind of social climate
71-2_3200.21_5.812.wav_ASR	so you pretty much need someone to reach down in some way
71-2_3207.09_0.38.wav_ASR	oh
71-2_3208.27_0.924.wav_ASR	he's married
71-2_3209.37_0.56.wav_ASR	slap it together
71-2_3210.23_5.02.wav_ASR	and give the patient limits of them she doesn't get to ask him
71-2_3215.67_1.58.wav_ASR	he hasta ask her
71-2_3217.53_2.64.wav_ASR	and this is this goes back two hundred years
71-2_3220.23_10.62.wav_ASR	and this is the way in which europe organized their society to their department in terms of what people could actually do
71-2_3232.95_1.66.wav_ASR	so he's going around
71-2_3234.63_9.058.wav_ASR	and of course this is clearly really interesting way to find the party that he's exactly looking for the mystery woman who got away
71-2_3244.37_1.53.wav_ASR	but he's no else what to do
71-2_3246.27_1.395.wav_ASR	and he's arrives arrives
71-2_3248.05_0.952.wav_ASR	he's the one i want
71-2_3249.19_4.215.wav_ASR	who saw the woman you know with the the great carriage
71-2_3253.405_1.7.wav_ASR	and he's called this doctor
71-2_3255.445_1.264.wav_ASR	everybody's looking for her
71-2_3256.825_0.684.wav_ASR	they can't find her
71-2_3258.025_3.705.wav_ASR	so we're gonna start with the the shoe because he's got something in front of him
71-2_3262.625_10.345.wav_ASR	and they arrive that he will be going city city city seeing if he can find the woman would come forward to see if he can find the woman that will fit the shoe
71-2_3273.59_2.54.wav_ASR	so of course the stepdaughters
71-2_3276.77_4.492.wav_ASR	he he passes this by the night of the ball
71-2_3281.67_5.34.wav_ASR	but all we gotta do at this point is get our feet to fit into that shoe
71-2_3287.15_7.66.wav_ASR	and of course they're looking at this and really super physical kind of way because he knows that as soon as he finds the right woman
71-2_3298.01_6.16.wav_ASR	and clearly even if those shoes did fit the stepdaughters it wouldn't match
71-2_3304.47_1.08.wav_ASR	they're be no
71-2_3305.92_1.24.wav_ASR	they're be no cats
71-2_3307.5_1.43.wav_ASR	but you know they don't understand that
71-2_3309.14_4.5.wav_ASR	they're really behind in terms of understanding human relationships
71-2_3314.91_9.46.wav_ASR	and cinderella is she knows if she has the opportunity to connect with him again he can take her out of the situation that she's in
71-2_3324.63_1.94.wav_ASR	and they did connect
71-2_3326.99_0.66.wav_ASR	they shouldn't
71-2_3327.87_0.666.wav_ASR	but they did
71-2_3328.77_1.6.wav_ASR	it was very important
71-2_3331.15_16.88.wav_ASR	but for whatever reason because of the fairy godmother she's been given that opportunity to step out of her role and move into a the princess
71-2_3349.85_4.94.wav_ASR	so when they come up to the house both of the stepsisters go
71-2_3355.33_3.9.wav_ASR	may try very hard to see if their feet will fit into the shoe
71-2_3359.65_1.118.wav_ASR	and they they don't
71-2_3361.07_2.251.wav_ASR	they're doing everything that he can
71-2_3363.39_2.46.wav_ASR	and this point the prince is just very disappointed
71-2_3366.67_1.663.wav_ASR	he doesn't think he's ever gonna find her again
71-2_3368.45_4.78.wav_ASR	and he'll be stuck with somebody else that his father will probably arrange for him
71-2_3374.21_1.02.wav_ASR	and he finally said
71-2_3375.45_9.07.wav_ASR	there's another woman in this house who could possibly be eligible for this
71-2_3385.34_2.26.wav_ASR	and cinderella stepsisters
71-2_3388.1_5.46.wav_ASR	and this is the basic thing she's ever done because her stepmother's just gonna punish her for this after
71-2_3394.22_0.66.wav_ASR	and she said
71-2_3395.354_0.61.wav_ASR	five i'm here
71-2_3396.64_1.68.wav_ASR	and the stepmother turns and looks at her
71-2_3398.32_11.3.wav_ASR	and she's ready to you know clearly to pursue her and and provide her not to eat for awhile and really make her life miserable
71-2_3410.66_4.26.wav_ASR	but the person that's working with the prince said
71-2_3415.8_1.04.wav_ASR	he said everybody
71-2_3417.006_1.52.wav_ASR	come on
71-2_3419.206_5.75.wav_ASR	and she steps forward decide the fact she's being glare at by the family members
71-2_3426.49_1.26.wav_ASR	and she sits down
71-2_3428.266_4.56.wav_ASR	and her foot fits the shoe
71-2_3433.786_1.224.wav_ASR	the prince looks at her
71-2_3435.486_0.884.wav_ASR	they're eyes meet
71-2_3437.19_5.92.wav_ASR	and once again he knows he's he's met his
71-2_3444.51_11.84.wav_ASR	and at that point all of the power that the prince has to be able to protect her from her stepmother is kind of enforced
71-2_3457.31_6.494.wav_ASR	all of her beautiful clothes come back though we're beginning to think this might have been an illusion in the first place
71-2_3465.03_1.22.wav_ASR	the stepmother says
71-2_3467.17_0.966.wav_ASR	he's out of my hands
71-2_3468.27_3.048.wav_ASR	but i had no ability to communicate with anyone more
71-2_3471.91_15.74.wav_ASR	and the prince pulls her out of there and brings her back to the palace where she will be groomed to be a much higher status than she has been living
71-2_3488.11_2.18.wav_ASR	and she's gonna hafta learn how to math
71-2_3490.38_2.51.wav_ASR	her she's gonna learn how to talk better
71-2_3493.22_6.463.wav_ASR	but she's gonna have to learn how to conduct herself as a lady
71-2_3500.06_5.22.wav_ASR	all the things that are associated associated with a higher social class
71-2_3505.28_7.11.wav_ASR	but because they connected at a human level this is gonna work
71-2_3569.68_4.16.wav_ASR	was just thinking about telling you last week
71-2_3574.16_1.744.wav_ASR	so i hafta come up with the new one and that
71-2_3575.904_16.746.wav_ASR	when i was in the third grade which means i was about eight i was very good with being able to read a club
71-2_3594.17_4.66.wav_ASR	but there were some details that i was not completely clear about
71-2_3599.49_5.1.wav_ASR	one of those is what is a quarter after on a clock
71-2_3606.01_7.8.wav_ASR	meanwhile i certainly knew that the shorter hand or hand was the hour
71-2_3614.27_3.18.wav_ASR	and the long hand was the minute
71-2_3618.41_10.9.wav_ASR	but from my professional in my eight year old when someone said twenty five after or quarter after it went twenty five after
71-2_3629.95_0.94.wav_ASR	didn't mean fifteen
71-2_3632.237_7.116.wav_ASR	and what had happened as my older sister was had stayed home sick that day
71-2_3640.43_4.54.wav_ASR	and i was sposta go to her elementary school teacher
71-2_3645.277_2.053.wav_ASR	and she was in the fifth grade
71-2_3647.95_6.86.wav_ASR	and i was sposta get her homework homework and bring it home to her so that she could do a work and she could return it the next day
71-2_3655.69_1.8.wav_ASR	and so i went to my teacher and said
71-2_3657.81_4.4.wav_ASR	and i'm sposta go to missus feaster
71-2_3662.55_3.64.wav_ASR	and i'm sposta pick up my sisters' home
71-2_3667.09_0.66.wav_ASR	and she said
71-2_3668.13_1.372.wav_ASR	why didn't you go at quarter after
71-2_3669.502_1.648.wav_ASR	so i said
71-2_3671.37_0.632.wav_ASR	yeah i will
71-2_3672.79_7.687.wav_ASR	my thought quarter after was twenty five minutes after because in my mind that's what made sense
71-2_3680.63_1.36.wav_ASR	the quarter's twenty five minutes
71-2_3682.55_2.16.wav_ASR	the quarter's worth twenty five cents
71-2_3685.29_6.464.wav_ASR	so quarter after would be three twenty five not three fifteen which is what she's saying
71-2_3691.83_1.241.wav_ASR	quarter after the hour
71-2_3693.83_6.8.wav_ASR	so i waited until three twenty five which is five minutes before the school is is closed
71-2_3701.57_3.218.wav_ASR	it's way too late for me to be going and doing what i'm supposed to be doing
71-2_3704.71_1.76.wav_ASR	and i was sposta have done it ten minutes earlier
71-2_3706.77_5.92.wav_ASR	and i'm watching the clock until exactly three twenty five and getting up and going to do what i'm sposta do
71-2_3713.17_1.54.wav_ASR	and i ran home
71-2_3715.13_4.3.wav_ASR	of course it's a mess because i'm missing the end of my class
71-2_3720.41_4.7.wav_ASR	her class is closing down
71-2_3726.15_4.02.wav_ASR	so i get back to my class probably at three thirty five
71-2_3730.99_3.236.wav_ASR	my teacher is still waiting there because my stuff is still in the dust
71-2_3734.91_1.24.wav_ASR	did you wait so long
71-2_3736.33_0.6.wav_ASR	and she said
71-2_3737.07_2.17.wav_ASR	exactly when you told me to go
71-2_3739.78_1.66.wav_ASR	you told me to go at four o'clock
71-2_3742.38_0.58.wav_ASR	and she said
71-2_3743.24_2.52.wav_ASR	oh no you didn't go until three twenty five
71-2_3746.02_0.42.wav_ASR	and i said
71-2_3746.78_1.46.wav_ASR	but isn't that correct
71-2_3749.18_19.93.wav_ASR	and so at the age of eight i understood finally that when adult say quarter after and their gesturing or referring to a clock that they mean fifteen minutes after an hour and not twenty five minutes after an hour
71-2_3769.95_0.381.wav_ASR	oh
71-2_3770.47_0.576.wav_ASR	yes i don't know
71-2_3783.83_0.927.wav_ASR	well to me
71-2_3784.77_0.667.wav_ASR	it was easy
71-2_3785.65_0.876.wav_ASR	excuse me
71-2_3786.87_2.118.wav_ASR	you know quarter after the hour
71-2_3788.988_1.9.wav_ASR	oh boy oh boy oh boy
71-2_3791.248_1.687.wav_ASR	they just weren't clear about it
71-2_3793.668_2.282.wav_ASR	now that i actually talk back
71-2_3796.328_1.262.wav_ASR	me i was in a conference
71-2_3797.748_1.362.wav_ASR	you're never talk back to anybody
71-2_3799.368_1.8.wav_ASR	but i i was just really confused
71-2_3809.35_6.62.wav_ASR	you think of a good word
71-2_3816.149_18.351.wav_ASR	to talk about this story i think i'm going to talk about when i learned how to write a turkey because at the time when i did it i was asked if i could bake the bird
71-2_3836.08_11.38.wav_ASR	and of course growing up in an extended family and which we had very very huge thanksgiving dinner by my own
71-2_3847.78_2.32.wav_ASR	generally we would go to my grandmother's house
71-2_3850.98_1.12.wav_ASR	and she had eleven children
71-2_3852.94_2.427.wav_ASR	so our job
71-2_3855.367_3.059.wav_ASR	my father was the second oldest of that family
71-2_3859.04_2.22.wav_ASR	our job was to bring some pics
71-2_3861.92_7.327.wav_ASR	and usually we would bring something else whether it be cranberry or something else bread something
71-2_3869.707_2.393.wav_ASR	but we never made the tour
71-2_3872.607_2.173.wav_ASR	you are never responsive for doing any of that
71-2_3874.78_1.654.wav_ASR	and we were talking
71-2_3876.434_0.914.wav_ASR	they're playing a game
71-2_3877.82_5.48.wav_ASR	you know i'd hang up with my in the kitchen with the women because they were kind of restricted that
71-2_3883.46_1.96.wav_ASR	the man would be in the living room watching football
71-2_3886.28_4.902.wav_ASR	and yeah you would just try to do with those journal
71-2_3891.42_2.44.wav_ASR	but anyway i was by myself
71-2_3893.937_6.46.wav_ASR	if i think it was a center in
71-2_3903.017_2.6.wav_ASR	and i was working as a waitress
71-2_3906.217_1.753.wav_ASR	and i didn't have a car
71-2_3909.03_2.46.wav_ASR	and i couldn't get enough time off from work
71-2_3911.917_1.736.wav_ASR	and i didn't have enough surgery there
71-2_3913.653_4.9.wav_ASR	so whatever reason i hadta work on wednesday before thursday
71-2_3919.253_1.48.wav_ASR	and i was gonna be depressed
71-2_3920.873_2.933.wav_ASR	but i was gonna miss this big family event
71-2_3924.413_4.96.wav_ASR	but i decided that i was still going to make sure that i had the trap
71-2_3929.773_1.74.wav_ASR	but i still had trouble
71-2_3931.715_1.84.wav_ASR	but i still had
71-2_3934.135_1.48.wav_ASR	that i still had dress
71-2_3935.995_1.437.wav_ASR	and those are the things i liked anyway
71-2_3937.995_2.438.wav_ASR	so i'm gonna go through this because now i'm adult right
71-2_3940.455_1.144.wav_ASR	and i know how to do all this
71-2_3941.995_1.475.wav_ASR	why shouldn't i be able to do it
71-2_3943.535_0.973.wav_ASR	it can't be hard
71-2_3945.135_1.145.wav_ASR	it comes out of the
71-2_3946.495_1.92.wav_ASR	it looks like you turn the oven on
71-2_3948.615_1.065.wav_ASR	you put the turkey in
71-2_3949.895_1.065.wav_ASR	you leave it in for a long time
71-2_3951.06_1.38.wav_ASR	five and eventually you pull it out
71-2_3952.98_1.427.wav_ASR	and then you eat it right
71-2_3954.407_0.765.wav_ASR	and i can do that
71-2_3956.5_5.3.wav_ASR	so the tuesday before thanksgiving after i'm calling
71-2_3962.12_0.88.wav_ASR	and everyone's saying
71-2_3963.12_1.013.wav_ASR	you're not gonna be here
71-2_3964.3_1.612.wav_ASR	can't believe you're not gonna be your normal
71-2_3965.912_1.841.wav_ASR	and feeling all depressed and all this
71-2_3967.94_2.64.wav_ASR	but i get how i pick up this tree
71-2_3970.948_2.557.wav_ASR	and i don't get a particularly big one
71-2_3973.708_0.995.wav_ASR	it's pretty peg
71-2_3974.748_3.832.wav_ASR	probably twenty pounds which is certainly more than i need
71-2_3979.388_1.599.wav_ASR	but you know i don't know
71-2_3981.128_5.18.wav_ASR	smaller than the ones that my family has ever used for thanksgiving
71-2_3986.648_1.44.wav_ASR	so i pick up this umbrella
71-2_3989.32_4.94.wav_ASR	after i get home from work on wednesday i pull it out of the freezer
71-2_3994.86_1.6.wav_ASR	you're kinda see where i'm going with this
71-2_3997.14_1.16.wav_ASR	pull it out of the tree
71-2_3998.92_0.655.wav_ASR	and slice
71-2_3999.94_8.707.wav_ASR	yeah i think i probably if i put it in the morning on thursday morning i should be able to eat probably like four o'clock in the afternoon
71-2_4008.6_3.427.wav_ASR	you know and you know how to make pies and all the other stuff
71-2_4012.36_2.28.wav_ASR	and i stick it in the
71-2_4015.16_2.54.wav_ASR	and i put tin foil over it
71-2_4018.12_1.74.wav_ASR	and i got the temperature core
71-2_4020.98_0.76.wav_ASR	put it in
71-2_4022.48_2.3.wav_ASR	and you know in the meantime time i'm getting really hungry
71-2_4025.22_1.08.wav_ASR	see the day's going on
71-2_4026.96_2.58.wav_ASR	the owner smells really good
71-2_4030.16_1.799.wav_ASR	my favorite got the pines that are
71-2_4032.82_2.322.wav_ASR	but i bought the pies because i didn't have time to bake them
71-2_4035.7_1.44.wav_ASR	and i go home and say something
71-2_4037.36_0.82.wav_ASR	and i'm watching tv
71-2_4038.6_1.326.wav_ASR	and so it's about four o'clock
71-2_4040.14_5.623.wav_ASR	and i invited my next door neighbor to come over and help thank you with me
71-2_4045.6_2.7.wav_ASR	and i pull out the other one
71-2_4048.88_8.18.wav_ASR	up i open the other door pull out the the turkey and take off the tin foil
71-2_4058.22_5.156.wav_ASR	and all of a sudden i notice it's still kind of rough on the top
71-2_4063.76_1.56.wav_ASR	it's
71-2_4065.473_3.02.wav_ASR	what apparently i didn't understand you had to talk them
71-2_4068.773_3.506.wav_ASR	and i didn't know that there's actually a progress that yes
71-2_4072.673_10.555.wav_ASR	so what i have is a turkey which is over cooked on the top part of it
71-2_4083.413_1.1.wav_ASR	it's blood everywhere
71-2_4084.791_4.6.wav_ASR	oh you know these you know when you wake up you're sposta have clear june
71-2_4089.731_1.877.wav_ASR	oh i'm having blood coming out of it
71-2_4092.3_1.672.wav_ASR	well i've got my next year's name
71-2_4094.631_1.127.wav_ASR	so one hour we're gonna eat it
71-2_4095.771_0.429.wav_ASR	and i said
71-2_4096.271_1.769.wav_ASR	well it looks like it's not done yet
71-2_4098.231_1.569.wav_ASR	and i don't know why's taking this long
71-2_4101.011_1.629.wav_ASR	and i said
71-2_4103.091_0.989.wav_ASR	well let's just see the guy
71-2_4104.66_1.34.wav_ASR	so i put it back in the
71-2_4106.3_0.82.wav_ASR	we eat the pot
71-2_4107.6_2.94.wav_ASR	we started eating you know whatever i've got in the house
71-2_4110.92_3.32.wav_ASR	and i keep opening the oven door and checking on it
71-2_4114.46_1.1.wav_ASR	they're not done yet
71-2_4115.9_3.62.wav_ASR	and then finally at this point my my neighbor said
71-2_4119.66_2.687.wav_ASR	you know i'm not really hungry anymore because we've been eating
71-2_4122.347_5.32.wav_ASR	pick i had some macaroni and cheese and the refrigerator
71-2_4127.947_0.653.wav_ASR	we eating that
71-2_4128.987_0.853.wav_ASR	they're always have the phone
71-2_4130.887_1.513.wav_ASR	you know we eating other stuff
71-2_4132.587_2.053.wav_ASR	they're drunk and beer pretty much at that point
71-2_4135.127_1.673.wav_ASR	and it's still just wasn't done
71-2_4136.987_0.32.wav_ASR	but i said
71-2_4137.427_1.789.wav_ASR	think there's something wrong with my
71-2_4139.216_4.64.wav_ASR	for whatever reason this bird did not catch
71-2_4144.716_6.64.wav_ASR	so basically i finally took it out of the oven and stuck it back in the refrigerator
71-2_4152.1_1.576.wav_ASR	it was half cook
71-2_4154.1_6.54.wav_ASR	and then i found out the next day from my aunt that it was sposta have been thought probably three or four days and a half
71-2_4161.66_3.14.wav_ASR	that's that's the only way that it's cooked evenly
71-2_4164.8_10.968.wav_ASR	and i never told anybody other than my aunt that the reason that my turkey did not work out is not because i forgot the thought
71-2_4175.98_2.66.wav_ASR	but because i told her the number just didn't work
71-2_4178.98_0.94.wav_ASR	that's the cat
71-2_4180.26_1.499.wav_ASR	that's the one i went with right
71-2_4181.86_0.46.wav_ASR	they did not
71-2_4182.62_1.64.wav_ASR	they would laugh at me forever
71-2_4184.269_5.704.wav_ASR	they've required me for degrees for not knowing something as basic as that
71-2_4190.749_3.091.wav_ASR	but it's the first bird i ever tried to fish
71-2_4194.709_2.56.wav_ASR	they needta tell you the details
71-2_4197.749_2.931.wav_ASR	meanwhile there's more involved than just sticking in the tree
71-2_4201.309_1.4.wav_ASR	so anyway yeah
71-2_4202.869_1.276.wav_ASR	oh i didn't even tell you
71-2_4204.145_0.66.wav_ASR	but i didn't take
71-2_4205.385_11.22.wav_ASR	the neck was actually inside paper and was stuck inside the current which i didn't even know because it was too frustrating
71-2_4217.465_4.355.wav_ASR	so i finally was able to get it out i had paper in there too on top of me
71-2_4222.245_1.467.wav_ASR	oh come on mom
71-2_4223.712_2.033.wav_ASR	especially i ate it
71-2_4225.772_5.36.wav_ASR	well i just happed it up and then kinda cooked it in sauce
71-2_4231.613_1.392.wav_ASR	but i use it all
71-2_4244.36_0.39.wav_ASR	let's see
71-2_4246.12_3.22.wav_ASR	oh okay
71-2_4250.31_12.91.wav_ASR	going to talk about hotel that i stayed in when i was living in kootenay and was traveling with five other people
71-2_4263.273_6.26.wav_ASR	now in this particular case what had happened is we were on christmas break
71-2_4270.133_3.68.wav_ASR	so we had a month off in which they were no classes
71-2_4274.793_1.429.wav_ASR	and so all of us
71-2_4276.413_2.08.wav_ASR	we were about twenty five of us there
71-2_4278.663_5.439.wav_ASR	we were between the ages of nineteen and twenty one and were in europe
71-2_4284.483_8.28.wav_ASR	and we have the ability to be able to buy url passes which means unlimited travel
71-2_4293.323_0.72.wav_ASR	you're basically
71-2_4294.543_3.437.wav_ASR	can't remember what it costs at this point
71-2_4297.98_2.54.wav_ASR	but i think it was about a hundred dollars you paid
71-2_4300.82_16.44.wav_ASR	and you could essentially go anywhere as far south as grace and as far north as firstnamel
71-2_4317.626_3.34.wav_ASR	so you know we had all these ways of trying to do it check
71-2_4321.286_2.024.wav_ASR	you know we'd sleep on on the couch
71-2_4323.546_4.404.wav_ASR	we would take things at night so that we wouldn't hafta worry about a
71-2_4328.866_1.9.wav_ASR	but we were now
71-2_4331.086_2.44.wav_ASR	we were several of us that were traveling
71-2_4333.686_1.58.wav_ASR	it was with a friend called firstnamec
71-2_4335.298_4.36.wav_ASR	and we were connecting with firstnames and firstnamec
71-2_4339.721_2.975.wav_ASR	and and they were coming
71-2_4342.838_1.313.wav_ASR	they traveled somewhere else
71-2_4344.198_2.045.wav_ASR	we're all gonna meet together in nine
71-2_4346.718_4.949.wav_ASR	and we figured we would all stay in a hotel together to save money you know
71-2_4351.738_2.52.wav_ASR	you would have two bread
71-2_4354.57_1.472.wav_ASR	so there was a cat
71-2_4356.47_1.518.wav_ASR	and one of us would sleep with the kitten
71-2_4357.988_3.735.wav_ASR	and then two women would be in the other bath
71-2_4362.65_1.8.wav_ASR	so it's new york city right
71-2_4364.61_1.672.wav_ASR	because this is christmas break
71-2_4366.73_2.06.wav_ASR	we arrive in
71-2_4369.51_2.46.wav_ASR	and the first thing we we would do when
71-2_4372.105_3.44.wav_ASR	and we were gonna meet with each other at the train station
71-2_4376.45_1.74.wav_ASR	we all met at the train station
71-2_4378.485_2.025.wav_ASR	we all got in within half an hour of each other
71-2_4380.725_0.585.wav_ASR	we connected
71-2_4381.31_17.334.wav_ASR	in the first thing we would always do is go to the the insurance center in the training station and get the maps and find out what's going on in the city and you know basically what we were gonna be
71-2_4399.31_1.66.wav_ASR	there's a guy there working
71-2_4400.97_1.48.wav_ASR	and he was about twenty
71-2_4402.65_5.436.wav_ASR	very traditional american man who said
71-2_4408.77_2.324.wav_ASR	he was just starting to flatten with us
71-2_4410.93_1.58.wav_ASR	oh they're three emergency workers
71-2_4412.97_0.805.wav_ASR	the one guy
71-2_4414.09_1.187.wav_ASR	he's traveling with us
71-2_4415.73_2.32.wav_ASR	and he just said
71-2_4418.51_1.44.wav_ASR	oh you're gonna be in
71-2_4420.19_0.352.wav_ASR	we said
71-2_4420.542_1.785.wav_ASR	yeah we're gonna be in a couple of days
71-2_4423.022_0.528.wav_ASR	here's a plant
71-2_4423.642_1.191.wav_ASR	well we don't have plenty
71-2_4425.142_0.92.wav_ASR	we're just traveling
71-2_4426.362_1.68.wav_ASR	we were open to any experience
71-2_4428.462_0.4.wav_ASR	he says
71-2_4428.922_1.677.wav_ASR	oh we're gonna have a party tonight
71-2_4431.182_1.62.wav_ASR	would you like to come to our party
71-2_4433.777_1.345.wav_ASR	and of course you know
71-2_4435.601_1.401.wav_ASR	course it'll come to your party
71-2_4437.262_1.273.wav_ASR	we don't know anybody here

71-2_4440.046_0.685.wav_ASR	smack you see
71-2_4440.731_1.855.wav_ASR	we loved to go to an italian party
71-2_4442.966_1.106.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
71-2_4444.486_4.06.wav_ASR	have seen the movie the taking taking which means it could go on very different
71-2_4448.786_0.842.wav_ASR	that's not what happened
71-2_4450.606_1.32.wav_ASR	so we get our hotel
71-2_4453.086_0.895.wav_ASR	and we checking
71-2_4454.966_4.62.wav_ASR	and the guy behind the desk looked at all of us and said
71-2_4459.59_1.88.wav_ASR	you all wanna be in one room together
71-2_4462.21_0.62.wav_ASR	and we slipper
71-2_4463.448_1.886.wav_ASR	one room two beds
71-2_4466.53_1.558.wav_ASR	and he looked at firstnamek
71-2_4468.088_2.082.wav_ASR	and he pulled them aside and said
71-2_4470.79_1.3.wav_ASR	you must not be a toddler
71-2_4472.41_4.094.wav_ASR	if i were in that room i would not be able to sleep the entire night
71-2_4476.504_3.19.wav_ASR	the overnight night with all of these beautiful women around
71-2_4480.57_2.338.wav_ASR	and he he hadn't come out yet
71-2_4482.944_3.806.wav_ASR	but it about a year later after that when we all had a reunion
71-2_4487.104_0.926.wav_ASR	oh i'm i'm gay
71-2_4488.81_0.614.wav_ASR	oh i see
71-2_4489.544_1.514.wav_ASR	oh we we didn't know that
71-2_4491.584_4.638.wav_ASR	yeah then i was thinking at the time you know he he actually didn't know he was gay
71-2_4496.25_7.099.wav_ASR	but he said one of the things that made clear to him that he was gay as when that annual man had said
71-2_4504.19_3.358.wav_ASR	we wouldn't be able to sleep if i were in the room with these beautiful women
71-2_4508.07_0.96.wav_ASR	and he was thinking
71-2_4509.29_1.838.wav_ASR	you know i'm not interested in anything else
71-2_4511.51_1.94.wav_ASR	especially but
71-2_4513.97_1.867.wav_ASR	well maybe there's a reason for that
71-2_4515.85_1.695.wav_ASR	but anyway
71-2_4518.19_2.637.wav_ASR	so we we i actually slept with firstnamek
71-2_4520.91_0.704.wav_ASR	oh that was
71-2_4523.37_1.48.wav_ASR	there was no
71-2_4525.51_3.045.wav_ASR	they didn't matter who we were gonna sleep with
71-2_4528.59_1.436.wav_ASR	he was like my brother at that point
71-2_4530.79_1.74.wav_ASR	so firstnamek and i slept in one bed
71-2_4532.73_0.64.wav_ASR	it was a dog
71-2_4533.83_2.42.wav_ASR	and sandwich and kitty slipped in the other one
71-2_4536.43_6.242.wav_ASR	and we put all our stuff up you know our backpacks and our sleeping bags
71-2_4542.95_1.454.wav_ASR	and we all went to this party
71-2_4544.65_2.441.wav_ASR	everybody's really well dressed at this party
71-2_4547.69_2.18.wav_ASR	he were jins
71-2_4558.543_1.81.wav_ASR	everybody's all made up
71-2_4560.543_2.446.wav_ASR	they're we are looking like we look
71-2_4563.963_5.82.wav_ASR	and the whole thing at the party became the focus of
71-2_4569.795_5.22.wav_ASR	so this guy is sleeping with all three three of you in the hotel
71-2_4575.455_8.129.wav_ASR	oh that's all we talked about all night was just that firstnamek had three different women that he was having sex with
71-2_4583.835_2.445.wav_ASR	so you know
71-2_4586.535_3.105.wav_ASR	wife i could be an American man and travel with three wives
71-2_4589.64_1.073.wav_ASR	and you know it
71-2_4591.62_1.186.wav_ASR	oh kitty was so miserable
71-2_4593.08_2.472.wav_ASR	oh oh insurance by the whole thing
71-2_4595.68_0.879.wav_ASR	we
71-2_4597.78_4.75.wav_ASR	what's interesting is on the way back we stopped again in the the bathroom
71-2_4602.76_3.63.wav_ASR	firstnamek came out of the bathroom the men's bathroom and said
71-2_4607.06_1.72.wav_ASR	he's had the strings and come
71-2_4609.0_0.74.wav_ASR	and we call
71-2_4609.96_0.5.wav_ASR	happy
71-2_4610.475_1.125.wav_ASR	he said
71-2_4611.66_1.84.wav_ASR	oh i was at the year and a half
71-2_4614.02_1.751.wav_ASR	and i was standing there
71-2_4615.94_0.733.wav_ASR	and i was pee
71-2_4617.72_1.59.wav_ASR	and all of a sudden this man came in
71-2_4619.54_4.24.wav_ASR	he he could go to the other side of the room of the umbrella
71-2_4624.08_1.411.wav_ASR	came and stood right next to me
71-2_4626.74_0.6.wav_ASR	and he said
71-2_4627.405_1.298.wav_ASR	and i don't know what that means
71-2_4628.703_0.68.wav_ASR	and i said
71-2_4630.703_0.392.wav_ASR	oh maybe
71-2_4631.095_1.208.wav_ASR	yeah it's terrible you know
71-2_4632.523_0.44.wav_ASR	he said
71-2_4633.223_4.051.wav_ASR	he had the biggest piece i'd ever seen
71-2_4637.563_0.429.wav_ASR	oh
71-2_4638.163_1.275.wav_ASR	oh some how
71-2_4640.283_2.322.wav_ASR	thinking about that a year later kind of made sense
71-2_4642.723_0.997.wav_ASR	at the time i was
71-2_4643.84_0.556.wav_ASR	come on
71-2_4644.543_1.18.wav_ASR	maybe this is what it'll be
71-2_4645.732_10.149.wav_ASR	we just thought annual men were so strange that somebody they would not be able to sleep in a fully closed woman and not be able to sleep when he's exhausted exhausted
71-2_4656.872_1.771.wav_ASR	could not sleep if i were in that room
71-2_4658.952_2.411.wav_ASR	just couldn't manage all those women around them
71-2_4661.432_1.043.wav_ASR	we were sharing a bathroom
71-2_4663.072_0.5.wav_ASR	oh my
71-2_4663.885_1.9.wav_ASR	oh anyway yeah
71-2_4665.989_3.342.wav_ASR	that's better than the one where i hadta say
71-2_4669.685_0.92.wav_ASR	you have any questions
71-2_4670.828_2.306.wav_ASR	and which is what i hafta give you last week
71-2_4673.345_2.38.wav_ASR	but i don't have a lot a lot of hotel story
71-2_4676.085_0.796.wav_ASR	yeah anyway
71-2_4677.505_0.76.wav_ASR	that was nice
71-2_4683.67_0.73.wav_ASR	okay
71-2_4684.79_1.88.wav_ASR	we've already talked about my okay
71-2_4687.29_1.19.wav_ASR	so i come up with a different word
71-2_4688.98_22.04.wav_ASR	oh i useta have this thing that i would do to family members and friends which involved them in restaurants on their holiday's they're birthday in perfect
71-2_4711.28_5.98.wav_ASR	and what i would do is i would usually go quiet
71-2_4718.12_0.593.wav_ASR	we get up
71-2_4718.88_1.542.wav_ASR	excuse myself in the taxi
71-2_4720.7_0.485.wav_ASR	they were gone
71-2_4721.32_1.92.wav_ASR	and i would talk to the waitress
71-2_4723.38_1.18.wav_ASR	and i would say something like
71-2_4724.78_0.758.wav_ASR	it's my cousin
71-2_4725.64_1.14.wav_ASR	it's his birthday today
71-2_4727.48_2.1.wav_ASR	he doesn't like any attention
71-2_4729.698_4.925.wav_ASR	and so is there any point in time in which you could bring us a package
71-2_4734.623_3.695.wav_ASR	and then we could really appreciate him by singing really loudly
71-2_4738.31_3.62.wav_ASR	and usually the waitress staff they're always
71-2_4742.318_0.971.wav_ASR	we love to do that
71-2_4743.298_0.762.wav_ASR	that would be fun
71-2_4744.738_1.792.wav_ASR	so i had this thing about doing that
71-2_4746.63_5.9.wav_ASR	and very often i would write my own hands the kind that don't blow out
71-2_4752.99_5.848.wav_ASR	the oh yeah they they they relate because then you can really really appreciate people
71-2_4758.97_1.497.wav_ASR	yeah that was my pain
71-2_4761.43_2.915.wav_ASR	oh it was my customers' birthday
71-2_4764.86_4.14.wav_ASR	and his relationship with his girlfriend had just ended
71-2_4769.48_3.76.wav_ASR	he's always kind of quiet and and shy
71-2_4774.06_7.648.wav_ASR	so i decided that what we should really do is we should call a lot of attention to him because this was would be good for him
71-2_4782.483_4.66.wav_ASR	so there were about fifteen of us there in the family
71-2_4787.403_2.28.wav_ASR	we were all sitting in the same room
71-2_4790.743_1.267.wav_ASR	we were in the same boat
71-2_4792.783_6.78.wav_ASR	but i decide that would actually add to the environment if we had people singing from a distance around him
71-2_4800.425_7.26.wav_ASR	oh i i took my niece and nephew with me to talk to the waitress staff
71-2_4808.085_1.875.wav_ASR	and matty was then six
71-2_4810.545_1.415.wav_ASR	and evan was eighteen
71-2_4812.62_1.14.wav_ASR	so they came with me
71-2_4813.825_0.36.wav_ASR	and i said
71-2_4814.405_1.486.wav_ASR	it's what we're gonna do today
71-2_4815.905_1.236.wav_ASR	oh we're gonna go home
71-2_4817.285_1.99.wav_ASR	we're going to surprise him on his birthday
71-2_4819.275_11.285.wav_ASR	so what we hafta do is is we hafta make sure that everybody understands that they shouldn't know in advance
71-2_4831.135_4.64.wav_ASR	so firstnamed is over talking to i don't know some other relative
71-2_4836.42_3.78.wav_ASR	and firstnamem and firstnamee and i are running around talking to everybody
71-2_4840.48_2.887.wav_ASR	oh okay now you hafta sing very loud
71-2_4843.64_1.672.wav_ASR	you gotta be very very quiet
71-2_4845.6_1.096.wav_ASR	yes yes
71-2_4847.02_9.14.wav_ASR	so he hears daddy talking to the i think it was his brother probably my other cousin saying
71-2_4856.255_2.8.wav_ASR	now remember to sing very very loud
71-2_4859.535_1.02.wav_ASR	the umbrella
71-2_4861.135_1.305.wav_ASR	and enjoy this whole princess
71-2_4864.14_0.78.wav_ASR	it was just like
71-2_4865.495_0.665.wav_ASR	can you be some guy
71-2_4866.355_0.48.wav_ASR	he's gone
71-2_4867.715_1.611.wav_ASR	what are they going to do
71-2_4869.355_1.262.wav_ASR	he knew something was coming
71-2_4871.42_5.18.wav_ASR	but he didn't know about the type of protection that we had put in place
71-2_4876.94_5.5.wav_ASR	they didn't know about the special hands that wouldn't blend out
71-2_4882.7_11.06.wav_ASR	he didn't know that we were gonna get the the entire waste waste waste waste people were waiting on the tables to bring it
71-2_4894.34_6.12.wav_ASR	and he didn't know that everybody in my family would really enjoy the entire process
71-2_4900.46_6.912.wav_ASR	and you know we get very kind of loud when we do things like this
71-2_4907.74_2.645.wav_ASR	oh yeah of course they came from behind
71-2_4910.64_5.579.wav_ASR	and i only thought one food service was going to bring the cake
71-2_4917.02_1.8.wav_ASR	instead we had six six our own
71-2_4919.0_1.337.wav_ASR	everybody decide to come along
71-2_4920.337_2.048.wav_ASR	oh my god
71-2_4922.677_1.435.wav_ASR	they came from boston
71-2_4924.697_6.411.wav_ASR	he could tell that it was coming because everybody on the other side or running and looking at him
71-2_4931.777_2.24.wav_ASR	and firstnamem and evan or just last
71-2_4934.457_1.743.wav_ASR	but really looking around and telling me
71-2_4936.937_0.93.wav_ASR	it's time to sing now
71-2_4938.097_0.862.wav_ASR	it's time to sing
71-2_4938.959_2.806.wav_ASR	yeah and he got drenched got drenched
71-2_4941.979_0.74.wav_ASR	he's sorry
71-2_4943.099_1.014.wav_ASR	he blew it out
71-2_4944.419_1.009.wav_ASR	came back up again
71-2_4945.559_0.321.wav_ASR	and i said
71-2_4946.139_1.029.wav_ASR	you must be getting ol
71-2_4947.999_3.841.wav_ASR	are you at least have the ability to blow out the candle
71-2_4951.84_1.08.wav_ASR	it's can you least do that
71-2_4953.279_0.841.wav_ASR	and then
71-2_4955.019_0.65.wav_ASR	come on
71-2_4955.879_0.703.wav_ASR	it's going on
71-2_4956.739_1.861.wav_ASR	and he's looking at me
71-2_4958.6_2.165.wav_ASR	and he got down and said
71-2_4961.02_4.396.wav_ASR	oh pal i gotta remember this
71-2_4965.96_1.081.wav_ASR	uhhuh i remember this
71-2_4967.18_0.36.wav_ASR	and i said
71-2_4967.76_1.097.wav_ASR	was it surprised
71-2_4968.88_0.538.wav_ASR	he's
71-2_4969.54_2.689.wav_ASR	it was not a surprise when i heard firstnamem saying
71-2_4972.7_2.78.wav_ASR	remember to sing very very loud
71-2_4976.56_11.193.wav_ASR	so i will say that i i you know i i i think i handed the warranty i think i gave her twenty dollars or something what she had done because she carried it off so well
71-2_4988.7_0.52.wav_ASR	yeah
71-2_4989.46_1.132.wav_ASR	it was so much fun
71-2_4990.7_0.32.wav_ASR	and she said
71-2_4991.1_1.881.wav_ASR	the family's oh so much fun
71-2_4992.981_3.44.wav_ASR	and and firstnamed just looked at me and just
71-2_4998.102_3.085.wav_ASR	well alright yeah anyway that was fun
71-2_5001.681_0.427.wav_ASR	but it's
71-2_5016.87_9.94.wav_ASR	back in the days when i would make peanut butter and jelly sandwich because of course i can't anymore for all sorts of reasons
71-2_5026.95_5.193.wav_ASR	slipper is saturated fast and too much shoe and all the rest of it
71-2_5032.23_5.632.wav_ASR	but back the days when i would have done this oh what i would have done as i would have started out with the bread
71-2_5038.61_13.295.wav_ASR	and i would toast it because the taste text of toast works better for me than it does with toasted bread when it comes to peanut butter and jelly
71-2_5052.65_3.64.wav_ASR	so i would begin by putting it in the toaster
71-2_5056.23_6.16.wav_ASR	and while it's toasted up i would pull out the peanut butter and the jelly
71-2_5063.89_6.546.wav_ASR	when the bread comes out of the toaster i would begin with the peanut butter
71-2_5070.71_0.899.wav_ASR	that goes on the bottom
71-2_5071.89_4.232.wav_ASR	but i would pull out some peanut butter
71-2_5076.47_2.8.wav_ASR	three i would spread it evenly on the bread
71-2_5079.93_2.64.wav_ASR	then i would take the other piece of toast
71-2_5083.17_7.54.wav_ASR	and i would take a spoon and spoon out some jelly
71-2_5091.25_1.174.wav_ASR	write it around even
71-2_5093.29_1.54.wav_ASR	and then put the two of them together
71-2_5095.33_3.74.wav_ASR	and probably slice it before eat it
71-2_5100.37_1.46.wav_ASR	but i don't eat things like that anymore
71-2_5102.25_1.58.wav_ASR	that's how i would do it
71-2_5111.35_0.5.wav_ASR	oh
71-2_5112.173_4.003.wav_ASR	well i think we talked about this last week
71-2_5116.353_4.662.wav_ASR	and i'm not done my laundry since last week which means i really needta do it at this point
71-2_5122.17_24.64.wav_ASR	when i do laundry what i'm able to do is not separate them separate them from color and white because i've gotten to the point that i only buy clothes that can all be washed in cold water which is also much better than the previous separation of them separate them from color and white because i've gotten to the point that i only buy clothes that can all be washed in cold water which is also much better than the previous separation of them separate them from color and white because i've gotten to the point that i only buy clothes that can all be washed in cold water which is also much better than the previous separation of them separate them from color and white because i've gotten to the point that i only buy clothes that can all be washed in cold water which is also much better than the previous separation of them separate them from color and white because i've gotten to the point that i only buy clothes that can all be washed in cold water which is also much better than the previous separation of them separate
71-2_5147.64_14.38.wav_ASR	so all of my dirty laundry is already put aside because as clothes begin to fall the smell tests they end up in my bedroom
71-2_5163.84_1.68.wav_ASR	so when it's time to do laundry
71-2_5205.68_2.96.wav_ASR	my plan is probably tomorrow
71-2_5208.96_5.54.wav_ASR	have a break between two different points that will allow me to do that
71-2_5214.8_4.46.wav_ASR	what i'm going to do is i pull into the laundry which is on each side
71-2_5221.0_3.28.wav_ASR	one i think it's about twenty one hundred
71-2_5224.612_5.38.wav_ASR	one i will walk into a medium size washing machine
71-2_5230.452_2.529.wav_ASR	and i will put all of my laundry in
71-2_5233.212_2.606.wav_ASR	well not separate it by color or white
71-2_5236.572_4.435.wav_ASR	and i will then add the soup sorry the soup at the top of it
71-2_5241.89_6.96.wav_ASR	then i will put in enough quarters to be able to begin the cycle
71-2_5249.67_3.44.wav_ASR	and i will wash on my clothes on top
71-2_5253.83_7.3.wav_ASR	after the quarters are in i push the cold water water
71-2_5261.412_5.86.wav_ASR	and then i take note of the fact that it will take twenty five minutes for it to wash
71-2_5300.51_7.94.wav_ASR	because it's twolves and sweaters and things and sweat shirts that will take longer to to dry
71-2_5309.73_7.36.wav_ASR	and then i threw it all back in the hamper and take it home and then sometimes unfold it or put it away
71-2_5317.17_8.72.wav_ASR	and sometimes i just take write out of the paper and put it on my my my body or my bed or whatever i need
71-2_5335.726_1.6.wav_ASR	thank you
71-2_5338.086_0.904.wav_ASR	well i've never done that
71-2_5339.206_1.26.wav_ASR	oh i have tried
71-2_5341.05_1.916.wav_ASR	well make very clear that i have tried
71-2_5343.826_8.14.wav_ASR	and i have not ever succeeded in doing so for different reasons
71-2_5352.99_2.016.wav_ASR	if i wanted to do it correct
71-2_5355.43_3.92.wav_ASR	and this is what it says on the seed
71-2_5360.33_1.64.wav_ASR	which has never worked for me
71-2_5362.41_2.88.wav_ASR	but this is essentially the way that we would do it
71-2_5365.51_1.04.wav_ASR	and i would get
71-2_5368.81_1.36.wav_ASR	or i would get
71-2_5370.83_2.38.wav_ASR	and i would go to a plant
71-2_5374.88_3.677.wav_ASR	and there is one that's about a mile and half from where i live
71-2_5378.64_3.28.wav_ASR	and you buy a special type of
71-2_5384.1_1.523.wav_ASR	it it it comes in a bag
71-2_5385.8_1.105.wav_ASR	and i think it's it's
71-2_5387.32_6.933.wav_ASR	oh i know it's that it's it's final enough that you should be able to grow things on it
71-2_5394.253_3.88.wav_ASR	and i would put this into a pot
71-2_5398.493_12.547.wav_ASR	one i would make sure that there was a hole in it for legs so that if you put the water in the water it's excessive water will be able to drain out into a tray
71-2_5412.06_6.94.wav_ASR	put the pot near a window so that there's enough
71-2_5420.54_3.72.wav_ASR	and what i would do is make sure that the
71-2_5424.56_4.012.wav_ASR	first i would read the directions on the seat package which i've done before
71-2_5429.36_2.358.wav_ASR	you hafta go down about two inches
71-2_5431.718_2.05.wav_ASR	you take a seed
71-2_5434.438_1.243.wav_ASR	you place it
71-2_5436.118_0.689.wav_ASR	you cover
71-2_5437.218_1.782.wav_ASR	you water it
71-2_5439.278_1.558.wav_ASR	then you leave it alone
71-2_5441.258_2.82.wav_ASR	supposedly neighbor takes its course
71-2_5444.438_5.88.wav_ASR	in my particular situation one time i didn't have enough
71-2_5451.69_10.26.wav_ASR	another time i simply over water it to the point that the the soil was so saturated that the seed root
71-2_5463.05_8.069.wav_ASR	and i think the other time it's too cold in my apartment to be able to sprawl in the way that it was sposta be able to sprawl in the way that it was sposta be able to sprawl
71-2_5471.119_2.542.wav_ASR	but i've seen other people do it
71-2_5473.819_1.78.wav_ASR	and i know the process exists
71-2_5475.839_4.031.wav_ASR	and i've just been able to actually do it in a way that makes it exactly work
71-2_5480.75_10.703.wav_ASR	so yeah i'm still in the temporary status of understanding of what you're sposta be able to do
71-2_5491.453_11.589.wav_ASR	but i haven't yet figured out how to keep the soil dry enough so that it it can spread without me overwatering it too much
71-2_5503.85_5.443.wav_ASR	so i think there's a balance i haven't yet achieved to be able to do it
84-1_17.07_2.48.wav_ASR	one of my favorite trips
84-1_19.816_4.091.wav_ASR	my wife and i have two sons that are older now
84-1_24.096_5.94.wav_ASR	and for a number of years we went skiing in utah
84-1_31.276_2.24.wav_ASR	and i really enjoyed the opportunity
84-1_33.838_6.2.wav_ASR	so my youngest was probably about three years old and my oldest was probably
84-1_40.738_1.181.wav_ASR	oh it's probably a little later
84-1_42.198_2.46.wav_ASR	me five and six
84-1_45.878_4.42.wav_ASR	it was just so much fun to get out there and and
84-1_50.529_3.88.wav_ASR	but i i could ski already but my two kids
84-1_55.149_1.45.wav_ASR	my wife's little bit
84-1_56.809_3.24.wav_ASR	my two kids became pretty good skiers
84-1_60.329_3.354.wav_ASR	pretty sure that a lot of them was done
84-1_63.693_8.407.wav_ASR	we had a guide when we were in in in
84-1_72.333_1.915.wav_ASR	and i just lost the name of the place
84-1_74.633_3.58.wav_ASR	and when we were in the united states
84-1_78.653_2.88.wav_ASR	and we were gifted with him for a number of years
84-1_81.538_1.66.wav_ASR	he did a really good job
84-1_83.198_9.633.wav_ASR	and i hope that will give you a little bit of sense of how much i enjoyed skiing with them while when i could
84-1_100.218_1.397.wav_ASR	it it was very nice
84-1_127.149_12.52.wav_ASR	well i just i just got exceeded to be part of the bar again in virginia and pennsylvania
84-1_141.089_3.08.wav_ASR	my my skills
84-1_144.711_5.549.wav_ASR	oh i i i i i think my skills are pretty good
84-1_150.311_2.822.wav_ASR	they're never gonna be great as they once were
84-1_153.811_8.199.wav_ASR	so i would say on a scale of one to ten right now i would say probably ass
84-1_162.21_3.04.wav_ASR	so i feel like i made a lot of progress
84-1_165.81_5.761.wav_ASR	but i know that there's more progress i needta make especially with with big words
84-1_172.07_1.91.wav_ASR	big words can be difficult for me
84-1_174.17_3.53.wav_ASR	so i do see a speech therapist once a week
84-1_177.77_3.733.wav_ASR	and she's been extremely extremely helpful for me
84-1_181.503_0.887.wav_ASR	and i like her
84-1_182.39_6.734.wav_ASR	and i also have somebody that some some work out with me
84-1_189.203_1.429.wav_ASR	the two of them are just great
84-1_196.9_1.27.wav_ASR	oh i remember that pretty well
84-1_207.12_2.95.wav_ASR	well my wife was away for the week
84-1_210.39_2.78.wav_ASR	he had a house in oxford maryland
84-1_214.15_3.64.wav_ASR	and i remember that weekend because i hadta work
84-1_217.968_4.82.wav_ASR	and i thought the biggest thing we i could do for the week was to stay home
84-1_223.738_8.03.wav_ASR	so i think she probably went down there on maybe wednesday or thursday
84-1_232.508_2.66.wav_ASR	and i came home from work on friday
84-1_236.128_0.848.wav_ASR	had dinner
84-1_236.976_0.998.wav_ASR	and i did some work
84-1_238.176_2.0.wav_ASR	and i get up the next morning
84-1_240.536_5.24.wav_ASR	but that was the thirty thirtieth of
84-1_247.676_1.721.wav_ASR	and i felt pretty good
84-1_249.716_1.188.wav_ASR	and i went about my day
84-1_251.576_2.08.wav_ASR	and i went out for a bicycle ride
84-1_254.296_1.0.wav_ASR	and i came home
84-1_255.22_20.6.wav_ASR	and that night was the night that boy oh boy was i think like a week maybe after flood was killed in in minneapolis
84-1_276.504_5.66.wav_ASR	and so on saturday night i went to bed a little bit earlier
84-1_282.524_4.46.wav_ASR	well i i thought there might be some billy
84-1_287.724_3.66.wav_ASR	and i also thought it would be helpful in the mornings
84-1_291.464_1.784.wav_ASR	so i could clean up a little bit
84-1_293.7_2.69.wav_ASR	so we live in a fairly nice area
84-1_297.14_2.43.wav_ASR	and i went to bed around ten thirty
84-1_300.6_5.7.wav_ASR	and that night saturday night there was a lot of violence in in center city philadelphia
84-1_307.16_3.84.wav_ASR	and i remember that that the building was burned
84-1_315.929_2.242.wav_ASR	and so i got up
84-1_318.529_2.98.wav_ASR	oh i i live in a fairly secure place
84-1_322.129_4.884.wav_ASR	and the next morning i got up really early and went outside
84-1_327.229_1.08.wav_ASR	it was a total mess
84-1_329.189_1.324.wav_ASR	so i started cleaning up
84-1_331.129_3.4.wav_ASR	and sometimes during the day i felt a little bit she
84-1_334.969_1.819.wav_ASR	so i went back home
84-1_337.0_1.019.wav_ASR	and i rested for a little
84-1_338.309_1.26.wav_ASR	went out and got a paper
84-1_340.069_2.184.wav_ASR	and then i felt pretty good for the rest of the day
84-1_342.769_10.717.wav_ASR	and sometimes on that sunday night between may thirty first and august first i had my stroke
84-1_354.11_3.04.wav_ASR	and in the morning my wife could not get home to me
84-1_357.75_1.397.wav_ASR	so we have aorman here
84-1_359.39_0.831.wav_ASR	he went up
84-1_360.85_1.3.wav_ASR	and i was on the floor
84-1_362.37_2.0.wav_ASR	and so he called an ambulance
84-1_364.67_4.58.wav_ASR	my wife was in oxford maryland
84-1_369.477_7.22.wav_ASR	so she was told that i should that
84-1_377.397_1.08.wav_ASR	umbrella with a umbrella
84-1_378.897_3.68.wav_ASR	that my wife should come home
84-1_382.428_8.24.wav_ASR	and i have two sons one who's in new orleans and one who's in san francisco
84-1_391.348_6.86.wav_ASR	they were told it was probably a good idea for them to come home because i wasn't sure what was gonna happen
84-1_398.267_6.5.wav_ASR	and so i remember distinctly that i was brought into the emergency room
84-1_405.227_2.72.wav_ASR	apparently i i could not say a lot much
84-1_407.987_2.86.wav_ASR	my my voice was very garbled
84-1_411.47_14.3.wav_ASR	but the end by the end of the procedure my my wife told me later that she she wasn't sure what kind of shape i'd be
84-1_425.77_14.463.wav_ASR	but by the end of the surgery which was i had a blood vessel i was able she thought the surgeon thought that i was going to be able to live
84-1_440.31_3.579.wav_ASR	they didn't know how much exactly i'd be able to do
84-1_444.38_6.0.wav_ASR	so i i spent about eight weeks in rehab
84-1_451.21_2.29.wav_ASR	and i came out not sure what i could do
84-1_453.84_4.18.wav_ASR	so today i i feel pretty good about my voice
84-1_458.6_2.9.wav_ASR	as i said i still feel like there's more i can do
84-1_462.06_4.25.wav_ASR	so as i said i think i'm about seventy percent right now
84-1_478.63_9.28.wav_ASR	well i was in rehab for eight weeks about maybe eight blocks from here
84-1_488.29_1.76.wav_ASR	and it was a time when it was covid
84-1_490.47_3.04.wav_ASR	so it wasn't really easy for me to see people
84-1_494.13_3.84.wav_ASR	but one of the people where we live
84-1_498.084_2.28.wav_ASR	because i live in a high story building
84-1_501.2_9.29.wav_ASR	one of the persons was maybe the second or third comparison at firstnameg which is where i went to for my rehab
84-1_511.17_8.41.wav_ASR	and this person who's name is firstnamek was allowed to get two people into see me today
84-1_520.09_3.903.wav_ASR	well my two sisters came in
84-1_524.19_2.789.wav_ASR	and my my children came in
84-1_527.21_2.02.wav_ASR	and then my wife came in
84-1_529.33_4.5.wav_ASR	so i had a very good teacher
84-1_534.47_8.45.wav_ASR	and so each day i would have o t p t and speech
84-1_543.73_2.66.wav_ASR	that was every day except for saturdays and sundays
84-1_554.07_3.15.wav_ASR	well what and there's nothing i can do about it
84-1_558.98_2.94.wav_ASR	so i i mean i understood i hadta deal with that
84-1_562.65_2.916.wav_ASR	you know it's always deal with it but i try to
84-1_590.17_3.99.wav_ASR	well i hafta tell you i've had a pretty good life until my stroke
84-1_595.73_3.421.wav_ASR	one of the best things that ever happened to me was
84-1_599.151_7.46.wav_ASR	well i was in a program at a school called wesleyne which is in middle town connecticut
84-1_607.212_12.7.wav_ASR	and when i was there part of this this program i was in this conference respond it made it so that i hadta spend a semester of
84-1_620.93_9.96.wav_ASR	and during starting in seventh grade through high school and then into college i spoke french pretty well
84-1_631.61_7.66.wav_ASR	because i had a teacher in in washington who was at the time going out with one of the cup baseball players
84-1_639.596_3.36.wav_ASR	and so she was fresh
84-1_643.098_1.783.wav_ASR	and she useta talk about that a lot
84-1_645.456_2.323.wav_ASR	and so i took a class from her
84-1_648.376_1.811.wav_ASR	and somehow i did pretty well
84-1_650.376_6.36.wav_ASR	so then i was in the program at at westminster
84-1_657.064_3.6.wav_ASR	and i would say one of the happiest occasions for me was graduation
84-1_661.59_8.094.wav_ASR	well i i i went up doing pretty well at the school and even though i had gotten in on a wait list
84-1_670.684_1.52.wav_ASR	it was really exciting
84-1_672.25_9.12.wav_ASR	and i i i i i knew a bunch of people in my class but i was really close with the class of eighty
84-1_681.67_2.875.wav_ASR	and it was just a fun time for me
84-1_684.545_1.765.wav_ASR	and i was present at my funeral
84-1_687.01_6.06.wav_ASR	and i i i met somebody who became one of my closest friends
84-1_693.27_2.1.wav_ASR	he was the proposed at wednesday
84-1_695.55_2.306.wav_ASR	so i i it was really nice
84-1_698.38_8.68.wav_ASR	after i graduated from high college i spent some vacation with him and some of my roommates
84-1_707.68_2.16.wav_ASR	he he was someone who was remarried
84-1_710.58_2.476.wav_ASR	he went to higher school
84-1_713.273_5.48.wav_ASR	and at the end of his freshman year he went down he one the new new computer
84-1_719.733_2.72.wav_ASR	and he went down to the book store
84-1_722.973_3.56.wav_ASR	and he bought all books about italian restaurants
84-1_726.863_7.22.wav_ASR	so he went back to to campus and he changed
84-1_734.443_1.76.wav_ASR	he was already in los angeles
84-1_736.563_2.08.wav_ASR	he'd been undergraduate at princeton
84-1_739.263_4.24.wav_ASR	and he and he after his first year of waiting the move car he said
84-1_743.663_0.992.wav_ASR	it wasn't for me
84-1_744.8_5.82.wav_ASR	and he went to at harbor he went to a a program in international relations his
84-1_756.57_3.48.wav_ASR	yeah i i it was a good place for me
84-1_764.754_4.32.wav_ASR	and i haven't been visiting since my stroke
84-1_769.655_5.279.wav_ASR	but i useta be you know i useta be fairly involved in the university
84-1_775.834_6.1.wav_ASR	and my youngest son went there after spending a year and a half
84-1_782.807_7.94.wav_ASR	and he really really did really well at the school
84-1_790.907_3.04.wav_ASR	so i was very excited for him
84-1_828.61_2.67.wav_ASR	well i happened to know these pictures quite well
84-1_832.07_3.18.wav_ASR	it's a story about a kid playing soccer
84-1_836.05_3.3.wav_ASR	and he he he strikes the ball
84-1_839.99_3.52.wav_ASR	that went through the window of a nearby house
84-1_843.796_24.848.wav_ASR	and landed inside the house where it was taken by one of the young or middle age husband or maybe husband or just a regular person who lived in the house
84-1_868.644_20.254.wav_ASR	and then he looked out the window to see if he could figure out who may have hit hit hit the soccer ball so that landed on this lap but on his close to his lap i think
84-1_907.89_1.94.wav_ASR	the this one i'll know
84-1_909.988_8.342.wav_ASR	it's about a young boy who when he went to school he was deciding whether or not to take an umbrella
84-1_918.59_2.6.wav_ASR	he decided not to take the umbrella
84-1_921.69_2.48.wav_ASR	and it turned out that it it started raining
84-1_924.87_1.88.wav_ASR	so he went back home
84-1_926.94_1.818.wav_ASR	and he was soaking wet
84-1_929.34_2.127.wav_ASR	but apparently he changed his clothes
84-1_932.02_5.76.wav_ASR	and he went back outside with a umbrella so that he could get to school
84-1_938.24_6.041.wav_ASR	oh i assume he went to school on time but i really don't know whether that's part of the story or not
84-1_957.58_7.15.wav_ASR	so this is a little girl maybe under ten who had a cat who was stuck up in the tree
84-1_965.45_7.58.wav_ASR	so apparently the the dad got off his ladder
84-1_973.283_3.967.wav_ASR	the girl was on a tricycle
84-1_977.59_1.904.wav_ASR	he stopped and looked at the cat
84-1_979.94_19.956.wav_ASR	so the the the the the the the the father went up to get the cat
84-1_999.896_13.754.wav_ASR	and i guess the the ladder got kicked away so that the the husband was stuck up there with the cat
84-1_1014.556_2.6.wav_ASR	and the the dog started barking
84-1_1017.78_2.68.wav_ASR	and eventually the fire department came
84-1_1021.24_0.94.wav_ASR	they were evil
84-1_1022.44_0.5.wav_ASR	presume
84-1_1023.32_0.654.wav_ASR	don't know
84-1_1024.06_3.563.wav_ASR	but i think they were able to get the cat and get the man down
84-1_1188.54_7.06.wav_ASR	so this is the story about a young woman named cinderella
84-1_1196.189_19.982.wav_ASR	and she was working at a middle age lady and two people who had grown up with her and were interested in trying to get someone to marry them
84-1_1216.59_15.38.wav_ASR	so it turned out that the the that there was a young prince who was interested who was living with his family
84-1_1232.85_29.52.wav_ASR	and the young prince decided that they should get together and have a ball so that maybe the people from the community could find out if anybody if if if the people of the community the girls were possibly interested in in having a relationship with the
84-1_1263.48_2.52.wav_ASR	one i don't remember the name of the princess
84-1_1266.09_4.89.wav_ASR	but so they send her out an invitation to all the people in the community
84-1_1272.04_9.98.wav_ASR	and the two young ladies who lived with her who lived with her
84-1_1284.38_8.84.wav_ASR	her older mother decided that they would go to the ball and started getting dressed to go to the ball
84-1_1293.98_17.52.wav_ASR	but cinderella who was like a caretaker on the property and was stuck doing things like washing clothes and cleaning the floor and stuff like that she found out about them being this
84-1_1312.413_4.54.wav_ASR	and she wanted to know if there was some way she could attend
84-1_1317.593_1.78.wav_ASR	so she
84-1_1320.333_2.28.wav_ASR	don't remember exactly how it happened
84-1_1323.133_6.02.wav_ASR	but she was able to get touch with somebody i think they call the fairy
84-1_1330.065_3.52.wav_ASR	and she talked to the fairy godmother
84-1_1334.45_20.985.wav_ASR	and so while the two people from the house were going with her her her older lady to the dance she decided that she could go
84-1_1355.435_4.2.wav_ASR	so she got dressed up in fancy clothes
84-1_1360.415_5.337.wav_ASR	and she was told by the fairy godmother that she could go to the ball
84-1_1365.795_1.72.wav_ASR	but she had only one reciprocal
84-1_1368.295_2.94.wav_ASR	and that is that she would be be back by midnight
84-1_1371.407_11.811.wav_ASR	so she went to the ball and fell in love with the prince and was having a good time with the prince
84-1_1383.218_12.28.wav_ASR	but when the clock struck midnight cinderella knew that she hadta get out of there
84-1_1396.098_5.08.wav_ASR	so she raced for the door and down the steps and into the carriage
84-1_1401.35_2.26.wav_ASR	but soon the carriage
84-1_1404.69_9.9.wav_ASR	and she was by herself with i think some young people who may have been rabbits and other members of the community
84-1_1415.23_19.09.wav_ASR	so she she she found out that the the young princess was looking for the the young lady who had disappeared disappeared disappeared at midnight
84-1_1434.84_11.51.wav_ASR	and he sent out a i guess sort of plea or something that if the person was around she should please contact him
84-1_1446.76_12.16.wav_ASR	and when that didn't happen then a young man went around the village to see if anybody knew anything about this young woman
84-1_1459.92_3.1.wav_ASR	and when she went to the house that had the two
84-1_1463.595_2.1.wav_ASR	five i guess you might by now call him speak
84-1_1468.04_9.89.wav_ASR	three she i think somehow got hold of cinderella who may be watching clothes in the basement or something
84-1_1478.88_7.897.wav_ASR	and when she was brought upstairs the one shoe that had been left behind she tried on that one shoe
84-1_1486.777_13.623.wav_ASR	and it fit her so that it she knew that the the young prince was going to continue to like this young lady
84-1_1501.077_2.06.wav_ASR	and so i guess they got back together
84-1_1503.537_1.94.wav_ASR	they eventually they got married
84-1_1550.75_3.76.wav_ASR	never really had a lot of expenses with club
84-1_1555.47_3.2.wav_ASR	and i was pretty much always on time
84-1_1559.37_10.68.wav_ASR	and when i was growing up particularly when i was in high school there for some reason was no real time limit on what time i hadta get home
84-1_1570.61_8.74.wav_ASR	so i went to a lot of parties on friday night and saturday night and could come home when i wanted
84-1_1579.38_20.6.wav_ASR	but i think it was in large part because my two social workers decided that you know he that the two of them really hadta teach me how to be comprehensive with myself and then to be able to know when i was out too late
84-1_1600.084_3.495.wav_ASR	so i mean there were a few times when i was out too late
84-1_1604.124_2.309.wav_ASR	but nothing really ever happened to me
84-1_1606.924_3.866.wav_ASR	and then when i went to college i would come home during the summer time
84-1_1611.804_6.56.wav_ASR	and i remember that i was involved with the couple young ladies
84-1_1618.528_4.623.wav_ASR	but i would go out with them but i could get home whenever i wanted to
84-1_1623.52_6.58.wav_ASR	and i remember one summer i had a job that required me to be at work at six o'clock in the morning
84-1_1630.928_3.42.wav_ASR	so sometimes during the summer i would stay at all night and then go to work
84-1_1645.61_7.485.wav_ASR	well so i worked a lot particularly when i had i i turned out to be
84-1_1653.47_2.186.wav_ASR	think i may have told this story
84-1_1655.73_0.463.wav_ASR	and i sure
84-1_1656.193_3.42.wav_ASR	but i worked for a french company for a long time
84-1_1660.878_8.049.wav_ASR	and i when i had my stroke i started thinking about things i could do
84-1_1668.927_8.2.wav_ASR	because really between evaluations and between a lot of time i spent particularly with my children
84-1_1678.067_2.92.wav_ASR	they were in a town in new jersey called prince
84-1_1681.727_2.08.wav_ASR	and they both played a lot of hockey
84-1_1684.367_2.89.wav_ASR	so i never really had a lot of time
84-1_1687.246_2.783.wav_ASR	but one thing i've decided i'm going to do
84-1_1690.506_4.76.wav_ASR	within the past within the next year we're gonna be moving a little further south
84-1_1695.886_3.08.wav_ASR	and i really thought that one thing i could do was birdwatching
84-1_1699.586_2.933.wav_ASR	because i've always had an interest in that
84-1_1702.606_1.984.wav_ASR	but i've never really focused on that
84-1_1705.086_1.62.wav_ASR	and i really thought perfectly
84-1_1706.856_2.9.wav_ASR	now i write a three real bicycle
84-1_1709.936_4.506.wav_ASR	two wheel bicycles like i useta do
84-1_1714.521_16.081.wav_ASR	so i'm really hoping that we move i can learn about birds and maybe come somehow of an interest in in bird watching because i think that would be a good thing for me to do
84-1_1736.76_2.52.wav_ASR	oh so did she live in bloomington
84-1_1760.0_20.64.wav_ASR	well i i guess when i started traveling for this friend company when i started the pro when i was mainly responsible for the nighttime states canada and mexico
84-1_1780.938_3.5.wav_ASR	but they quickly figured out that i could speak
84-1_1785.098_1.94.wav_ASR	so the boys were in front
84-1_1787.898_2.948.wav_ASR	and i was one of the few boys outside of friends
84-1_1791.078_1.06.wav_ASR	and i was in the united states
84-1_1793.658_4.48.wav_ASR	oh they useta send me to various places
84-1_1798.398_5.96.wav_ASR	and i remember that i stayed in a real nice hotel in
84-1_1805.978_2.42.wav_ASR	and i also stayed in a nice hotel
84-1_1809.158_3.84.wav_ASR	it was in a nice hotel when i went to china
84-1_1813.177_5.8.wav_ASR	and i also was in a nice hotel when i was in
84-1_1822.457_6.54.wav_ASR	so i i and during one of the times i was there and it was the fourth third
84-1_1829.537_3.16.wav_ASR	so i remember that the staff brought me a little cake
84-1_1833.15_7.12.wav_ASR	so i i i i i don't really need a big hotel all though my wife likes them
84-1_1841.05_10.3.wav_ASR	well i i always thought i was in places that i could be comfortable even when even when
84-1_1851.626_2.28.wav_ASR	he i do remember saying in one whole
84-1_1854.01_5.896.wav_ASR	was in birmingham alabama for to to be part of a case that was pending
84-1_1860.446_2.235.wav_ASR	and we stayed in a god hotel
84-1_1862.726_3.066.wav_ASR	even even that turned not to be good for me
84-1_1865.941_11.7.wav_ASR	so it was a good way for me to learn about the way different hotels can treat me differently
84-1_1878.421_3.38.wav_ASR	oh i i was in a hotel in a bad part of town at burgundy
84-1_1882.0_1.381.wav_ASR	remember that pretty well
84-1_1897.088_7.408.wav_ASR	well when i was in college there was a lot of trouble
84-1_1904.816_0.654.wav_ASR	and i told you
84-1_1905.47_0.58.wav_ASR	the umbrella
84-1_1906.59_6.9.wav_ASR	and over the he was there for about about thirty thirty five years
84-1_1913.91_2.92.wav_ASR	and in nineteen ninety nine he died
84-1_1917.85_5.54.wav_ASR	but but before that time she and a group of people
84-1_1923.607_16.1.wav_ASR	there was one person from the class of sixty five one person from the class of sixty five which was me and a person from the class of eighty
84-1_1939.914_5.6.wav_ASR	the six five of us became very good friends
84-1_1945.874_9.776.wav_ASR	and every year because willy did not have any friends
84-1_1955.75_8.1.wav_ASR	he had a child who died when when he was maybe six or seven years old
84-1_1964.11_8.96.wav_ASR	and and so one thing he useta do once a quarter from december he useta go down to new york
84-1_1973.501_5.94.wav_ASR	and we stayed at we we would i went for my graduation
84-1_1979.861_3.68.wav_ASR	they went for every year after about twenty five years
84-1_1983.921_5.12.wav_ASR	well i went to a place that's no longer in existence but it's called new york
84-1_1989.678_3.6.wav_ASR	and it was a very nice
84-1_1994.718_3.712.wav_ASR	and we just had a wonderful time every year i was there
84-1_1998.43_14.51.wav_ASR	so i really think back on that a lot and remember just how much fun i had with these people and how much i still keep in contact with them
84-1_2012.94_5.74.wav_ASR	and so these these people are some very well known people
84-1_2019.2_6.8.wav_ASR	and so i've already had one of the wife's has already died
84-1_2026.88_4.22.wav_ASR	he he was the head of this thing called the the
84-1_2031.651_17.0.wav_ASR	it's a big it they work for a family
84-1_2048.851_0.828.wav_ASR	and i forgot the name
84-1_2049.811_1.4.wav_ASR	they have a huge truck
84-1_2051.568_3.28.wav_ASR	and so he's gonna retire and move back to new york
84-1_2055.648_10.086.wav_ASR	so i'm very excited that at the end of september i'm gonna be meeting with them and and these people who go back to the class sixty two
84-1_2066.128_2.086.wav_ASR	so i'm i'm looking forward to that
84-1_2068.397_8.98.wav_ASR	every day i i kind of wish i would be a little better strength than i am now
84-1_2077.677_3.26.wav_ASR	oh they all know i had a stroke
84-1_2081.677_3.36.wav_ASR	but i i'm really looking forward
84-1_2085.17_5.06.wav_ASR	mostly some days i think that maybe i shoulda go because i'm not far enough along
84-1_2090.73_1.56.wav_ASR	but it's
84-1_2093.19_1.8.wav_ASR	can't even remember what we were talking about
84-1_2100.86_4.44.wav_ASR	so so we went to this very nice restaurant
84-1_2105.464_2.296.wav_ASR	we did it for about twenty or twenty five years
84-1_2108.22_5.907.wav_ASR	and it was a good place for me and for the other people that were in the group
84-1_2114.08_11.39.wav_ASR	we useta do it every year in december because it was near the time when one of our favorite people from the class of sixty two had a birth
84-1_2132.16_4.04.wav_ASR	it was a french restaurant all
84-1_2137.66_14.62.wav_ASR	well it's if if you go back to the nineteen seventies and eighty's and look up the restaurant it's a two fifty nine east two fifty nine east
84-1_2152.28_7.02.wav_ASR	you it's in a nice old building that has three or four floors
84-1_2159.56_1.7.wav_ASR	it was exciting
84-1_2161.495_22.32.wav_ASR	and because willy would go there on three or four times throughout the year they knew he knew the staff really well so that when we came in for the birthday party it was just fantastic
84-1_2184.085_1.14.wav_ASR	it was really nice
84-1_2189.53_1.988.wav_ASR	it's not there anymore yeah
84-1_2191.525_0.84.wav_ASR	it was so
84-1_2192.725_1.984.wav_ASR	there was an order and his wife
84-1_2195.385_3.86.wav_ASR	and i think they obviously you know wasn't
84-1_2199.985_8.94.wav_ASR	and they saw the restaurant to a guy who was i think from either race or from germany
84-1_2210.365_2.624.wav_ASR	he did not do a very good job
84-1_2212.939_7.3.wav_ASR	so it i would say after three or four years it it it it didn't exist anymore
84-1_2224.89_2.489.wav_ASR	so we're going to
84-1_2228.519_2.26.wav_ASR	the fellow who it was
84-1_2231.118_5.52.wav_ASR	we wish i could remember the name of the place that he was involved in
84-1_2237.538_4.0.wav_ASR	but he he has one son who's got three wonderful children
84-1_2242.058_2.84.wav_ASR	they live in north jersey
84-1_2245.216_14.64.wav_ASR	so my my friend who's now widowed is has has fixed up a place i think in the fifty or sixties in new york
84-1_2260.677_6.594.wav_ASR	so i know that's where the party's gonna be because the apartment is apparently finished now
84-1_2267.297_1.81.wav_ASR	he's been working on it for a couple years
84-1_2290.78_3.59.wav_ASR	oh interesting enough i had one for lunch
84-1_2296.1_4.56.wav_ASR	yeah i like it once in awhile
84-1_2300.734_16.34.wav_ASR	one of the people who was in who one of the people who's part of the group from louisville is a fellow from the class of sixty five or sixty six
84-1_2317.101_4.2.wav_ASR	and he has a peanut butter and jelly sandwich every day for lunch
84-1_2321.761_2.78.wav_ASR	oh what you do as you take two pieces of bread
84-1_2325.321_9.159.wav_ASR	my bread i have my bread in the freezer because i only use a certain amount of it every day
84-1_2335.061_1.789.wav_ASR	so i take the pieces of bread out
84-1_2336.89_7.96.wav_ASR	but i i i they come to room temperature
84-1_2347.07_2.92.wav_ASR	then i have a special peanut butter that i use
84-1_2350.01_1.08.wav_ASR	they've been to the castle
84-1_2353.6_1.85.wav_ASR	well the peanut butter there's natural
84-1_2356.05_2.9.wav_ASR	oh so that's the peanut butter i buy
84-1_2359.35_3.68.wav_ASR	and i would we have a few cheers of that around
84-1_2363.63_3.48.wav_ASR	so i would open the jar take some peanut butter
84-1_2367.83_2.504.wav_ASR	and then i would take different kinds of jelly
84-1_2370.434_9.058.wav_ASR	but right now i'm on a kick where i have sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub
84-1_2380.014_1.86.wav_ASR	and i put that on the sandwich
84-1_2382.514_2.34.wav_ASR	then i close the sandwich
84-1_2385.454_3.553.wav_ASR	and you can either cut it in half or leave it whole
84-1_2389.007_2.9.wav_ASR	and for some stupid reason i always leave it whole
84-1_2392.387_1.62.wav_ASR	and i had what was a nice sandwich
84-1_2394.347_5.34.wav_ASR	so i had that about one thirty as i was preparing for my two o'clock call
84-1_2413.71_5.31.wav_ASR	well wonder is something i still try to do but i think my wife probably does more of it
84-1_2420.092_4.906.wav_ASR	oh i would choose what kind of temperature i would want it
84-1_2424.998_6.36.wav_ASR	but typically i would choose cold water because most of the stuff i needta watch is cold water
84-1_2431.958_3.042.wav_ASR	so i would in the special we have a machine
84-1_2435.278_2.14.wav_ASR	we live in the park
84-1_2437.656_7.8.wav_ASR	we live in an area that useta be that was where we hafta buy the condo
84-1_2446.076_9.42.wav_ASR	but because we're getting ready to move next year in the same building
84-1_2455.617_4.36.wav_ASR	so we would get the water's side
84-1_2461.32_13.017.wav_ASR	once the water set it it it comes out on the side
84-1_2474.39_1.33.wav_ASR	so there's nothing on the top
84-1_2476.55_1.89.wav_ASR	oh we hafta move the washer
84-1_2479.39_8.06.wav_ASR	and then we put the the laundry detergent in it and start it run
84-1_2487.48_6.74.wav_ASR	and you can see it from the
84-1_2495.135_8.325.wav_ASR	it's not something that's it's something that's easily to see from the floor
84-1_2504.52_2.52.wav_ASR	and so we put it on white
84-1_2507.302_4.58.wav_ASR	and it usually last for some reason for a hour and five minutes
84-1_2512.062_3.808.wav_ASR	but after an hour and five minutes the watch is done
84-1_2515.962_6.0.wav_ASR	if we have particular clothes that need to be put on the line
84-1_2522.162_4.18.wav_ASR	the rest of it would go into the dryer where it would dry
84-1_2526.352_8.24.wav_ASR	and then it would be ready to be folded and put in the couple of drawers that we use for for laundry
84-1_2535.332_2.932.wav_ASR	my wife has quite a few more than i do
84-1_2538.264_8.158.wav_ASR	but it's a place where we can put our stuff and use it as we needta
84-1_2557.42_3.87.wav_ASR	well you hafta understand now i have it takes me awhile
84-1_2562.42_5.82.wav_ASR	so i usually get up in the morning
84-1_2568.47_8.6.wav_ASR	and i will put on my undergarments
84-1_2578.86_3.09.wav_ASR	and then i would put on my shoe
84-1_2583.37_2.06.wav_ASR	and i would put on my socks
84-1_2586.38_6.68.wav_ASR	and then i would lie in bed for a little bit and do some exercise because exercise is very important to me
84-1_2593.52_9.62.wav_ASR	especially even though i'm nearly more than three years out it's still important for me to to get some exercise in every day
84-1_2603.74_0.96.wav_ASR	so i do that
84-1_2604.776_5.64.wav_ASR	and then i will typically once that is done i'll turn on the tv
84-1_2610.876_6.2.wav_ASR	and i'll get dressed the rest of my way which include you know my socks
84-1_2617.536_4.7.wav_ASR	you haven't seen this but i wear a brace on my right foot
84-1_2622.416_1.873.wav_ASR	so i put that on as well
84-1_2624.77_4.28.wav_ASR	and i i start my day
84-2_12.09_1.1.wav_ASR	my favorite holiday
84-2_13.79_9.28.wav_ASR	it's easily thankful because i have a very small family but usually the family comes as well as my two sons
84-2_24.03_1.468.wav_ASR	and now one of them's married
84-2_25.77_2.32.wav_ASR	and the other's gonna be married pretty soon
84-2_28.25_4.26.wav_ASR	so i look forward to a table with a few more people
84-2_32.564_2.32.wav_ASR	oh i have two sisters
84-2_35.624_2.44.wav_ASR	one of them who lives i think i told you in new york
84-2_38.244_1.46.wav_ASR	one of them who lives in chicago
84-2_40.424_2.76.wav_ASR	so they quickly come
84-2_43.573_14.028.wav_ASR	and until i had my stroke i was in charge of the cooking of the turkey which i do on a grill
84-2_58.053_1.58.wav_ASR	so it's really really nice
84-2_60.413_2.52.wav_ASR	now i don't do it on the globe anymore
84-2_63.47_4.5.wav_ASR	useta have a place at the shore but we don't have that anymore
84-2_68.71_4.28.wav_ASR	so somebody else cooks it in the oven
84-2_78.94_7.65.wav_ASR	well i've been the host for thanksgiving since my mother died in nineteen ninety nine
84-2_86.96_1.04.wav_ASR	so it's been awhile
84-2_92.66_0.372.wav_ASR	it is
84-2_93.22_2.6.wav_ASR	it's nice but it doesn't last for very long
84-2_100.512_2.1.wav_ASR	oh we celebrate honeymoon
84-2_103.112_6.44.wav_ASR	and so we we we typically we don't even give present anymore
84-2_109.668_11.36.wav_ASR	unfortunately both of the young ladies that my two sons married are both not jaded
84-2_121.788_3.708.wav_ASR	one of them i think has no relation which is fine with me
84-2_125.777_3.18.wav_ASR	and one of them i think is basically
84-2_130.297_4.6.wav_ASR	but i think she likes collecting coins as well
84-2_154.92_3.84.wav_ASR	my speech is probably the thing that i'm working on the most
84-2_159.16_7.84.wav_ASR	as you know i useta be a lawyer and i've just i've just gone back on active duty
84-2_167.46_3.07.wav_ASR	so i can still be a lord if i wanna be a lord
84-2_171.22_15.68.wav_ASR	but i i feel that a lot of times especially with small words and pronounce and with his and left and right i'm not great with it
84-2_187.36_3.34.wav_ASR	well that that like i hafta think for awhile
84-2_190.722_2.64.wav_ASR	especially now that the ladder does fall
84-2_193.622_1.4.wav_ASR	or it's all the drive
84-2_195.302_2.954.wav_ASR	oh i hafta remember which is left and which is right
84-2_198.782_1.54.wav_ASR	that confuses me sometimes
84-2_200.742_3.33.wav_ASR	and i'm pretty good about back and forth
84-2_204.582_2.796.wav_ASR	and i'm hoping that i'll be able to drive at some point
84-2_207.378_8.784.wav_ASR	he's not that i really wanna drive because i've always driven a lot but i've never been particularly interested in driving
84-2_216.44_9.7.wav_ASR	just do it because my wife sits in the other seat and my two kids when they were around sometimes they would drive but sometimes they would all sit in the back
84-2_227.22_6.2.wav_ASR	but but now since my stroke my wife does all the driving
84-2_234.05_6.33.wav_ASR	and as i say i think maybe in a year or so i may be able to start driving again
84-2_240.74_0.76.wav_ASR	and i'm not sure
84-2_247.16_2.58.wav_ASR	don't tell my wife that yes it's true
84-2_257.54_0.74.wav_ASR	yeah yeah yeah
84-2_263.0_2.98.wav_ASR	oh yeah i i remember my stroke pretty well
84-2_273.18_11.211.wav_ASR	well i was in the hospital for about eight days before i went to the rehab program which is also connected to tom morris hospital
84-2_285.39_20.682.wav_ASR	and that's where in my area of town which is near new york square we go down instead of going up to penn which is probably about maybe ten blocks from here we go down to junction which is probably around about the same
84-2_306.65_15.44.wav_ASR	and i remember you know i think i told you that on sunday morning i went out because there was a riot the night before from the guy up in minneapolis
84-2_322.53_1.5.wav_ASR	forget his name right now
84-2_324.03_2.88.wav_ASR	so there's a huge ride
84-2_327.03_2.723.wav_ASR	we had a building actually built here
84-2_330.29_4.617.wav_ASR	and i went out at about six o'clock in the morning to start cleaning up
84-2_335.07_2.209.wav_ASR	and i was one of the few people out there
84-2_337.63_2.1.wav_ASR	and i remember they're being a type of clone
84-2_339.843_5.105.wav_ASR	and so i was there from about six to nine o'clock in the morning
84-2_345.103_1.957.wav_ASR	and then i went to get a new job
84-2_347.387_0.994.wav_ASR	they didn't feel great
84-2_348.683_2.769.wav_ASR	so i write write lay down for a little bit
84-2_351.763_2.48.wav_ASR	and then i went to work in the afternoon
84-2_354.303_6.287.wav_ASR	and by the evening i was starting to feel a little worse but not terribly worse
84-2_361.05_2.15.wav_ASR	and i went to bed around ten thirty
84-2_364.003_2.577.wav_ASR	and i had my stroke in the middle of the night
84-2_367.183_3.063.wav_ASR	and the morning my wife could not get home to me
84-2_370.723_2.645.wav_ASR	so we have a conference who came up and found me
84-2_373.648_1.7.wav_ASR	and they took me to the hospital
84-2_375.668_2.58.wav_ASR	that's when i spent about eight days in the hospital
84-2_378.928_4.34.wav_ASR	because because i was driving convoy
84-2_383.468_2.537.wav_ASR	so i really didn't see anybody there
84-2_386.828_5.56.wav_ASR	and i had it was difficult for me because i felt felt my talking was not great
84-2_392.4_3.057.wav_ASR	and also it was just difficult for me
84-2_395.58_4.82.wav_ASR	so it was i mean i must have watched tv
84-2_400.74_2.02.wav_ASR	and he i was in a room by myself
84-2_402.991_12.52.wav_ASR	and apparently on a monday night the about a week and a couple days later i went to mba which is only about six blocks away
84-2_415.551_0.838.wav_ASR	it was pretty close
84-2_416.971_3.157.wav_ASR	so that's when i stayed for two months
84-2_430.74_2.047.wav_ASR	oh i've done a lot of things to try to get better
84-2_433.0_1.662.wav_ASR	yeah i don't know if all that works but
84-2_435.24_3.841.wav_ASR	so i was in the hospital for for eight weeks
84-2_439.239_9.64.wav_ASR	and every day except the weekends i had o t and p t
84-2_449.599_1.36.wav_ASR	and then i also had speech
84-2_451.039_1.499.wav_ASR	that was quickly in the morning
84-2_453.139_4.394.wav_ASR	and then in the afternoon i for awhile i didn't do anything
84-2_457.533_3.458.wav_ASR	but then eventually i started going to art
84-2_461.433_4.9.wav_ASR	and i i i did some stuff but it wasn't really very good
84-2_467.093_6.865.wav_ASR	and i thought by the time i left there i wasn't so sure i was gonna do it
84-2_474.15_7.18.wav_ASR	so i tried it a little bit more at magi which is where i go for outpouring
84-2_481.83_0.958.wav_ASR	and it wasn't great
84-2_483.11_2.78.wav_ASR	soon they introduced a music program
84-2_486.65_2.184.wav_ASR	and i was always interested in singing
84-2_489.35_2.38.wav_ASR	but i don't sing a lot
84-2_491.79_3.961.wav_ASR	and i'm afraid i don't always sing on key
84-2_496.23_1.816.wav_ASR	oh i thought it might be good
84-2_498.25_2.78.wav_ASR	so i took some singing lessons which i still take
84-2_501.63_4.7.wav_ASR	and then also at temple there's an aphasia program
84-2_506.586_10.4.wav_ASR	and so there's a singing program there which i think better because i get real songs instead of made up songs at magi
84-2_517.118_19.5.wav_ASR	and we're on something called intercept where we try to do stuff to help people learn about aphasia and see how we can help other people who have aphasia
84-2_563.78_6.71.wav_ASR	well i have a lot of good experiences because i've had a pretty positive life
84-2_570.49_11.14.wav_ASR	up until first grade i went to school in a suburb of cleburna of cleburna high school
84-2_582.166_13.72.wav_ASR	and then between my first and second grade years i moved to chicago and was in a really nice suburb there called whippin
84-2_596.144_6.909.wav_ASR	and so growing up i i i was participating in a lot of different things
84-2_603.184_3.92.wav_ASR	but i was not a great athlete but i was an okay enough athlete
84-2_607.264_4.74.wav_ASR	so i usually make the last play on the team
84-2_612.29_4.45.wav_ASR	and i really like playing hockey which we did outdoors at the time
84-2_617.81_12.14.wav_ASR	and so i would say i learned a lot of experience from hockey just about the game and how to set up different play
84-2_630.86_17.583.wav_ASR	and eventually eventually when i was in my what's called the banquet which is fourteen and fifteen i was made captain of the team
84-2_648.56_1.971.wav_ASR	that was a really nice outdoor for me
84-2_650.531_4.636.wav_ASR	and it was a good time for me
84-2_655.371_2.836.wav_ASR	my i was on the p t i was not on the t m
84-2_658.411_5.549.wav_ASR	but but there's enough players on the team that i was pretty friendly with
84-2_664.191_1.68.wav_ASR	and all of them were fun to watch
84-2_666.031_2.66.wav_ASR	so it was overnight in northfield
84-2_668.951_1.04.wav_ASR	he's in the neighbor's yard
84-2_670.145_2.671.wav_ASR	so it was really nice to meet all the people
84-2_673.365_10.54.wav_ASR	and we would have games basically from lake forest and from lake county to cook
84-2_684.865_2.36.wav_ASR	so it was just nice to get to know some people
84-2_693.81_2.2.wav_ASR	and i did get her by herself
84-2_696.361_5.44.wav_ASR	and i broke my color bar
84-2_706.07_1.072.wav_ASR	it wasn't that bad
84-2_710.85_1.037.wav_ASR	it it can be
84-2_712.13_2.397.wav_ASR	but it wasn't bad for him
84-2_714.67_2.22.wav_ASR	maybe it wasn't a particular bad
84-2_717.63_4.6.wav_ASR	but i remember i came home and i still wasn't feeling great
84-2_722.231_11.86.wav_ASR	so my dad took me to what was then called evanston hospital which is now part of northwestern medical center from down
84-2_735.0_4.82.wav_ASR	and so i remember i did some exercises and some other things
84-2_740.071_1.66.wav_ASR	and they said i had a broken collar
84-2_741.98_7.66.wav_ASR	so i i i think it you know i i actually broke my colorblind
84-2_751.48_1.24.wav_ASR	maybe it was only once
84-2_753.1_1.699.wav_ASR	and then i also broke my wrist
84-2_755.56_1.969.wav_ASR	but i can't remember exactly how he did that
84-2_765.892_4.149.wav_ASR	yeah you you can't have a cat on that
84-2_776.028_1.013.wav_ASR	the end
84-2_777.152_1.08.wav_ASR	you play it
84-2_781.243_1.08.wav_ASR	oh well
84-2_785.063_2.76.wav_ASR	so did did you do that in college too
84-2_797.763_0.72.wav_ASR	oh good
84-2_845.89_2.26.wav_ASR	oh yes that's the same thing we saw last
84-2_858.01_2.94.wav_ASR	so it's the story of a young man
84-2_861.0_5.48.wav_ASR	he'd say he's around twelve years old kicking a soccer ball
84-2_867.26_13.14.wav_ASR	and i guess one of the air force kits went through a plate glass window and landed next to someone who was probably either reading or maybe watching tv
84-2_880.69_3.33.wav_ASR	and so he saw the ball coming at him
84-2_884.43_10.34.wav_ASR	and he he noticed that a lamp had come a lamp had come to rest on beside him
84-2_895.09_3.248.wav_ASR	and i could see the ball coming at him
84-2_898.338_2.865.wav_ASR	so he might have caught the ball
84-2_902.03_2.001.wav_ASR	and then he wasn't sure what to do
84-2_904.138_2.02.wav_ASR	so he saw that the glass was broken
84-2_906.678_4.26.wav_ASR	so he went over to the window to see what had happened
84-2_911.418_4.592.wav_ASR	and i'm assuming that he saw the person who kicked the soccer ball
84-2_916.01_6.4.wav_ASR	but the then perhaps but by then perhaps the person with the soccer ball had run away
84-2_930.177_7.24.wav_ASR	so it's the story of a young boy who was on his way to school
84-2_938.237_5.22.wav_ASR	and he wasn't sure that he needed an umbrella
84-2_943.61_7.119.wav_ASR	so he decided that he wouldn't take an umbrella because it maybe didn't look like it was gonna rain
84-2_951.25_5.94.wav_ASR	but as soon as she stepped outside and started walking a little bit the rain came down
84-2_957.89_1.84.wav_ASR	so he went back to his house
84-2_959.73_4.444.wav_ASR	and i he was all wet
84-2_964.39_3.26.wav_ASR	and his mother had a strong look on her face
84-2_967.95_1.755.wav_ASR	but there was nothing he could do
84-2_969.89_4.927.wav_ASR	so he got some new clothes and went back out into the rain
84-2_975.35_1.92.wav_ASR	but this time he had an umbrella
84-2_988.79_6.25.wav_ASR	three this is the picture of a young lady who had a cat stuck up in a tree
84-2_995.279_8.66.wav_ASR	so he got off his tricycle and saw i think what must have been his dad
84-2_1004.61_2.312.wav_ASR	his dad climbed up the tree
84-2_1007.139_3.56.wav_ASR	then the ladder broke and fell to the ground
84-2_1011.04_7.14.wav_ASR	there's a a puppy who's trying to see if maybe the man or the could come down
84-2_1018.34_18.709.wav_ASR	but he he was up there and needed to be rescued by the fire department who came over and was going to get the father down and was going to get the cat down
84-2_1188.82_0.522.wav_ASR	oh yeah
84-2_1190.29_11.04.wav_ASR	well so this is a story about cinderella and her two i think they were probably stepdaughters and her old
84-2_1202.87_5.93.wav_ASR	so i believe that cinderella needed some help
84-2_1208.85_10.08.wav_ASR	and since she was able to get a job with the two stepsisters and the stepmother
84-2_1219.6_12.86.wav_ASR	and she was doing a lot of stuff like washing the clothes and cleaning the floors and doing stuff like that and probably also doing the laundry
84-2_1233.61_13.66.wav_ASR	then it came to pass that there was a prince who lived in the castle with his father and mother and perhaps some sisters and brothers
84-2_1247.87_7.51.wav_ASR	and he he was looking for somebody to fall in love with
84-2_1255.91_10.09.wav_ASR	so they everybody in the town got an invitation to this big party that they were gonna have
84-2_1266.0_7.976.wav_ASR	so the two stepsisters dress up and fine clothes and the mother went with them
84-2_1273.976_12.38.wav_ASR	and they were they went to the the prince the king was looking for cinderella
84-2_1286.996_3.0.wav_ASR	and so he he decided to have this party
84-2_1290.119_5.02.wav_ASR	and so they were at the party
84-2_1295.299_12.78.wav_ASR	and then a fairy godmother came along and said to the young woman that cinderella should go to the party too
84-2_1308.226_9.88.wav_ASR	so she she was able to get a dress and some nice clothing including a some beautiful shoes
84-2_1319.006_8.0.wav_ASR	and they they they were involved to the wedding
84-2_1327.231_10.9.wav_ASR	and they came to the wedding in a special chariot which had a rider and i think of someone who was in the back
84-2_1338.211_7.36.wav_ASR	and they came out at the party
84-2_1345.673_6.279.wav_ASR	and the the the prince was there
84-2_1352.133_2.54.wav_ASR	and the prince saw cinderella
84-2_1355.293_3.02.wav_ASR	and they had a very good time
84-2_1358.335_10.88.wav_ASR	but the the the cinderella had been told that she needed to be home by midnight
84-2_1370.035_5.014.wav_ASR	so as the clock struck twelve she knew she hadta get out
84-2_1375.049_3.707.wav_ASR	so he left and left the prince there
84-2_1378.756_17.48.wav_ASR	and as he went out to the carriage the princess cinderella turned back into a like a servant
84-2_1396.299_11.02.wav_ASR	and the prince prince was really upset about what had happened
84-2_1407.593_17.28.wav_ASR	so he he's some people from his his some people from his castle to go out and see if they could find
84-2_1425.678_6.62.wav_ASR	and so he went to different houses and could not find anybody
84-2_1432.618_11.82.wav_ASR	when he went to the house where the two stepsisters live she was wondering to know if anybody else was there
84-2_1444.93_13.02.wav_ASR	and somehow i think maybe he figured out that the the young lady who was cinderella was in the other room
84-2_1458.25_1.72.wav_ASR	so he brought out cinderella
84-2_1460.57_2.92.wav_ASR	and the shoes fit
84-2_1463.42_8.56.wav_ASR	so he went back to the prince and told him about this person
84-2_1472.66_6.16.wav_ASR	and eventually the person became close again with the prince
84-2_1480.57_3.74.wav_ASR	and and in the end the prince and cinderella got married
84-2_1514.01_3.94.wav_ASR	you don't remember what i talked about last week
84-2_1518.63_6.689.wav_ASR	so there was always a clock in my house growing up
84-2_1526.11_3.865.wav_ASR	and so i i knew pretty easily what time it was
84-2_1530.23_1.698.wav_ASR	oh i think i know the story
84-2_1531.9_8.72.wav_ASR	and so i remember especially in high school that there wasn't really any time i hadta be home
84-2_1541.12_5.3.wav_ASR	so my parents said that you know whenever you get home it's fine
84-2_1546.84_4.825.wav_ASR	you know obviously not too late but you you wanna have a good time
84-2_1551.665_5.02.wav_ASR	so especially on friday and saturday nights we useta go out
84-2_1556.735_4.043.wav_ASR	you used to drink beer in one of my friends' basement and then go out
84-2_1561.105_4.17.wav_ASR	and so we would go to different parties which was a lot fun
84-2_1565.275_7.34.wav_ASR	but i always made it home except one time i actually fell asleep at the wheel
84-2_1573.075_7.54.wav_ASR	but i was driving
84-2_1580.922_5.48.wav_ASR	one of my friends who was named firstnamet was in the other
84-2_1587.065_3.064.wav_ASR	and he he yelled at me
84-2_1590.202_0.83.wav_ASR	and i woke up
84-2_1591.802_1.28.wav_ASR	and it was it stop like
84-2_1593.302_0.94.wav_ASR	so nothing happened
84-2_1594.562_1.16.wav_ASR	and i was pretty lucky
84-2_1595.743_6.552.wav_ASR	so i guess it it's just good to know that a clock is always there knowing what time it is
84-2_1602.295_18.18.wav_ASR	and hopefully you know i i i then when i was in college i useta i dated a couple different girls where i was from in in washington kentuckh and in
84-2_1621.213_5.323.wav_ASR	and so i had a job that started at six o'clock in the morning during the summer
84-2_1626.636_8.781.wav_ASR	so i useta stay out with my friends or at my girlfriend's house until about four in the morning and then go go to work
84-2_1635.473_3.123.wav_ASR	or i would come home and get my bike and then go to work
84-2_1638.596_3.3.wav_ASR	so it was fun but it was also pretty awesome
84-2_1661.747_12.78.wav_ASR	the only thing i can say about birds is that growing up i pretty much took birds for granted
84-2_1674.744_11.46.wav_ASR	and i remember even when i was in undergrad and when i went to los angeles i i mean i never really thought about birth
84-2_1686.85_16.941.wav_ASR	but as i started to get well i i i i guess i should say that i worked a lot in when i was a lawyer
84-2_1703.791_4.937.wav_ASR	and then i went to a company where i was for a long time
84-2_1709.271_8.12.wav_ASR	but now that i'm looking for stuff to do one of the things i'm pretty interested in doing is birdwatching
84-2_1718.071_2.377.wav_ASR	so it's something i'm gonna try to do
84-2_1720.448_13.26.wav_ASR	and i i'm sure i told you but maybe maybe i didn't that my that me and my wife are gonna move to south carolina and in a community there where i feel i can do some birdwatching
84-2_1734.128_1.611.wav_ASR	so i like to try it
84-2_1735.948_1.252.wav_ASR	oh i hope i'm good at it
84-2_1737.348_1.265.wav_ASR	oh well i know what i'm doing
84-2_1738.613_8.402.wav_ASR	but it's important for me to find some hobbies that i can work on and try to get feel good about
84-2_1751.233_2.428.wav_ASR	oh oh we've already picked the place
84-2_1753.973_1.755.wav_ASR	umbrella umbrella
84-2_1755.813_0.848.wav_ASR	they've been there
84-2_1757.804_3.6.wav_ASR	and it's off the coast of
84-2_1763.495_4.149.wav_ASR	about forty minutes from the charleston airport
84-2_1768.604_1.36.wav_ASR	and it's beautiful
84-2_1772.244_3.34.wav_ASR	oh i don't wanna go into too much depth
84-2_1775.781_12.445.wav_ASR	but we we are constructing a place there that's part of a condominium that's right on the beach
84-2_1788.901_5.343.wav_ASR	and so so i my wife is down there right now
84-2_1794.244_5.8.wav_ASR	well she was so she could actually go into the building which is being constructed
84-2_1800.532_16.3.wav_ASR	and and she was able to tell me that from my from where are common is place my wife says that she can actually see the beach you know for the ocean
84-2_1817.192_13.006.wav_ASR	so for me that was really nice because i've always i useta have a place in ocean marine which my wife really liked that i didn't like so much
84-2_1830.198_1.1.wav_ASR	it's laid on the water
84-2_1831.912_4.94.wav_ASR	and so now i feel that i've been able to give something you know
84-2_1837.124_5.433.wav_ASR	some i wanted to find the place that would be good for her
84-2_1843.004_3.038.wav_ASR	and i mean it's gonna be a little hot for me
84-2_1846.364_6.04.wav_ASR	but i think it's gonna be worth it because it's gonna be a great place for my wife
84-2_1861.804_4.88.wav_ASR	it's it's in south carolina or north carolina
84-2_1868.964_0.303.wav_ASR	alright
84-2_1877.712_1.04.wav_ASR	well it's pretty certain
84-2_1879.112_1.64.wav_ASR	and i'm not very concerned so
84-2_1882.912_1.763.wav_ASR	but i think it should be good
84-2_1885.012_4.164.wav_ASR	and we know some people down there who live there
84-2_1889.212_1.86.wav_ASR	so that's gonna be really helpful too
84-2_1891.217_9.274.wav_ASR	but the person i know really well made a fortune in in a company that he was in
84-2_1900.657_4.7.wav_ASR	so he has a lot a lot of places now all over the world including kootenay
84-2_1929.085_7.92.wav_ASR	well probably the hotel i stayed in some nice hotel
84-2_1937.925_5.3.wav_ASR	but probably the nicest hotel i stayed in was for my wedding
84-2_1943.216_11.64.wav_ASR	and i married a a lot student when i was in college who lived in washington dc
84-2_1955.736_3.62.wav_ASR	so we got married at the four seasons hotel in georgia
84-2_1960.256_1.29.wav_ASR	and that was a real nice place
84-2_1961.546_2.702.wav_ASR	we we were able to be there for a couple days
84-2_1964.566_2.56.wav_ASR	we had a fair amount of people at our wedding
84-2_1967.137_1.529.wav_ASR	they think it was about two hundred
84-2_1969.686_5.86.wav_ASR	and we were able to have a wedding on a sunny day after
84-2_1976.586_2.56.wav_ASR	and we had a nice lunch
84-2_1979.209_12.504.wav_ASR	and then i remember that many of my friends went down to a bar further down in georgia town and with my wife and some friends and had a nice evening there
84-2_1992.089_1.731.wav_ASR	so for me it was a good place
84-2_1994.369_2.18.wav_ASR	but true i like being home
84-2_1996.549_3.359.wav_ASR	so i you know i did it
84-2_1999.989_0.545.wav_ASR	it was good
84-2_2000.709_3.348.wav_ASR	you know i like being where i am now
84-2_2196.154_4.351.wav_ASR	well i think i told you about my favorite restaurant in new york right there
84-2_2200.505_1.925.wav_ASR	one that i went to for about twenty years
84-2_2204.4_1.8.wav_ASR	oh i won't talk about that
84-2_2206.653_12.64.wav_ASR	well here in philadelphia i've gotten to know a few restaurants
84-2_2219.853_5.936.wav_ASR	because i lived here when i first took a job
84-2_2225.789_3.92.wav_ASR	oh i was a lot club for a journey in philadelphia
84-2_2230.669_3.36.wav_ASR	and then i lived here for awhile before i moved to princeton
84-2_2234.197_14.716.wav_ASR	but one of the places i like to eat a lot is gone up in price a little bit is a restaurant called park plaza
84-2_2249.537_1.139.wav_ASR	and i don't know if i told you
84-2_2250.676_4.494.wav_ASR	but i useta be able to speak french pretty well
84-2_2255.756_5.814.wav_ASR	and i like going there because they have a lot of good food
84-2_2262.196_5.2.wav_ASR	most of which is again too it's gotten to be overpriced so many restaurants
84-2_2267.49_9.604.wav_ASR	but one thing i really like there is my my they have a hamburger that's really nice
84-2_2277.79_5.42.wav_ASR	and it's and it it can be cooked different ways
84-2_2283.415_9.06.wav_ASR	and i like my meet very very not cook not completely cook but cook most of the way
84-2_2293.155_8.88.wav_ASR	it's a really nice place to get a juicy burger and either salad or some some french
84-2_2302.33_4.163.wav_ASR	but the prince i usually for my wife
84-2_2307.01_2.4.wav_ASR	so i usually write up getting a
84-2_2309.77_7.26.wav_ASR	but sometimes she makes me order the the the
84-2_2336.29_0.91.wav_ASR	oh we had this two
84-2_2337.64_6.1.wav_ASR	well the peanut butter and jelly sandwich for me is pretty easy to make
84-2_2344.78_4.14.wav_ASR	go to the most of my bread is in the freezer
84-2_2349.56_2.46.wav_ASR	so i take out two pieces of bread
84-2_2352.03_13.906.wav_ASR	one i like a particular kind of peanut butter that is made at costa which has nothing but peanuts in it
84-2_2365.936_10.164.wav_ASR	and so i usually put when i have a peanut butter and butter jelly sandwich which lately has been occurring a little more frequently for some reason i don't know
84-2_2376.676_2.695.wav_ASR	and then i'll take just about any jelly
84-2_2379.371_10.336.wav_ASR	but i've found a jelly at i think at wednesday that has three different types of fruit in it
84-2_2389.5_27.09.wav_ASR	and so i put that with some with some with the peanut butter on a bread that is a a type of wheat bread that i find to be to be very good
84-2_2416.69_4.042.wav_ASR	so i i'm gonna have a sandwich a little later today
84-2_2420.83_1.92.wav_ASR	and i'm probably gonna have a turkey sandwich
84-2_2423.13_2.155.wav_ASR	but yeah i like peanut butter and jelly a lot
84-2_2425.63_8.46.wav_ASR	the i've got the sandwich down to a side
84-2_2440.382_15.965.wav_ASR	well we i think i may have told you that we useta live in an apartment that we own across the hall
84-2_2456.416_4.325.wav_ASR	but we found somebody that we thought we could sell it to
84-2_2460.976_7.3.wav_ASR	and it turned out that he the two of them bought it at a price that i think was pretty good
84-2_2468.485_11.2.wav_ASR	so while we were waiting for the place to be built in korea we moved it across the hall where there's a rental unit
84-2_2479.5_13.0.wav_ASR	so and there's a washer and a dryer with with all the
84-2_2493.08_0.68.wav_ASR	the roads
84-2_2494.18_4.5.wav_ASR	all the locations i guess you could say have a washer and a dryer
84-2_2499.03_7.61.wav_ASR	so usually there may be a couple pieces of clothes that may go to the washing
84-2_2506.81_8.7.wav_ASR	but for the most part i will open the umbrella
84-2_2516.541_5.6.wav_ASR	it's a washer that works it it opens from the side
84-2_2522.721_4.203.wav_ASR	so i've put all the clothes in which something i'm still able to do
84-2_2527.541_5.5.wav_ASR	and then i will turn on the wash
84-2_2533.721_1.86.wav_ASR	usually it's on a cold side
84-2_2535.923_4.6.wav_ASR	and once it starts moving a little bit i put in the detergent
84-2_2541.603_5.972.wav_ASR	and for some reason this this washer takes a long time
84-2_2548.263_2.18.wav_ASR	but in about an hour it's done
84-2_2550.963_2.58.wav_ASR	and the clothes have always come up pretty clean
84-2_2553.677_3.5.wav_ASR	so i then put them in the
84-2_2558.157_3.06.wav_ASR	and that's about another forty five minutes
84-2_2561.777_10.454.wav_ASR	but usually within two hours the clothes come out and they're ready to be folded which for me takes awhile because i only have the one hand
84-2_2572.231_6.68.wav_ASR	so what i've tried to do is just limit the stuff that goes in my closet
84-2_2579.691_1.311.wav_ASR	and lord's at her own
84-2_2582.091_6.46.wav_ASR	yeah she she her clothes get washed with mine but i can't really put them away
84-2_2588.911_1.977.wav_ASR	and she's got a lot more clothing than i do
84-2_2605.921_5.7.wav_ASR	well i i grew up with a lot of flowers
84-2_2612.441_6.897.wav_ASR	but somehow when i married firstnamel that was not one of the things that she was really interested in
84-2_2619.338_7.26.wav_ASR	so we we have a few not a lot of fake flowers around our apartment
84-2_2627.098_3.1.wav_ASR	but i had a birthday in march
84-2_2630.778_6.74.wav_ASR	and one of the people i become very close with is a personal trainer named firstnamej
84-2_2637.618_7.84.wav_ASR	and so firstnamej has been with me for i think now for about two and a half years
84-2_2645.678_7.36.wav_ASR	and she got a small plot for me that is the only living plant in this area
84-2_2654.178_0.9.wav_ASR	and for some reason
84-2_2655.359_3.54.wav_ASR	but i got it at the end of
84-2_2661.499_3.353.wav_ASR	and for some reason the plan is still chucking along
84-2_2664.959_0.989.wav_ASR	it's doing pretty well
84-2_2666.159_8.647.wav_ASR	so i feel good that i can keep a plan now for four months
84-2_2681.403_5.463.wav_ASR	and i think the biggest success is is that i don't hafta worry it very much
84-2_2689.146_3.773.wav_ASR	but i can show it to you but i don't know what it is
84-2_2692.919_6.577.wav_ASR	maybe at the end if we have enough time we see if i can see
84-2_2699.679_5.76.wav_ASR	but it's just it's just hard for me to see because it's on the window over there
84-2_2707.71_1.15.wav_ASR	you're gonna plan it

63-2_606.497_1.25.wav_ASR	couldn't get the dog
63-2_608.377_9.35.wav_ASR	he went with the firemen who got her out and got everything back to normal
63-2_1440.511_0.74.wav_ASR	okay
63-2_1441.268_16.0.wav_ASR	when the grandmother and her two sons were small they brought in cinderella to clean up the house
63-2_1458.806_6.78.wav_ASR	and cinderella did all the work

65-1_104.608_1.57.wav_ASR	oh i don't know
65-1_107.092_0.66.wav_ASR	that's the wrong word
65-1_107.8_10.32.wav_ASR	it was very very troubling because really trouble because didn't know where i was
65-1_119.162_6.17.wav_ASR	and they were visitors in the hospital room
65-1_125.543_3.84.wav_ASR	and these guys were saying they they the visit
65-1_129.431_3.17.wav_ASR	and i knew who they were these people
65-1_132.616_1.52.wav_ASR	but they're lots lots of them
65-1_134.184_1.5.wav_ASR	they didn't know where i was
65-1_136.291_2.12.wav_ASR	there were lots of people visiting me
65-1_138.802_1.63.wav_ASR	and and there's several amazing
65-1_141.127_1.76.wav_ASR	oh when when it's his boy's gonna come back
65-1_143.169_1.03.wav_ASR	when his voice gonna come back
65-1_145.808_1.58.wav_ASR	oh i thought i was perfectly fine
65-1_148.727_11.07.wav_ASR	and but what i didn't know was that the had spent ten days with a breathing tube popped down my throat in a coma
65-1_160.403_2.47.wav_ASR	and then look like it was gonna come out right
65-1_162.888_1.7.wav_ASR	and they gave me a tricycle
65-1_165.547_13.33.wav_ASR	and and so the the what turned out to be scrubs toxic and cocaine changes my voice pretty radically where my wife had hadta told me
65-1_178.901_7.83.wav_ASR	and she said that the i said that you you you had the baby
65-1_190.21_0.31.wav_ASR	that's it
65-1_190.701_1.11.wav_ASR	actually there were
65-1_191.914_1.46.wav_ASR	the one thing like that me
65-1_193.584_0.55.wav_ASR	and that was gone
65-1_194.184_7.67.wav_ASR	so but that was important to me because i i i didn't know where i was
65-1_202.556_3.45.wav_ASR	my people's recommendations recommended the same
65-1_206.835_1.36.wav_ASR	when when his wife's gonna come back
65-1_208.855_1.99.wav_ASR	and i was really really struggling
65-1_211.097_0.7.wav_ASR	really trouble
65-1_214.441_2.34.wav_ASR	that was one of the first of my memories
65-1_227.068_4.71.wav_ASR	well it's what what ended up being was at the
65-1_232.093_9.72.wav_ASR	and terms of my brain injury if you will certain things kinda stand out and were important to me
65-1_242.008_14.18.wav_ASR	and it just when when i hafta get focus on something i didn't particularly understand or or or improve of i get get
65-1_256.236_2.98.wav_ASR	it was extraordinary angry
65-1_261.478_2.001.wav_ASR	and did never ever like them
65-1_264.808_2.63.wav_ASR	but just really angry
65-1_267.486_1.47.wav_ASR	and i kept on trying
65-1_268.978_5.53.wav_ASR	well it was very very very trouble really trouble for a a lot for for quite awhile
65-1_291.425_2.81.wav_ASR	and and and i don't want you ever to relate to that
65-1_294.408_3.91.wav_ASR	oh i wouldn't wish it wasn't anybody
65-1_316.655_7.65.wav_ASR	the almost ninety nine years old most of what
65-1_324.396_0.55.wav_ASR	again
65-1_325.376_0.84.wav_ASR	and that's what he said
65-1_326.232_3.43.wav_ASR	it was just just just a reunion of friends but not really as separate
65-1_330.55_12.55.wav_ASR	but the eighty four instance was was most interesting because because an engineer for my company's involved by
65-1_343.181_6.64.wav_ASR	one i was on what they call the hip joint or hip joint meaning i had a wonderful career ahead of me
65-1_349.842_1.58.wav_ASR	he was gonna go four for our organization
65-1_352.182_4.66.wav_ASR	and and my one of my supervisors told me
65-1_356.862_0.89.wav_ASR	he was sposta do that
65-1_357.802_6.2.wav_ASR	it told me i was on the highway list which met again in my i was on the highway list which met again
65-1_364.136_1.18.wav_ASR	my car's laid out front of me
65-1_366.048_2.15.wav_ASR	there was nothing shopping for me
65-1_369.12_8.58.wav_ASR	and then after the eighty four instance personality change which i find out twenty years later in debmarc p t a
65-1_377.717_1.63.wav_ASR	where i find it twenty years later in denver
65-1_380.151_3.17.wav_ASR	and my son firstnamem
65-1_384.141_2.67.wav_ASR	three i was slow to comprehend things
65-1_387.869_5.87.wav_ASR	but finally did after taking taking taking more time for comprehension
65-1_393.757_7.06.wav_ASR	and and and i couldn't do my engineering job to to to suit me
65-1_401.669_1.51.wav_ASR	and i didn't didn't tell anybody that
65-1_403.668_0.89.wav_ASR	and i didn't enjoy anybody that much
65-1_404.612_0.8.wav_ASR	try i fake it
65-1_406.295_17.87.wav_ASR	and i fake it and spent my lunch hours for months by myself in a conference room the learning aspect of my job and not telling a not telling a story because i just
65-1_424.226_1.26.wav_ASR	it's before before eighty eight
65-1_426.413_1.47.wav_ASR	at eight nine eighty four again
65-1_428.188_2.09.wav_ASR	actually before the emergency of this disability
65-1_430.428_0.54.wav_ASR	eighty eight
65-1_432.046_2.46.wav_ASR	and and i was on on the accident night forty four
65-1_434.528_1.11.wav_ASR	but i don't on company business
65-1_436.8_5.82.wav_ASR	and i i just knew that that my ability to comprehend basic exercises of my job
65-1_443.288_1.95.wav_ASR	actually i just knew i was gonna get fired
65-1_445.562_0.85.wav_ASR	and i knew i was
65-1_447.165_8.14.wav_ASR	had three kids a wife spouse were just a lovely lovely lovely woman there home with the three kids
65-1_455.32_2.19.wav_ASR	and i was the king
65-1_458.431_2.45.wav_ASR	and i couldn't stand the thought of being fire
65-1_461.855_5.49.wav_ASR	and and then so i'd say did everything i could to relearn my job
65-1_467.981_7.74.wav_ASR	but it did take me probably a couple three years to figure out that that i was no longer on on the fast track
65-1_476.146_1.08.wav_ASR	and no no one
65-1_477.247_2.36.wav_ASR	it wasn't it wasn't obvious to her
65-1_479.684_3.22.wav_ASR	but i it was no longer fast
65-1_482.928_9.4.wav_ASR	and and the biggest most difficult part of that was the short term memory difficulties
65-1_493.261_11.8.wav_ASR	and so i ended up with a franklin planner and would write down everything in there just to help my help my short term memory
65-1_506.11_10.319.wav_ASR	so it was largely the aphasia and and people seeing me differently at work
65-1_516.482_4.701.wav_ASR	and and of course i look back back back back on it a few years after that
65-1_521.2_2.859.wav_ASR	and and i did not deserve to be in the fast track
65-1_524.107_3.97.wav_ASR	well it it it was perfectly obvious everybody around me
65-1_528.092_0.72.wav_ASR	they weren't very nice to me
65-1_530.176_14.41.wav_ASR	and that the writing everything down was was the biggest assessment to me to help me do my job
65-1_567.07_6.54.wav_ASR	the basically it's the the
65-1_573.891_4.62.wav_ASR	three i i call it pre eighty four accident plus eighty four
65-1_579.419_5.17.wav_ASR	that's that's how my my life has been defined
65-1_585.51_11.37.wav_ASR	and i it's i that that is what i call my my declining moment or the the the decline in health
65-1_597.64_8.89.wav_ASR	because i've struggled with the aphasia obviously and memory issues ever since then
65-1_606.552_13.22.wav_ASR	and and i mean like for example the the the window of seventy six seventy seven was out of engineer's scope that proved
65-1_619.826_1.84.wav_ASR	he had a job in an apartment
65-1_621.855_7.67.wav_ASR	and the eight is economic viability i i i paid rent to my folks lived in the lived in their house
65-1_630.113_6.18.wav_ASR	and that weekend my dad and i put a obstacle field in a little small corner
65-1_637.015_3.44.wav_ASR	and it was quite a interesting interesting project
65-1_641.315_4.08.wav_ASR	and and interesting enough i can probably
65-1_645.41_8.3.wav_ASR	the the the engine had a rooster quacker four jiffy caron in it which had some difficulty
65-1_653.791_1.8.wav_ASR	and i could probably still today
65-1_655.869_1.58.wav_ASR	and this is nineteen seventy six hundred seven
65-1_658.288_2.76.wav_ASR	like probably still day they rebuild the corner building
65-1_662.6_3.89.wav_ASR	but but i but ask me what have you for supper last night
65-1_667.122_0.49.wav_ASR	can't talk
65-1_669.274_0.66.wav_ASR	so yeah
65-1_670.235_1.4.wav_ASR	short short memory loss
65-1_671.658_13.02.wav_ASR	but but then things from from from from long ago and do do do some something longer ago i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can i can
65-1_695.671_5.07.wav_ASR	oh no actually i was ended up like they pretty much are
65-1_701.591_4.64.wav_ASR	and and i got out of school the spring of seventy six
65-1_706.317_1.95.wav_ASR	had a job to come in switzerland
65-1_709.739_0.87.wav_ASR	they're in the naples
65-1_710.687_2.65.wav_ASR	and witch and witch no witch nor no longer exists
65-1_714.262_5.09.wav_ASR	but i was an engineering engineer at the shipbuilder
65-1_720.011_10.31.wav_ASR	and so so i i i my customers for what will we call it for a fort life forever and ever and ever
65-1_731.149_9.58.wav_ASR	the firemen one of the small four packs had a a cat
65-1_745.046_7.51.wav_ASR	and the severa a bl el fl fl el fl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl rl sl
65-1_753.154_4.14.wav_ASR	so i was already doing that kind of stuff as a job
65-1_758.166_6.91.wav_ASR	but then my my father found this this hard on an engine vehicle
65-1_765.797_12.68.wav_ASR	and it just happen to be that it was a project for heinrich to to build together that winter while while i was working in the ottoman empire's feed
65-1_778.497_8.96.wav_ASR	and and it it's kind of how i graduated
65-1_815.779_2.14.wav_ASR	it was a real slipper
65-1_818.492_4.39.wav_ASR	and the the hot car at the time was the the dots and two forty seven
65-1_823.884_3.99.wav_ASR	well it was at the first the dance in those jeez whiz
65-1_828.597_6.2.wav_ASR	and and then he useta from a stop light dress those guys off
65-1_835.141_6.83.wav_ASR	and they the the the other guys the the drivers at the dashs and ears cars couldn't figure out how to help his leg
65-1_842.229_5.21.wav_ASR	it it was a lot a lot fun seeing looks in our faces as it in my rehab
65-1_910.099_1.2.wav_ASR	oh okay
65-1_911.875_2.36.wav_ASR	the story is there's a young lad
65-1_914.589_8.46.wav_ASR	looks like maybe maybe ten year old at six square or seven grade the kicking a soccer ball
65-1_923.492_6.72.wav_ASR	and then an hour and a half later picks up the soccer ball through a house window
65-1_930.915_8.97.wav_ASR	and the soccer ball comes through the window and and lands on a a mile's lap in the house
65-1_940.813_7.32.wav_ASR	and the adult mall gets up holding the soccer ball and looks through the window and says trying to figure out what's going on
65-1_951.714_0.38.wav_ASR	they done
65-1_971.063_5.65.wav_ASR	looks like a young boy is leaving
65-1_976.736_2.88.wav_ASR	and as his mother says
65-1_979.897_1.4.wav_ASR	here's there's your umbrella
65-1_981.983_0.84.wav_ASR	and he said
65-1_983.049_1.03.wav_ASR	yeah i don't need that
65-1_984.13_4.77.wav_ASR	and then then he he leaves saying goodbye and everything
65-1_989.831_1.61.wav_ASR	and the mom's holding the umbrella
65-1_991.969_3.23.wav_ASR	and the the young lad is out and about walking around
65-1_995.914_1.2.wav_ASR	and it starts to rain
65-1_997.78_1.36.wav_ASR	and they're searching for her
65-1_999.75_0.79.wav_ASR	and he's running
65-1_1000.563_4.18.wav_ASR	and he gets back to his mom so soaked and wet
65-1_1005.358_0.87.wav_ASR	and he's not happy
65-1_1006.245_1.13.wav_ASR	they're they're nice she happy
65-1_1008.212_2.37.wav_ASR	and then he goes out finally with a umbrella
65-1_1010.631_3.09.wav_ASR	and and and it looks like all his wife
65-1_1027.309_5.9.wav_ASR	well the beginning it looks like a cat a cat had climbed up a tree
65-1_1034.269_3.46.wav_ASR	and being probably chased by a dog climb up the tree
65-1_1038.222_1.16.wav_ASR	had stuck up in the tree
65-1_1040.013_8.761.wav_ASR	the little girl who was probably her own grew up and then once her cat down
65-1_1049.333_10.48.wav_ASR	and looks like an adult male figure was like really her dad that climbed up the tree to get the cat and is and is and is and is and is and he's caught up there by this barking dog
65-1_1060.56_5.52.wav_ASR	also and now then there's also a a bird over the other side of the tree singing away
65-1_1066.533_11.02.wav_ASR	and it's also the fire department is running up with her ladder to try get down both the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the cat
65-1_1077.577_2.22.wav_ASR	that's that's the tree by the tree
65-1_1353.355_0.3.wav_ASR	yeah i think so
65-1_1353.835_5.45.wav_ASR	her mother had passed away
65-1_1360.127_2.77.wav_ASR	father remarried
65-1_1363.72_8.84.wav_ASR	and the wicked stepmother brought with her two two rather mean stepdaughters
65-1_1373.655_13.75.wav_ASR	and and and in their home life the cinderella's treated poorly by the stepmother and abused how way she say by the stepdaughters
65-1_1387.769_7.59.wav_ASR	and and oh just worked worked a lot
65-1_1395.968_9.9.wav_ASR	and then in the kingdom the king had a a a merry son
65-1_1406.524_19.39.wav_ASR	and one of his adventures side to have a ball to with invite all the eligible young ladies in the kingdom with the the the the getting the the the prince married off
65-1_1427.134_24.41.wav_ASR	and so cinderella with the help of the mice and their in the house set up a they really lovely gown for cinderella to go to to wear this ball
65-1_1451.694_17.08.wav_ASR	and and the stepmother was insulted on getting one of her her her daughters married off and and then so would not allow cinderella to go to the ball
65-1_1469.504_3.98.wav_ASR	her stepsisters went
65-1_1474.182_11.98.wav_ASR	and and a carriage was looked like a pumpkin and then mice went up but turned into horses
65-1_1486.874_8.89.wav_ASR	and they think that the the the horse from the house ended up as the the the pumpkin carriage
65-1_1496.594_3.35.wav_ASR	and she she hadta go to the ball
65-1_1499.966_5.76.wav_ASR	also the the prince danced right away with a cinderella
65-1_1506.4_12.64.wav_ASR	but the stepmother was she hadta be back by midnight because everything was gonna go back to the way it was at midnight
65-1_1519.217_1.04.wav_ASR	so he was
65-1_1520.273_3.71.wav_ASR	so she hurried out of there and left a glass slipper behind
65-1_1524.602_11.17.wav_ASR	and then after the the the prince says there's only one person interested in him
65-1_1535.789_2.93.wav_ASR	and it was the the gal that left the glass slipper behind
65-1_1538.769_9.72.wav_ASR	and and and so the the eyes were set right out the kingdom to try and figure out who was that the lady left the glass slipper behind
65-1_1549.451_11.43.wav_ASR	and and it was the the lady who's who's fit this this small slipper
65-1_1561.723_3.47.wav_ASR	and the stepsisters need one on fit the glass slipper
65-1_1565.701_3.72.wav_ASR	slippers foot would fit in the slipper
65-1_1569.443_7.35.wav_ASR	and so she was invited as the one that the prince wanted wanted to marry
65-1_1576.915_5.67.wav_ASR	and and so then the the cinderella hadta marry the prince
65-1_1582.609_2.0.wav_ASR	they lived happily ever after
65-1_1595.381_4.76.wav_ASR	preferably on on on wheat bread
65-1_1600.8_8.05.wav_ASR	he used a knife and and spread the spread the peanut butter on one side of the bread
65-1_1609.79_6.11.wav_ASR	but then the other side of the but other other other bread the official jelly is grape jelly
65-1_1617.339_1.5.wav_ASR	and then she take a spoon
65-1_1619.081_5.76.wav_ASR	now not knife because he he cut up the the the jelly and the and the jar
65-1_1624.893_6.9.wav_ASR	but you take your spoon and then spoon out the the grape grape jelly on the other piece of bread
65-1_1632.163_2.41.wav_ASR	use the knife spread it out
65-1_1634.597_2.32.wav_ASR	and then then put the two halves together
65-1_1636.935_3.5.wav_ASR	and he got the ultimate peanut butter and jelly sandwich
65-2_8.167_1.85.wav_ASR	speaks hard
65-2_10.563_0.77.wav_ASR	much improve
65-2_12.338_9.08.wav_ASR	the the holding of speech surgery for words occurs less than it did
65-2_22.185_23.08.wav_ASR	the what what happens is that the if i have an accident to tell a story or something like that i will may do it in the most best form and and then think later
65-2_45.514_1.3.wav_ASR	and i i should have said that
65-2_46.935_0.67.wav_ASR	could have said that
65-2_48.111_1.09.wav_ASR	why why didn't i say that
65-2_49.95_6.53.wav_ASR	for example in the trouble shooting audit of legislation if they're some i could definitely with a car
65-2_57.16_5.08.wav_ASR	it helps amazingly if i think about it for a about a day or so
65-2_62.323_26.47.wav_ASR	and and unless i see it before the the the the the the time spent analyzing and thinking about it and certainly all the different aspects of the problem technically a lot a lot a lot of the most of the the most important time is the is the most of the the the time spent analyzing and thinking about it and certainly all the different aspects of the problem technical a lot a lot a lot of the most important time is the the the time spent analyzing and thinking about it and certainly all the different aspects of the problem technical a lot a lot a lot of the most important time is the the the time spent analyzing and thinking about it and certainly all the different aspects of the problem technical a lot a lot a lot of the most important time is the the the time spent analyzing and thinking about it and certainly all the different aspects of the problem technical a lot a lot a lot of the most important time is the the the time spent analyzing and thinking about it and certainly all the different aspects of the problem technical a
65-2_89.557_8.62.wav_ASR	and i'll i'll and i'll get it have our own idea
65-2_98.79_1.57.wav_ASR	why didn't i think of that before
65-2_100.765_5.64.wav_ASR	if before before my eighty four action i would've thought of that immediately
65-2_107.061_5.26.wav_ASR	but it's much more difficult and and takes a longer than it did
65-2_112.37_1.84.wav_ASR	and that's it's like six
65-2_114.233_1.4.wav_ASR	been that way for thirty six years
65-2_127.18_6.21.wav_ASR	the first one was a where i was tibetan at an intersection
65-2_134.294_2.7.wav_ASR	and ended up being
65-2_137.011_6.39.wav_ASR	and i i caught the old annual harbor's boat in the driveway side door
65-2_144.01_12.54.wav_ASR	and it had a ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder ladder
65-2_157.19_1.61.wav_ASR	did i say punctual lunch
65-2_159.526_1.7.wav_ASR	seventy years old
65-2_161.937_1.51.wav_ASR	the three and the way in the car
65-2_164.72_6.62.wav_ASR	and in i in a coma for three and four weeks
65-2_172.132_7.28.wav_ASR	hospital probably probably about two and a half months
65-2_180.19_6.53.wav_ASR	and our third child was born three days after i was moved out of my apartment
65-2_190.003_8.12.wav_ASR	and the second one was february nineteen ninety nine
65-2_199.113_2.48.wav_ASR	it was a sharonville and philadelphia on the left side
65-2_202.563_6.32.wav_ASR	and and i believe that i was unconscious for
65-2_209.678_1.66.wav_ASR	well i guess i don't know how long
65-2_212.237_10.04.wav_ASR	but i recall walking across the street starting across across and seeing the corner panel of the car front me
65-2_223.056_2.51.wav_ASR	and then i had the sentence being spent around
65-2_226.386_7.17.wav_ASR	and then later like i say i i first i remember everything maybe
65-2_234.386_0.46.wav_ASR	five i don't know
65-2_234.865_0.96.wav_ASR	twenty minutes later
65-2_236.459_2.59.wav_ASR	and and i i was in a great meeting
65-2_239.878_5.52.wav_ASR	one i was in a wonderful room because the eighty four east last time i remember is five days before the accident
65-2_246.349_7.14.wav_ASR	and and this one in february nineteen ninety nine i knew exactly where i was as what i was doing and what happened
65-2_254.174_2.51.wav_ASR	and i i was in a really great meeting
65-2_257.551_13.19.wav_ASR	and then i say a brain injury because i think it was about to one day or two weeks later and i developed a a a little visit
65-2_271.809_19.88.wav_ASR	and i was that was the most except for extraordinary pain in the leg from from that the not knowing if the double vision would ever go away was most disturbing if the double vision would ever go away
65-2_292.55_3.94.wav_ASR	it did finally go way when the brain swelling went down
65-2_296.863_0.66.wav_ASR	finally we way
65-2_297.627_3.16.wav_ASR	and i i recall maybe three four or five
65-2_303.117_1.68.wav_ASR	the last day september about a time
65-2_305.602_7.65.wav_ASR	and and the doctors could not tell me whether the the difficulty would ever go away
65-2_313.306_5.33.wav_ASR	it was extraordinarily pleasant
65-2_318.652_8.33.wav_ASR	and i recall that the army guy that stuck a pen in my in my tibia said
65-2_327.006_12.71.wav_ASR	oh oh after after three or four months when when the all the finishes and the tape was started to heal he said
65-2_340.67_4.18.wav_ASR	oh boy you know that's probably the most painful injury known to man
65-2_345.576_0.85.wav_ASR	oh okay
65-2_346.527_1.96.wav_ASR	oh well it's me being a big baby then right
65-2_349.558_1.88.wav_ASR	and he he he
65-2_353.552_2.83.wav_ASR	that's kind of it
65-2_356.478_4.01.wav_ASR	that's the two at at top level
65-2_372.985_7.65.wav_ASR	oh west tenth going into my apartment
65-2_399.4_12.1.wav_ASR	the after the first eighty four inches when i did not know
65-2_411.553_17.22.wav_ASR	what what happened was at the eighty four lap tops were first adopted if you feel well by by by the company
65-2_429.508_17.32.wav_ASR	and and my my boss at that time sent brought one down for me to to
65-2_447.04_0.75.wav_ASR	oh i love it
65-2_449.397_1.27.wav_ASR	well say we were playing
65-2_450.939_2.51.wav_ASR	but learn how to use their their home
65-2_454.232_6.24.wav_ASR	and of course this is before the wedding eighty four and and those kind of things
65-2_460.758_11.03.wav_ASR	and i'd been doing a master's degree in which is nassau structural and algebra work for the company for quite a long time
65-2_472.499_9.05.wav_ASR	but that was all on i v m a a punk cards and kind of stuff or or a deck top computer
65-2_482.344_4.62.wav_ASR	and and so here's just a simple little laptop
65-2_486.979_1.14.wav_ASR	how do they know how to use it
65-2_488.329_4.44.wav_ASR	and and so they brought this my boss brought his lap top down
65-2_492.784_4.6.wav_ASR	and and in those years there was a a use of manual that came along with it
65-2_498.448_4.81.wav_ASR	and it tried to use a computer computer use a manual
65-2_503.994_7.47.wav_ASR	if you're read a a microsoft manual of any kind they are extraordinary difficult
65-2_512.342_14.661.wav_ASR	and one of the one thing in particular which was was was problem when they said to select something
65-2_528.184_0.51.wav_ASR	slipper
65-2_528.839_12.43.wav_ASR	well have you ever had any training in in a a a law enforcement what what did select me
65-2_542.262_6.07.wav_ASR	and and after several days of trying to figure out what select method
65-2_548.888_1.04.wav_ASR	there's well enough
65-2_550.399_0.6.wav_ASR	slip me
65-2_551.438_0.49.wav_ASR	aphasia
65-2_552.509_5.58.wav_ASR	as select what they met by selection i couldn't figure it out
65-2_558.551_0.56.wav_ASR	they couldn't
65-2_559.312_1.04.wav_ASR	there's no way
65-2_560.944_2.31.wav_ASR	importantly trouble really trouble by the boy
65-2_564.422_5.97.wav_ASR	and so so finally i called a coworker and said
65-2_570.608_3.88.wav_ASR	what what did they what does this mean i mean when they say select
65-2_575.568_7.44.wav_ASR	and it described the head top in the corner and move in a circle around the circle and hold the circle down and hold on
65-2_583.899_1.23.wav_ASR	that's what they met by luck
65-2_585.777_2.95.wav_ASR	well hell that was never described in the manual at all
65-2_589.857_3.86.wav_ASR	and that that threw me for a loop several times
65-2_594.838_7.3.wav_ASR	and so i i became became very questioning as to whether whether i could go back to work and even function at work
65-2_603.43_5.21.wav_ASR	and and so so finally the the they tape from the coworkers
65-2_609.025_0.57.wav_ASR	okay
65-2_609.645_8.98.wav_ASR	but it was most basic of terms which the the
65-2_619.047_2.1.wav_ASR	but i know that's it's drenched not mackinaw
65-2_621.166_1.3.wav_ASR	it was before my car's off the road exhausted
65-2_623.365_14.01.wav_ASR	his dog's mane it did not do not not company to somebody would but have the the gall and enough administrative enough to question them and ask them questions of them
65-2_638.605_1.01.wav_ASR	they did not
65-2_640.35_2.3.wav_ASR	the doctor did not describe that anywhere
65-2_643.738_14.19.wav_ASR	so so i went back to work and struggling with the aphasia and short term memory issues and the leg and and trying to to the the to the function
65-2_658.457_15.64.wav_ASR	and and finally my my after a couple years the company brought out what they're called the franklin plan and and said
65-2_675.07_5.2.wav_ASR	you might hafta take the facebook and then write stuff down
65-2_681.229_2.47.wav_ASR	and so well that was the guy's
65-2_684.72_2.15.wav_ASR	meanwhile being able to write write write things down
65-2_686.892_1.67.wav_ASR	so i i carry a small
65-2_689.233_0.96.wav_ASR	have with me right now
65-2_690.968_8.11.wav_ASR	still i carry small small notebook no not book wherever i go yeah today
65-2_699.671_10.58.wav_ASR	because that's that was i was writing when when my my boss told me i hadta write write stuff down with a french language
65-2_710.85_7.47.wav_ASR	all of a sudden that was new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and new and
65-2_719.266_2.66.wav_ASR	that that they're perfect
65-2_721.95_17.32.wav_ASR	and and also i ended up as a letter as a account manager for the company in the defense department meeting for the company shows shows the company's kind of stuff
65-2_739.905_10.88.wav_ASR	trips where i meet somebody new i will always say their name over and over and over again signed to myself
65-2_751.358_5.4.wav_ASR	use their name and any kind of verbal conversation with them
65-2_757.276_2.99.wav_ASR	use your name every time first to last name or or both
65-2_760.315_4.68.wav_ASR	and and then after after the conversation write their name down
65-2_766.354_8.45.wav_ASR	and and that's that's a a vital drop that i i still use today
65-2_775.921_2.94.wav_ASR	unfortunately i met a in our neighborhood met a
65-2_779.492_1.18.wav_ASR	oh i'm i'm at home now
65-2_781.203_0.98.wav_ASR	three not down the farm
65-2_782.926_11.55.wav_ASR	met a fellow and then the in the neighborhood out for a walk of several days ago and and he moved to the neighborhood some time back
65-2_794.526_1.25.wav_ASR	and i got his name
65-2_795.797_6.87.wav_ASR	and then said his name over and over again and the like and told my wife about it and then then wrote it down
65-2_803.378_7.6.wav_ASR	and this morning i saw him out for a walk and and couldn't recall his name at first but then i thought for awhile
65-2_810.996_1.51.wav_ASR	and then finally finally the name came to him
65-2_813.742_14.39.wav_ASR	so but but the the department on on recovering numbers is quite has been quite quite and invaluable to help me return to functional ability
65-2_839.375_0.52.wav_ASR	yes
65-2_840.697_4.78.wav_ASR	the i think i mentioned to you last week
65-2_846.085_1.32.wav_ASR	but maybe maybe
65-2_847.746_4.92.wav_ASR	time i spent the time as a volunteer at the rehab hospital in new york one or two three or four seven
65-2_853.54_6.13.wav_ASR	and because i started four oh four oh twenty eight years after the eighty fourth birthday
65-2_860.446_8.79.wav_ASR	and it became rather troublesome to me because having they just didn't do therapy for the brain and those years
65-2_869.993_1.69.wav_ASR	so they're no therapy
65-2_871.699_1.97.wav_ASR	you're able to survive
65-2_873.684_3.67.wav_ASR	but you're able to get discharge from hospital go home
65-2_878.184_5.53.wav_ASR	and because they just did not do therapy in those years
65-2_883.737_16.3.wav_ASR	and and over course the next twenty years oh white and i found out about from people at had therapy for brain injuries later that the divorce rate among the brain injuries later
65-2_901.056_3.61.wav_ASR	and the suzy side right hand to bring it in is four or five times heavier
65-2_905.719_4.72.wav_ASR	as what they're telling people even you know fifteen years ago
65-2_911.291_15.93.wav_ASR	and so i wanted to want to share that with patients that arearge of injuries just to give them hope that recovery is possible
65-2_928.404_1.38.wav_ASR	it years take a long time
65-2_930.61_10.94.wav_ASR	and in oh four when i started there archway it was i heard nurse nurses telling patients and their families
65-2_942.297_1.58.wav_ASR	oh a year and a half ago
65-2_944.156_1.01.wav_ASR	year and a half ago
65-2_945.302_0.94.wav_ASR	you're you're better and better and better and better
65-2_947.407_3.51.wav_ASR	hey you don't stop recovering
65-2_950.937_7.04.wav_ASR	the rat may be assidictic if you will and slow down pretty rapidly after a year or so
65-2_958.775_1.9.wav_ASR	you never never stop recovering
65-2_961.454_7.72.wav_ASR	and the eighteen eighty four incident i had a a a dead spot with no feeling above the left hand
65-2_970.136_2.65.wav_ASR	and there's just something that i experienced
65-2_972.842_1.73.wav_ASR	and there was like the pumpkin out there
65-2_974.655_0.98.wav_ASR	he no no big deal
65-2_975.956_3.16.wav_ASR	to stick a pen there man and wouldn't wouldn't wouldn't fit
65-2_979.96_1.4.wav_ASR	oh no no big deal
65-2_981.865_4.86.wav_ASR	and then it was probably maybe twenty twenty
65-2_987.413_0.4.wav_ASR	thank you
65-2_987.879_0.74.wav_ASR	he's oh no
65-2_989.309_5.7.wav_ASR	twenty five years after the eighty fourth birthday i was in the bedroom put on my socks one morning
65-2_996.424_4.47.wav_ASR	and i had feeling in the spot that had no feeling or twenty five years
65-2_1002.063_12.36.wav_ASR	so what i'm what i'm tell you actually is that the recovery may slow down significantly
65-2_1014.632_2.9.wav_ASR	but still they had never stopped recovery
65-2_1017.689_1.16.wav_ASR	you just don't stop recovering
65-2_1019.52_6.059.wav_ASR	yeah i don't practice
65-2_1068.805_3.42.wav_ASR	yes yeah it's not quite right
65-2_1072.242_7.48.wav_ASR	the time time time is the best you're alive in in those kinds of cases
65-2_1080.467_7.98.wav_ASR	because you you the feeling that you don't have it will lessen and it lessen important
65-2_1088.535_2.52.wav_ASR	and and you'll notice one day you know
65-2_1091.749_2.26.wav_ASR	grab i i i feel better and i didn't have that before
65-2_1094.551_1.56.wav_ASR	actually it will happen
65-2_1096.384_0.98.wav_ASR	you will experience that
65-2_1108.416_2.63.wav_ASR	actually i didn't know
65-2_1111.095_6.75.wav_ASR	it was it's me i was useta a little well feel a little like a little penrick everywhere once in awhile
65-2_1118.126_4.87.wav_ASR	but i i don't know if i got used to it or or or what
65-2_1124.138_3.5.wav_ASR	but like okay twenty five years later just put on the socks one more time
65-2_1128.17_0.83.wav_ASR	hey wait a minute
65-2_1129.343_1.05.wav_ASR	oh i got feeling there
65-2_1131.24_2.06.wav_ASR	and had had number before
65-2_1134.534_0.63.wav_ASR	oh well happy
65-2_1135.397_0.91.wav_ASR	have no idea
65-2_1149.083_1.64.wav_ASR	they well it will they were
65-2_1150.924_0.87.wav_ASR	the nurse was well working
65-2_1151.84_1.31.wav_ASR	and they they will ask
65-2_1153.17_0.46.wav_ASR	they well
65-2_1173.169_4.87.wav_ASR	went when i first first time i met my wife
65-2_1179.585_5.52.wav_ASR	when when i she and i first met we were high school graduates
65-2_1185.345_2.45.wav_ASR	the we went to different high schools together
65-2_1188.603_5.09.wav_ASR	her from but then near washing in the end
65-2_1193.708_1.47.wav_ASR	that myself from a plane flight
65-2_1195.197_4.75.wav_ASR	and it was before class started at purdue
65-2_1200.599_1.59.wav_ASR	august and nine thirty seventy two
65-2_1203.067_4.66.wav_ASR	it was her first day on campus
65-2_1208.447_1.29.wav_ASR	my first day in college
65-2_1210.419_10.65.wav_ASR	there was to be a dance at the this one night at
65-2_1221.089_2.26.wav_ASR	again each day are first first day in april
65-2_1224.373_5.17.wav_ASR	and and and and i was a little bit earlier
65-2_1229.596_7.78.wav_ASR	well i i will arrive place a little bit earlier given giving control of of the of the situation
65-2_1238.004_3.79.wav_ASR	and so i ended up being just a little bit earlier for the dance there
65-2_1242.551_5.71.wav_ASR	and and my wife and and her her wingman or
65-2_1248.927_1.99.wav_ASR	girl girl girl girl girl girl go with with buddy

65-2_1260.78_3.88.wav_ASR	and the and sandwich his wife was never met a stranger
65-2_1265.396_2.78.wav_ASR	they she's the a two extra
65-2_1268.95_2.08.wav_ASR	alright you look up in western exeter and say
65-2_1272.802_5.88.wav_ASR	but anyway so she and her her wing man walked up to me and
65-2_1278.901_2.74.wav_ASR	he is the the dance here
65-2_1281.66_2.44.wav_ASR	well i think so
65-2_1284.355_0.44.wav_ASR	most of the
65-2_1284.946_0.71.wav_ASR	that's why i went
65-2_1285.671_4.64.wav_ASR	and and we i hung around
65-2_1290.557_3.4.wav_ASR	and i i i i ran her that that that dance
65-2_1294.796_2.28.wav_ASR	and that's where we started dating
65-2_1297.1_3.94.wav_ASR	and and oh it's probably the three years old
65-2_1301.09_1.27.wav_ASR	they had around about three years so
65-2_1303.312_4.59.wav_ASR	and after about four years i figured out that well maybe something's going on here
65-2_1307.917_1.44.wav_ASR	and i gotta get more serious about this
65-2_1310.334_6.28.wav_ASR	so it's just i i i i use her of of picking me up at a at a school dance
65-2_1317.648_2.02.wav_ASR	that's where we were where we were first met as she picked me up at home
65-2_1359.514_5.59.wav_ASR	one a young boy looks like a soccer ball
65-2_1365.124_0.54.wav_ASR	oh okay
65-2_1366.388_2.61.wav_ASR	he he dances up going through the window
65-2_1369.723_9.4.wav_ASR	two a gentleman on a couch sitting right right beside right where the soccer ball comes through and knocks a lamp down and surprises him
65-2_1379.989_6.19.wav_ASR	and then he he he stands by the branch window trying to find out just to what went on
65-2_1402.182_12.63.wav_ASR	and the beginning this this mother it appears is cat has umbrella and wanted to give it to her son before he goes off to school or goes somewhere
65-2_1415.551_2.24.wav_ASR	and he's
65-2_1418.288_0.93.wav_ASR	he says no and says
65-2_1419.62_0.77.wav_ASR	oh no mommy needta
65-2_1421.306_1.08.wav_ASR	and then then leave
65-2_1422.451_2.41.wav_ASR	and then in the middle he starts raining on him
65-2_1425.438_1.43.wav_ASR	and then rain heavy on him
65-2_1426.933_7.19.wav_ASR	and then and then i he goes back home just as soaked to the bone and with mother kind of drowning
65-2_1434.453_6.25.wav_ASR	and then the last the end of the story was he learned his lesson and has the umbrella with him as walking in the rain
65-2_1455.01_13.73.wav_ASR	the way this started was that it looks like that there's a a a tree with a dog at the base of the tree a a a male at first tree limb
65-2_1469.12_2.18.wav_ASR	the dog's barking at this guy
65-2_1471.974_7.79.wav_ASR	and on the tree there's a cat with a girl down and a tricycle down below this cat
65-2_1480.206_6.04.wav_ASR	and it would appear that a cat climbed up the tree
65-2_1487.152_3.15.wav_ASR	the little girl's cat climbed up the tree and got stuck up there
65-2_1491.016_10.21.wav_ASR	they they male a man was either being chased up the tree by the dog or climb the tree to help the little guy's cat
65-2_1501.878_3.4.wav_ASR	it's also a firetruck and a fire engine
65-2_1506.838_1.32.wav_ASR	the firemen are carrying a ladder
65-2_1508.684_7.57.wav_ASR	and looks like the the the ladder is being used by the firemen to rescue either the the man or the cat
65-2_1517.004_11.24.wav_ASR	and and a songbird is over in the a a remote tree limb just singing away just enjoying the the old old story
65-2_1528.296_3.07.wav_ASR	yeah
65-2_1754.983_9.4.wav_ASR	and cinderella was a the daughter of of a kingdom who's
65-2_1764.522_2.45.wav_ASR	her mother had passed away
65-2_1767.818_1.36.wav_ASR	and father remarried
65-2_1769.925_8.29.wav_ASR	and the stepmother had two two daughters who were mean mean daughters
65-2_1778.914_21.3.wav_ASR	and as they after they were married the father and stepmother put cinderella around the place where the stepdaughters were were did did basically nothing
65-2_1801.139_8.38.wav_ASR	and so so cinderella spent her time working cleaning polishing the that kind of stuff around the house
65-2_1810.138_10.22.wav_ASR	and and in the kingdom there was a prince who was not married
65-2_1821.196_18.68.wav_ASR	and investigate to the king succeeded a a a ball be held with the the exercise exercise of introduce or get introducing the his son to the elderly young ladies in the kingdom
65-2_1840.902_3.19.wav_ASR	so the word's put out about the ball coming up
65-2_1844.858_6.3.wav_ASR	the cinderella was really happy about the ball coming coming up as were the stepsisters
65-2_1851.712_16.43.wav_ASR	and so the the the farm animals birds mice made a beautiful dress for cinderella for the ball
65-2_1868.918_10.26.wav_ASR	and and then at the last minute the stepmother told cinderella she was not going to the ball
65-2_1879.2_8.54.wav_ASR	and and also the the stepdaughters were really really really really really mean to her
65-2_1888.574_2.81.wav_ASR	and so so the stepdaughter went to the ball
65-2_1892.097_14.38.wav_ASR	and but in the meantime well before the ball they cinderella fairy godmother showed up and and said that well
65-2_1906.5_5.6.wav_ASR	and so it it made for her a lovely gown
65-2_1912.863_16.73.wav_ASR	and they turned a a pumpkin into a coach pulled by by mice i believe that were ended up turned into horses
65-2_1930.594_4.29.wav_ASR	and so then she went to go to the ball
65-2_1935.637_15.69.wav_ASR	and the prince was as quick as he went around with the stepsisters and and and only hit it off with cinderella
65-2_1951.795_2.29.wav_ASR	and up spending the night dancing with the cinderella
65-2_1954.409_7.13.wav_ASR	the her grandfather told cinderella that that he hafta be home home by midnight because this this all will end at midnight
65-2_1962.363_5.08.wav_ASR	and so the the the the prince and cinderella were dancing at midnight
65-2_1967.926_1.87.wav_ASR	and then then umbrella
65-2_1970.219_0.31.wav_ASR	oh no
65-2_1970.547_6.69.wav_ASR	and that runs runs out of the place leaving a glass slipper one glass slipper behind
65-2_1978.161_9.82.wav_ASR	and and as she's being driven back home the the coach turns back into a pumpkin
65-2_1988.0_2.49.wav_ASR	and the horse turned back into the mice
65-2_1990.617_5.26.wav_ASR	and the the footman come back in the horse and or or or dog
65-2_1996.13_0.56.wav_ASR	umbrella
65-2_1997.231_3.15.wav_ASR	and then so but still it was over
65-2_2000.401_10.91.wav_ASR	and and then after the ball the the prince decided that there's only the only this cinderella they were interested in
65-2_2012.653_3.04.wav_ASR	but nobody knew who used cinderella was and could not find her
65-2_2016.419_10.69.wav_ASR	and so he he put his eyes eye out to the task of trying to locate cinderella with the glass slipper that she left behind
65-2_2027.888_3.08.wav_ASR	and came to cinderella's house
65-2_2031.017_3.76.wav_ASR	the the slipper did not fit the the stepsisters
65-2_2035.46_4.69.wav_ASR	and then but but turned out it did fit fit fit cinderella
65-2_2041.079_9.609.wav_ASR	and so so it ended being that that cinderella and the prince got together and were married lived happily ever
65-2_2063.239_2.41.wav_ASR	we have two slices of bread
65-2_2066.402_6.391.wav_ASR	he hadta grease his peanut butter and jelly and have a knife for or spoon

tcu07a_70.9_3.37.wav_ASR	he was in his house pretty very long
tcu07a_74.315_1.24.wav_ASR	three he came
tcu07a_76.138_0.61.wav_ASR	he was there
tcu07a_77.528_4.12.wav_ASR	and and it's so funny
tcu07a_82.03_3.09.wav_ASR	and i kept myself in the end
tcu07a_85.47_2.96.wav_ASR	just enough to get the dog and
tcu07a_90.338_2.35.wav_ASR	in after i don't remember anything
tcu07a_94.397_1.61.wav_ASR	yeah and then i didn't
tcu07a_98.029_0.55.wav_ASR	yeah
tcu07a_98.865_9.01.wav_ASR	and and i don't know anything after that for two two
tcu07a_110.575_0.31.wav_ASR	yeah
tcu07a_111.612_4.26.wav_ASR	and then i i i no knew what was going on
tcu07a_116.162_2.63.wav_ASR	didn't understand what they
tcu07a_119.029_2.3.wav_ASR	oh man and i just didn't know what they were talking about
tcu07a_121.352_1.93.wav_ASR	they just you know
tcu07a_124.592_1.89.wav_ASR	yeah they i mean they didn't know anyway
tcu07a_126.5_10.94.wav_ASR	all these all these things were just one thing so i could talk to
tcu07a_137.758_1.3.wav_ASR	going there
tcu07a_139.078_3.58.wav_ASR	oh i just wouldn't need anything for me
tcu07a_142.674_1.05.wav_ASR	there were no
tcu07a_145.779_0.98.wav_ASR	and
tcu07a_147.708_0.39.wav_ASR	now
tcu07a_148.577_1.32.wav_ASR	it was all just
tcu07a_150.785_1.31.wav_ASR	oh no no
tcu07a_152.727_1.77.wav_ASR	and i don't know
tcu07a_154.514_1.02.wav_ASR	oh now i think about it
tcu07a_155.555_8.91.wav_ASR	but i don't know what i but maybe realize that i can't
tcu07a_165.334_0.61.wav_ASR	that don't remember
tcu07a_165.963_6.11.wav_ASR	you know i just know that i started totally staying you know going in and
tcu07a_172.235_1.75.wav_ASR	they started digging on me
tcu07a_174.0_3.31.wav_ASR	and i started slowly starting a little bit
tcu07a_178.01_2.7.wav_ASR	but they were a lot of things like my name
tcu07a_180.919_4.97.wav_ASR	just now you know my name
tcu07a_185.908_1.85.wav_ASR	it's and that was it you know
tcu07a_187.777_1.06.wav_ASR	and i they never get
tcu07a_189.134_2.56.wav_ASR	seven people they can get well that easy
tcu07a_192.031_0.89.wav_ASR	but me
tcu07a_200.296_0.34.wav_ASR	yeah
tcu07a_200.964_6.82.wav_ASR	and and and name my name
tcu07a_208.7_5.2.wav_ASR	mean mean the other thing they wanna know is my
tcu07a_215.061_0.83.wav_ASR	five i don't remember
tcu07a_215.906_3.67.wav_ASR	remember a lot of things
tcu07a_219.6_1.14.wav_ASR	yes i guess
tcu07a_221.351_6.26.wav_ASR	and so they've just been every until slowly slowly doing it
tcu07a_227.633_2.48.wav_ASR	really they've been
tcu07a_236.428_2.45.wav_ASR	and i don't know
tcu07a_239.174_1.82.wav_ASR	and now you think about it i don't know
tcu07a_241.134_0.35.wav_ASR	alright
tcu07a_244.801_0.45.wav_ASR	okay
tcu07a_252.532_0.39.wav_ASR	is it
tcu07a_252.946_1.09.wav_ASR	okay okay okay
tcu07a_261.678_10.64.wav_ASR	well they've been going and i've been going to the
tcu07a_275.306_3.41.wav_ASR	well evening the
tcu07a_278.941_5.81.wav_ASR	they out every every three days they come me
tcu07a_284.77_5.06.wav_ASR	and and i mean they're in the sea with the umbrella
tcu07a_289.849_2.0.wav_ASR	they i do the every
tcu07a_292.232_6.95.wav_ASR	three i can talk every three three days a week
tcu07a_299.2_1.1.wav_ASR	and they're all happy
tcu07a_300.459_2.54.wav_ASR	and talk and talk and talk and talk
tcu07a_303.189_9.4.wav_ASR	so i do find out feel that when i go with my band that it helps
tcu07a_312.787_1.43.wav_ASR	you know i find myself
tcu07a_314.811_3.77.wav_ASR	and seems like every time i the little bit more you know
tcu07a_318.6_0.53.wav_ASR	so
tcu07a_320.674_0.42.wav_ASR	yeah
tcu07a_322.153_0.55.wav_ASR	yeah
tcu07a_358.045_6.12.wav_ASR	the the dance with him but you know
tcu07a_365.261_1.33.wav_ASR	yeah but been
tcu07a_367.6_2.3.wav_ASR	but it's hard to think of the umbrella
tcu07a_370.3_3.58.wav_ASR	oh i
tcu07a_374.981_1.26.wav_ASR	yeah probably
tcu07a_378.643_0.4.wav_ASR	now
tcu07a_386.09_0.55.wav_ASR	yeah
tcu07a_387.006_0.82.wav_ASR	that's a good one
tcu07a_390.512_0.62.wav_ASR	oh
tcu07a_391.301_5.4.wav_ASR	he he he gives me a lot
tcu07a_396.719_2.71.wav_ASR	he he i didn't have him
tcu07a_401.411_5.31.wav_ASR	but they kept a lot of time for me
tcu07a_408.237_4.18.wav_ASR	put it together
tcu07a_413.77_2.46.wav_ASR	and i don't think what else i can talk about
tcu07a_422.86_7.74.wav_ASR	well i don't know if i get him
tcu07a_431.851_1.14.wav_ASR	canq and galq
tcu07a_433.5_4.17.wav_ASR	it's it it's kinda hard to buy things
tcu07a_437.686_2.63.wav_ASR	it's hard to talk a lot of things
tcu07a_440.368_3.96.wav_ASR	and i don't think who can
tcu07a_445.416_6.7.wav_ASR	well no the i know they but i don't sometimes they don't
tcu07a_454.244_1.07.wav_ASR	they it's fun
tcu07a_455.33_6.1.wav_ASR	they they all of my friends i know that remember things
tcu07a_462.238_2.28.wav_ASR	and but i don't remember
tcu07a_464.828_0.52.wav_ASR	umbrella
tcu07a_465.853_0.65.wav_ASR	it's weird
tcu07a_473.491_1.459.wav_ASR	you know i i kinda wonder you know
tcu07a_474.967_2.21.wav_ASR	but i remember rehab but it down
tcu07a_477.224_2.28.wav_ASR	umbrella i know it
tcu07a_481.185_1.145.wav_ASR	but i don't know
tcu07a_499.703_0.49.wav_ASR	okay
tcu07a_500.888_2.29.wav_ASR	there's a
tcu07a_505.634_2.07.wav_ASR	we had a dog dog
tcu07a_508.455_0.94.wav_ASR	we have a
tcu07a_512.279_0.63.wav_ASR	we have
tcu07a_514.114_1.27.wav_ASR	oh my god
tcu07a_516.746_6.841.wav_ASR	we have a boy boy who
tcu07a_523.823_5.47.wav_ASR	he he was doing his
tcu07a_530.721_3.18.wav_ASR	he he hit the window
tcu07a_535.111_2.87.wav_ASR	and he yeah
tcu07a_538.17_2.34.wav_ASR	and he
tcu07a_541.2_5.12.wav_ASR	he he got his dingo
tcu07a_547.025_3.51.wav_ASR	he went to the dance
tcu07a_552.581_9.56.wav_ASR	and it drove drove and drove on to the here
tcu07a_563.166_6.88.wav_ASR	and in the
tcu07a_571.77_0.61.wav_ASR	galaxy
tcu07a_574.061_11.43.wav_ASR	the was and gave gave it and found out what was going on
tcu07a_585.595_0.57.wav_ASR	oh
tcu07a_591.788_0.35.wav_ASR	mkay
tcu07a_601.0_0.36.wav_ASR	okay
tcu07a_602.696_0.46.wav_ASR	okay
tcu07a_603.992_8.79.wav_ASR	there was a mother and her her
tcu07a_615.423_20.75.wav_ASR	and he was telling her to took her to take take it
tcu07a_637.149_2.45.wav_ASR	and so
tcu07a_642.247_0.35.wav_ASR	and she
tcu07a_642.854_1.48.wav_ASR	well i don't need it
tcu07a_645.573_10.02.wav_ASR	and so he started to go go
tcu07a_656.225_7.02.wav_ASR	and he started and realized that he needed it
tcu07a_663.668_10.2.wav_ASR	so so he got the things from mom
tcu07a_674.299_13.15.wav_ASR	and and now he got a thing now
tcu07a_705.629_0.55.wav_ASR	okay
tcu07a_706.919_0.66.wav_ASR	and there's
tcu07a_709.213_4.84.wav_ASR	he he is drenched drenched
tcu07a_714.105_3.62.wav_ASR	or maybe he's walking walking
tcu07a_718.686_2.0.wav_ASR	and he is
tcu07a_722.226_6.54.wav_ASR	but he was had hisding and he had hisding up
tcu07a_729.621_0.69.wav_ASR	and he fell
tcu07a_730.508_2.92.wav_ASR	he's he's thinking fast
tcu07a_734.264_6.18.wav_ASR	and so now he's just up here by himself
tcu07a_741.603_4.92.wav_ASR	and so he somebody called
tcu07a_747.232_5.05.wav_ASR	and so now he's he man is coming up
tcu07a_752.706_2.87.wav_ASR	and they're gonna get the
tcu07a_756.359_2.18.wav_ASR	we did the thing up
tcu07a_759.12_5.13.wav_ASR	so he can take his umbrella and make it down in the man
tcu07a_766.256_4.05.wav_ASR	but the reason even emergencies he was on here
tcu07a_771.091_5.47.wav_ASR	because i was having fun to help her
tcu07a_777.474_8.41.wav_ASR	with the dog and man man man man
tcu07a_786.29_0.77.wav_ASR	can't think of the word
tcu07a_788.525_7.26.wav_ASR	and and that's how waiting the in any way
tcu07a_796.339_5.59.wav_ASR	but ended up he did be the one that was in
tcu07a_803.428_0.37.wav_ASR	okay
tcu07a_810.884_0.43.wav_ASR	yeah
tcu07a_817.503_0.34.wav_ASR	yeah
tcu07a_822.929_1.62.wav_ASR	improve yourself of the details
tcu07a_824.817_0.32.wav_ASR	alright
tcu07a_829.258_0.31.wav_ASR	okay
tcu07a_832.777_0.33.wav_ASR	okay
tcu07a_923.902_0.54.wav_ASR	mkay
tcu07a_932.792_1.57.wav_ASR	okay
tcu07a_936.625_3.32.wav_ASR	three she was a
tcu07a_943.222_1.11.wav_ASR	and he
tcu07a_947.118_4.63.wav_ASR	he he he was a
tcu07a_955.779_0.59.wav_ASR	oh mean no
tcu07a_956.619_4.65.wav_ASR	he was
tcu07a_969.306_4.23.wav_ASR	and anyway hurry hurry
tcu07a_974.209_3.69.wav_ASR	he did to be
tcu07a_978.898_11.55.wav_ASR	they were all three gonna go to the going to the
tcu07a_991.517_2.85.wav_ASR	it was a
tcu07a_995.165_3.1.wav_ASR	and they wouldn't let her
tcu07a_999.781_0.87.wav_ASR	so they went
tcu07a_1001.665_2.88.wav_ASR	and and and seizures in there
tcu07a_1004.567_11.65.wav_ASR	and her this lady was like her mother was like a thing her mother
tcu07a_1016.234_0.87.wav_ASR	yeah well
tcu07a_1017.905_4.8.wav_ASR	and so she done done a thing on him
tcu07a_1023.107_4.01.wav_ASR	and and so he he ran
tcu07a_1028.26_2.54.wav_ASR	and she could do it for so long
tcu07a_1031.136_3.36.wav_ASR	and then he he hadta get him home
tcu07a_1034.922_4.78.wav_ASR	because he would be to go back into the
tcu07a_1040.481_1.68.wav_ASR	he would change
tcu07a_1043.239_4.609.wav_ASR	so after that he left
tcu07a_1051.113_2.61.wav_ASR	he knocked her thing behind behind
tcu07a_1054.499_2.85.wav_ASR	so he he tried the ladder
tcu07a_1058.294_7.77.wav_ASR	and they hadta take everybody
tcu07a_1066.532_4.0.wav_ASR	and he finally finally found her
tcu07a_1070.549_1.74.wav_ASR	one
tcu07a_1072.994_5.63.wav_ASR	and they were in favorite
tcu07a_1078.898_1.38.wav_ASR	okay

UCL02a_31.699_1.62.wav_ASR	thank you
UCL02a_34.593_2.69.wav_ASR	well maybe you don't know
UCL02a_37.33_2.09.wav_ASR	so sometimes it's a little bit this morning it isn't
UCL02a_39.439_0.94.wav_ASR	thank you very much
UCL02a_40.4_0.93.wav_ASR	it's beautiful isn't it today
UCL02a_43.429_1.1.wav_ASR	speaking i come good
UCL02a_44.544_1.86.wav_ASR	sometimes i can talk
UCL02a_47.789_2.6.wav_ASR	three not here what's happening about me now
UCL02a_50.411_1.47.wav_ASR	can't
UCL02a_53.073_3.41.wav_ASR	you know they're saying to me the big problem be sometime suddenly one word is just gone
UCL02a_56.5_1.63.wav_ASR	you know
UCL02a_58.449_1.89.wav_ASR	oh i just talked to me at that now i kinda remember
UCL02a_61.489_4.3.wav_ASR	weeks i think i can hear about everything
UCL02a_66.983_3.54.wav_ASR	and i can hear everything
UCL02a_70.775_5.62.wav_ASR	and then suddenly it just disappears from me now
UCL02a_77.532_0.76.wav_ASR	it's hard to tell
UCL02a_78.308_2.25.wav_ASR	sometimes suddenly one day he can be perfect
UCL02a_81.517_1.77.wav_ASR	well perfect i mean but it is different
UCL02a_83.309_5.47.wav_ASR	then sometimes it's i just can't hear some things you know
UCL02a_88.8_1.82.wav_ASR	that's a difficult thing with with with the speech
UCL02a_92.492_4.69.wav_ASR	and then i'll tell you sometimes it's okay
UCL02a_97.24_3.13.wav_ASR	and then of course suddenly one word is just disappearing from me as well
UCL02a_100.812_1.34.wav_ASR	oh from the
UCL02a_102.173_0.54.wav_ASR	they're okay
UCL02a_103.893_3.39.wav_ASR	and then suddenly one word is really pretty for speaking to to speak everybody
UCL02a_107.33_0.65.wav_ASR	he's good for me
UCL02a_108.7_2.11.wav_ASR	and then suddenly just make me so tired
UCL02a_111.006_1.62.wav_ASR	well tied but then i just kinda here
UCL02a_112.82_1.55.wav_ASR	he's difficult to tell you know
UCL02a_115.317_8.88.wav_ASR	yeah i wanna talk about it well
UCL02a_124.218_1.15.wav_ASR	so many things about me well
UCL02a_125.597_8.35.wav_ASR	two i try many times about my speech and everybody
UCL02a_134.03_3.34.wav_ASR	sometimes it's brilliant
UCL02a_137.419_4.91.wav_ASR	when people talk to me and then i guess the what they talking to me is
UCL02a_142.345_3.14.wav_ASR	and i think maybe one little word is it's disappeared from me now
UCL02a_146.052_0.98.wav_ASR	one word is gone
UCL02a_147.699_2.65.wav_ASR	and then suddenly the me just terrible one i can't hear everything
UCL02a_151.038_4.42.wav_ASR	he's he's sitting on the branch
UCL02a_155.949_12.23.wav_ASR	sometimes the bad thing is sometimes where is you you i don't do anything for me
UCL02a_168.2_1.91.wav_ASR	that's that's big bad and make me feel good
UCL02a_171.11_1.02.wav_ASR	he's very difficult for me
UCL02a_172.344_1.12.wav_ASR	they're very difficult sometimes
UCL02a_173.565_1.16.wav_ASR	that's when he was bad with his
UCL02a_175.216_2.16.wav_ASR	you can't speak to my
UCL02a_177.398_0.78.wav_ASR	slap them together
UCL02a_178.199_1.64.wav_ASR	and that's very difficult you somebody like that
UCL02a_180.635_5.7.wav_ASR	and you get rushing rushing
UCL02a_186.35_0.66.wav_ASR	and i'm saying yeah
UCL02a_187.33_0.32.wav_ASR	yeah
UCL02a_188.404_3.4.wav_ASR	well that can be terrible sometimes
UCL02a_192.01_4.9.wav_ASR	sometimes
UCL02a_198.705_2.08.wav_ASR	difficult for me about what it's about speech as well
UCL02a_200.83_1.55.wav_ASR	seven times i know reading books
UCL02a_202.4_2.79.wav_ASR	useta read a lot of things you know before i did my stroke okay
UCL02a_205.21_1.04.wav_ASR	but i read a lot of books
UCL02a_206.693_3.1.wav_ASR	now it's difficult for me as i speak but my books to me
UCL02a_210.781_7.56.wav_ASR	and the awful thing for me sometimes i'm reading some of my books about two pages and then i can't remember what i'm talking about
UCL02a_218.619_3.13.wav_ASR	the half page are reading about and then suddenly
UCL02a_222.2_2.17.wav_ASR	good yes that's pretty good for what i'm reading about that
UCL02a_224.65_1.38.wav_ASR	and then suddenly one branch helps him
UCL02a_226.05_0.43.wav_ASR	just gone
UCL02a_226.69_0.88.wav_ASR	it's terrible as well
UCL02a_228.468_4.2.wav_ASR	so many times i'm reading again and i kinda what i'm talking what i'm talking about the time before
UCL02a_232.729_1.01.wav_ASR	but these are terrible you know
UCL02a_234.485_8.7.wav_ASR	yeah i hadta be sunny as well while i'm watching films and things like that for me as well

UCL02a_268.09_0.94.wav_ASR	so things are again
UCL02a_269.046_0.67.wav_ASR	that's quite good
UCL02a_270.468_3.7.wav_ASR	because i can't what they're talking about without a phone so
UCL02a_274.691_5.27.wav_ASR	slippers are really good for me really good things as well

UCL02a_621.961_1.52.wav_ASR	yeah they're writing down
UCL02a_624.359_1.26.wav_ASR	so they say that
UCL02a_625.666_1.39.wav_ASR	and i couldn't speak anything as well
UCL02a_628.52_4.16.wav_ASR	that's the worst in about three or four weeks
UCL02a_632.699_1.28.wav_ASR	remember as well
UCL02a_634.0_2.21.wav_ASR	oh everybody staying around that that that
UCL02a_637.869_2.91.wav_ASR	and then after that as well
UCL02a_640.8_0.48.wav_ASR	so yes
UCL02a_641.3_2.15.wav_ASR	so my nephews are u c p playing here
UCL02a_644.103_1.81.wav_ASR	and then this play is the recording from him
UCL02a_646.0_0.38.wav_ASR	slipper
UCL02a_646.4_5.93.wav_ASR	the queen queen queen queen
UCL02a_652.975_4.0.wav_ASR	the new orleans you know yeah
UCL02a_657.478_1.21.wav_ASR	as far as two weeks as well
UCL02a_659.32_1.48.wav_ASR	and they're testing them out
UCL02a_661.705_2.51.wav_ASR	so that's i'm i'm i'm it's not happy any since the day
UCL02a_664.318_1.87.wav_ASR	that's the first day that i met on the first stroke yeah
UCL02a_675.556_1.58.wav_ASR	that's not getting any better yeah
UCL02a_677.863_3.8.wav_ASR	it's strange
UCL02a_681.681_3.38.wav_ASR	spoon the next thing for me i sposta be about two weeks after i have
UCL02a_685.08_1.4.wav_ASR	oh the first first year you know
UCL02a_686.5_1.06.wav_ASR	one two
UCL02a_687.622_3.32.wav_ASR	and then two excite the newspaper
UCL02a_691.037_1.37.wav_ASR	can't speak the first word as well
UCL02a_693.677_2.17.wav_ASR	five i remember that it was the first one about two weeks
UCL02a_695.871_6.85.wav_ASR	and then those some people were testing me up for like others for the video
UCL02a_704.304_2.18.wav_ASR	and some lady was to the doctor
UCL02a_706.5_3.48.wav_ASR	there's lots of tests and things like that and vaia
UCL02a_712.938_1.25.wav_ASR	and she's upset me
UCL02a_714.208_1.77.wav_ASR	and you know these feet of mine
UCL02a_716.0_3.65.wav_ASR	and oh these cats
UCL02a_719.666_1.46.wav_ASR	the dog and everything like that
UCL02a_721.149_1.73.wav_ASR	what's this and some other things to me
UCL02a_723.85_4.47.wav_ASR	and sometimes i couldn't what she was talking about
UCL02a_728.336_1.86.wav_ASR	and he's just as said you liked the footthings
UCL02a_730.212_3.77.wav_ASR	there's a dog and you know square things and that kind of thing like that
UCL02a_738.114_2.95.wav_ASR	but after about two weeks another place
UCL02a_741.126_4.6.wav_ASR	and then that was called the stroke community people's well
UCL02a_747.398_2.78.wav_ASR	and the other thing was then one group of people helping me out
UCL02a_750.539_5.96.wav_ASR	stroke community people helping people help him for writing some words to me for writing some words to me for writing some words to me for writing some words to me for writing some words to me for writing some words to me
UCL02a_757.561_3.75.wav_ASR	help him me some words and maybe
UCL02a_761.331_3.15.wav_ASR	like you know it's in monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday saturday
UCL02a_764.5_1.42.wav_ASR	the first day i couldn't tell you
UCL02a_766.211_2.02.wav_ASR	he's in monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday
UCL02a_768.626_0.55.wav_ASR	five i could remember
UCL02a_769.252_0.9.wav_ASR	he's at monday to the
UCL02a_770.176_1.63.wav_ASR	they couldn't speak the word
UCL02a_772.961_6.7.wav_ASR	it's the first day second word third word first day second third fourth fifth
UCL02a_779.679_0.83.wav_ASR	and then i couldn't
UCL02a_781.953_1.63.wav_ASR	well i still have a lot of problems with that now
UCL02a_783.712_1.47.wav_ASR	he's one two three four five six seven eight
UCL02a_785.2_1.08.wav_ASR	they're not double checking them around
UCL02a_786.37_3.78.wav_ASR	but i remember the first time i'm telling him he's i couldn't speak up
UCL02a_790.171_3.41.wav_ASR	you know what days
UCL02a_793.6_0.79.wav_ASR	what i'm i
UCL02a_795.524_1.21.wav_ASR	well you're my going
UCL02a_796.901_1.38.wav_ASR	and i couldn't write what things are again
UCL02a_799.104_2.08.wav_ASR	that's difficult for me as well you know
UCL02a_801.24_3.72.wav_ASR	there were some people i sposta be about
UCL02a_806.4_3.15.wav_ASR	as about six months she was there
UCL02a_810.46_2.21.wav_ASR	every week for me some lady was talking to me
UCL02a_812.693_6.05.wav_ASR	and just you know reaching some words and helping out and that that
UCL02a_818.791_1.44.wav_ASR	well i suppose that's about two weeks
UCL02a_821.718_4.68.wav_ASR	and then after that i was there
UCL02a_826.419_1.74.wav_ASR	so three weeks and then
UCL02a_828.767_2.69.wav_ASR	oh six weeks or nine weeks as yeah
UCL02a_832.093_7.38.wav_ASR	then after nine months and then with ucl at ul fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl fl
UCL02a_840.063_1.49.wav_ASR	that was you first test as well
UCL02a_841.662_2.74.wav_ASR	spoon that was that
UCL02a_845.928_4.83.wav_ASR	you know with the stroke i you know with the stroke you know it i walk around
UCL02a_850.827_3.82.wav_ASR	then those are the big problem for me is you know things like that
UCL02a_854.716_0.61.wav_ASR	that's okay
UCL02a_856.337_3.78.wav_ASR	you know i'll by the bus and the cruise and everything like that
UCL02a_860.14_0.69.wav_ASR	he's funny
UCL02a_861.098_3.8.wav_ASR	it come about that you know about the shoe by myself
UCL02a_865.175_1.64.wav_ASR	and not being to help people as well
UCL02a_867.837_2.54.wav_ASR	that's a word for me
UCL02a_870.4_4.58.wav_ASR	yeah i think it was strange other people that were the some people know we were the aphasia people
UCL02a_875.2_1.96.wav_ASR	if you're by yourself a lot
UCL02a_877.224_0.68.wav_ASR	he's gonna help
UCL02a_878.342_1.19.wav_ASR	and he's gonna help
UCL02a_881.28_2.41.wav_ASR	can't be worried for me sometimes
UCL02a_883.763_1.66.wav_ASR	but i'm not much better than now
UCL02a_885.443_1.45.wav_ASR	but it can be terrible you know
UCL02a_887.833_4.93.wav_ASR	the i can't speak what i'm talking about now to other people you know
UCL02a_893.03_5.1.wav_ASR	but i suppose after us that is better for me now
UCL02a_898.696_6.84.wav_ASR	but yeah i mean physically you walking around
UCL02a_905.56_0.96.wav_ASR	that's fine for me
UCL02a_907.365_2.52.wav_ASR	but it's you know it's my own brain thing as well
UCL02a_909.992_0.51.wav_ASR	yeah we go
UCL02a_911.188_1.79.wav_ASR	so i'm getting excited yeah yeah
UCL02a_940.576_0.67.wav_ASR	see i'm good
UCL02a_941.493_0.61.wav_ASR	just say it again
UCL02a_942.392_1.14.wav_ASR	hadta say it again and again and again
UCL02a_948.585_0.9.wav_ASR	it was a little kid
UCL02a_955.002_2.69.wav_ASR	oh well i'm a kid or one of the kids he says
UCL02a_966.107_3.03.wav_ASR	then then what do i wanna really happen to me yeah yeah
UCL02a_971.144_7.25.wav_ASR	it's you know you said about what what what was happening to me as a kid yeah
UCL02a_978.444_0.75.wav_ASR	oh alright yeah
UCL02a_979.633_2.56.wav_ASR	me speaking the language and things like that or
UCL02a_986.138_3.38.wav_ASR	yeah anyway what is the story behind that's quite strange and a lot of days as well
UCL02a_989.538_1.6.wav_ASR	what is now i'm fifty eight
UCL02a_992.535_2.48.wav_ASR	but i remember a kid i was lucky when i was kid
UCL02a_995.033_0.71.wav_ASR	he's drenched as hell
UCL02a_995.761_5.8.wav_ASR	oh i mean i was about ten ten to thirteen years as a kid
UCL02a_1002.376_7.93.wav_ASR	and i was leaving in in naples easily as a kid
UCL02a_1010.322_6.55.wav_ASR	oh i was boarding school in england well but then my dad had his job out in italy as well
UCL02a_1017.003_0.78.wav_ASR	hadta be back there as well
UCL02a_1018.974_1.8.wav_ASR	but it's strange you take about those things happy and so
UCL02a_1020.913_2.78.wav_ASR	but i remember that was
UCL02a_1024.459_3.88.wav_ASR	they almost lived in germany as well about you know five years as well but then back to england
UCL02a_1029.03_3.799.wav_ASR	and then back to the after about to easily as well
UCL02a_1033.867_3.061.wav_ASR	and it drenches the whole days
UCL02a_1038.126_1.02.wav_ASR	it was wonderful
UCL02a_1039.807_0.56.wav_ASR	that's it
UCL02a_1040.387_2.99.wav_ASR	we lived in naples just outside of naples
UCL02a_1044.069_3.01.wav_ASR	hadta use the umbrella from the
UCL02a_1047.13_2.44.wav_ASR	from where i was the difference you could see
UCL02a_1053.355_0.79.wav_ASR	vegas
UCL02a_1054.307_0.36.wav_ASR	okay
UCL02a_1055.824_2.03.wav_ASR	vei us
UCL02a_1058.851_0.67.wav_ASR	you know all that thing
UCL02a_1060.129_0.32.wav_ASR	umbrella
UCL02a_1061.36_1.67.wav_ASR	vegas
UCL02a_1063.289_0.95.wav_ASR	it's gotta be the word
UCL02a_1064.257_1.25.wav_ASR	yeah the big wall was there
UCL02a_1066.615_3.45.wav_ASR	and i write about it as well
UCL02a_1070.089_2.69.wav_ASR	it was up especially one of my being a kid up there
UCL02a_1072.85_4.61.wav_ASR	okay that was good as well as well we live not far way down from the beach

wright204a_258.047_5.38.wav_ASR	and from then on then i was at baltimore
wright204a_263.563_11.04.wav_ASR	and i remember all of the letters where i had all three of things for speech therapy
wright204a_285.874_1.82.wav_ASR	well i'm a lot slower than usual
wright204a_288.289_6.62.wav_ASR	hadta learn to use more of my left hand than i wanted to
wright204a_295.072_5.09.wav_ASR	but i was paralyzed on the whole right side

wright204a_303.069_4.89.wav_ASR	when i get out of the hospital for the third time i was in a wheelchair
wright204a_315.318_2.19.wav_ASR	oh they were all all from one to the other
wright204a_318.564_0.31.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_319.489_15.42.wav_ASR	so it really from december of august through about the end of september october november december of all the year i was in the hospital
wright204a_337.032_3.05.wav_ASR	because we had different problems
wright204a_340.132_1.81.wav_ASR	and i had knee pain
wright204a_343.379_4.39.wav_ASR	one i had some other kind of things that i i don't even remember
wright204a_348.779_3.78.wav_ASR	and so it it took a long time just to get out of the hospital
wright204a_353.142_6.05.wav_ASR	but i was home in december to january
wright204a_360.553_13.81.wav_ASR	several in february four no third i started out therapy at chicago regional hospital over in chicago

wright204a_466.905_2.09.wav_ASR	oh i had a good life as a child
wright204a_469.055_1.22.wav_ASR	it was an only child
wright204a_471.226_6.03.wav_ASR	oh i i don't really know what to say
wright204a_488.482_2.61.wav_ASR	he he's gonna get a little play
wright204a_551.677_4.2.wav_ASR	the little boy is playing with a soccer ball i guess
wright204a_556.512_3.27.wav_ASR	and he happens to hit the window
wright204a_562.435_1.63.wav_ASR	and he goes to the end
wright204a_564.087_8.98.wav_ASR	and he it the guy inside is is in the picture sitting down
wright204a_573.142_3.66.wav_ASR	and it hits him at least it comes in the window
wright204a_577.402_1.19.wav_ASR	so he's got glass
wright204a_579.694_1.82.wav_ASR	and he goes
wright204a_581.882_2.06.wav_ASR	and he looks at the window
wright204a_583.994_0.79.wav_ASR	he has the ball
wright204a_584.804_8.2.wav_ASR	and apparently he's going out to see what happened and maybe let the ball go back to the little child
wright204a_611.342_0.53.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_612.361_1.49.wav_ASR	looks like it's ready for school
wright204a_614.634_3.67.wav_ASR	he says looks like he might wanna take the umbrella
wright204a_619.559_2.09.wav_ASR	he's probably just said okay
wright204a_623.716_0.88.wav_ASR	did she say
wright204a_625.692_0.59.wav_ASR	maybe not
wright204a_626.402_0.35.wav_ASR	don't know
wright204a_626.8_2.35.wav_ASR	because now he's going to school
wright204a_629.803_0.94.wav_ASR	oh it is

wright204a_633.482_1.14.wav_ASR	he's
wright204a_634.899_1.17.wav_ASR	oh i don't think i need it
wright204a_637.004_1.53.wav_ASR	the dog
wright204a_639.482_1.63.wav_ASR	and he must be waiting for the bus
wright204a_641.129_1.2.wav_ASR	and it's getting to rain
wright204a_642.924_2.12.wav_ASR	so now it's coming down pretty good
wright204a_645.498_1.72.wav_ASR	so he goes back to the house
wright204a_647.796_0.36.wav_ASR	and he says
wright204a_648.654_0.66.wav_ASR	oh well
wright204a_650.019_0.33.wav_ASR	and he says
wright204a_651.289_1.3.wav_ASR	maybe i'd better go take the umbrella
wright204a_672.485_0.54.wav_ASR	let's see
wright204a_677.959_4.91.wav_ASR	looks like the problem is the cat is stuck up in the tree
