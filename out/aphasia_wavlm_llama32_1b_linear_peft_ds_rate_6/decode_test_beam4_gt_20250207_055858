fridriksson07a_142.991_1.34.wav_ASR	so the lady said
fridriksson07a_144.644_1.55.wav_ASR	i think she's having a stroke
fridriksson07a_147.515_0.959.wav_ASR	so she said
fridriksson07a_148.682_5.37.wav_ASR	there's a hospital just about the next street over
fridriksson07a_154.827_4.81.wav_ASR	so my husband got me in the van and went me over there

fridriksson07a_164.948_2.05.wav_ASR	he gave me the medication
fridriksson07a_169.715_0.46.wav_ASR	and
fridriksson07a_170.861_9.05.wav_ASR	so and then they they didn't have a place to to treat stroke victims
fridriksson07a_181.19_1.6.wav_ASR	but that intern knew what to do
fridriksson07a_182.837_4.29.wav_ASR	so they hadta put me in another ambulance and take it to another hospital

fridriksson07a_444.686_2.19.wav_ASR	i stayed at the university
fridriksson07a_447.397_6.8.wav_ASR	well i stayed at the austin stroke clinic for
fridriksson07a_456.3_2.82.wav_ASR	i think i was in there about three weeks

fridriksson07a_467.107_4.77.wav_ASR	and then i got in the wheelchair and and i said
fridriksson07a_472.02_3.83.wav_ASR	i don't want those legs that you you put your foot legs in
fridriksson07a_476.555_1.66.wav_ASR	and i put my feet on the floor table
fridriksson07a_478.5_1.15.wav_ASR	and that was it
fridriksson07a_488.923_2.87.wav_ASR	yeah i ran all over that hospital in the wheelchair
fridriksson07a_491.814_4.36.wav_ASR	well they wouldn't let me off the floor but the it was a big floor you know
fridriksson07a_497.438_3.59.wav_ASR	yeah but i was there for a long time
fridriksson07a_501.709_2.11.wav_ASR	about i i think three or four weeks
fridriksson07a_503.871_1.97.wav_ASR	and then i was discharged
fridriksson07a_505.858_4.21.wav_ASR	and then i hadta come back for therapy three times a week
fridriksson07a_519.422_3.589.wav_ASR	well we did physical therapy

fridriksson07a_533.132_5.07.wav_ASR	and then slowly but surely i realized that i've lost a lot of things
fridriksson07a_539.154_3.42.wav_ASR	because up here i could add like crazy and i still can
fridriksson07a_543.361_1.97.wav_ASR	but to get it out i can't do it
fridriksson07a_546.994_0.36.wav_ASR	mhm
fridriksson07a_552.553_5.4.wav_ASR	i can say it sometimes but when i write it down it it's just jumbled up
fridriksson07a_559.385_8.25.wav_ASR	if if i can add up to one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine i might put down nine thousand one hundred and ninety nine
fridriksson07a_573.324_1.49.wav_ASR	that was three years ago
fridriksson07a_575.777_2.22.wav_ASR	and the other one i knew nothing about
fridriksson07a_578.016_3.11.wav_ASR	but they said there was a former one a smaller one
fridriksson07a_586.492_1.93.wav_ASR	yeah even though i had it
fridriksson07a_597.83_0.48.wav_ASR	okay

fridriksson07a_644.678_2.5.wav_ASR	not in florida in texas
fridriksson07a_647.575_1.38.wav_ASR	and we moved down there
fridriksson07a_649.271_5.85.wav_ASR	because then she got pregnant and her husband was working in dc
fridriksson07a_655.553_3.27.wav_ASR	so she we went down there to help take care of the baby
fridriksson07a_660.026_1.75.wav_ASR	that was a good things

fridriksson07a_741.969_2.72.wav_ASR	this is when the ball is coming through his window
fridriksson07a_744.804_1.02.wav_ASR	the window is broken
fridriksson07a_747.278_3.42.wav_ASR	and this he's looking out probably to see who did it
fridriksson07a_752.449_1.52.wav_ASR	that's what i'd be looking for
fridriksson07a_785.694_3.29.wav_ASR	well i think
fridriksson07a_790.253_2.85.wav_ASR	so i this is not really number one right
fridriksson07a_796.242_0.63.wav_ASR	oh okay

fridriksson07a_811.5_1.6.wav_ASR	he's got his umbrella right
fridriksson07a_815.878_0.51.wav_ASR	okay
fridriksson07a_817.162_0.42.wav_ASR	oh
fridriksson07a_821.77_2.95.wav_ASR	he has an umbrella on here
fridriksson07a_825.093_5.53.wav_ASR	and he must have been outside and it's raining and he comes back in for an umbrella right
fridriksson07a_832.955_1.49.wav_ASR	so not in order
fridriksson07a_840.232_2.07.wav_ASR	okay there he's getting ready to leave
fridriksson07a_842.321_2.02.wav_ASR	and his mother's giving him an umbrella
fridriksson07a_846.794_3.74.wav_ASR	or she's why is
fridriksson07a_852.162_0.48.wav_ASR	okay
fridriksson07a_854.431_2.41.wav_ASR	she's still giving him the umbrella right
fridriksson07a_857.405_1.36.wav_ASR	oh these two go together
fridriksson07a_866.611_0.63.wav_ASR	okay
fridriksson07a_868.979_2.65.wav_ASR	okay then he walks outside and it's raining
fridriksson07a_871.65_3.54.wav_ASR	he doesn't have the umbrella or he would put it up right
fridriksson07a_876.373_1.0.wav_ASR	he comes back in
fridriksson07a_877.593_0.6.wav_ASR	he's all wet
fridriksson07a_878.21_2.01.wav_ASR	and now he has his umbrella up
fridriksson07a_881.005_1.305.wav_ASR	and he's ready to go to school
fridriksson07a_882.387_2.95.wav_ASR	why didn't he put his umbrella up in number three
fridriksson07a_888.499_0.65.wav_ASR	okay
fridriksson07a_902.448_0.37.wav_ASR	okay
fridriksson07a_903.463_3.92.wav_ASR	this one the cat is up a tree
fridriksson07a_908.344_2.97.wav_ASR	and that looks like the father went after it
fridriksson07a_913.497_3.77.wav_ASR	and the little girl's standing there ready to catch him i guess
fridriksson07a_917.394_1.71.wav_ASR	she was riding her bike
fridriksson07a_921.067_0.67.wav_ASR	and somebody
fridriksson07a_922.129_1.97.wav_ASR	oh here's a dog barking up the tree
fridriksson07a_924.145_1.83.wav_ASR	and they've called the fire department
fridriksson07a_928.923_1.59.wav_ASR	so they'll get the cat out right
fridriksson07a_932.955_6.92.wav_ASR	i couldn't understand what the ladder's for but i guess the guy climbed up the ladder and got in the tree and then the ladder fell
fridriksson07a_954.76_0.34.wav_ASR	yes
fridriksson07a_958.107_4.76.wav_ASR	i think the last time i read it was years ago
fridriksson07a_975.646_0.54.wav_ASR	okay
fridriksson07a_1095.08_12.54.wav_ASR	well the the thing of it is is that that she was under the control of her stepmother and two stepsisters
fridriksson07a_1108.411_2.15.wav_ASR	and they were treated her like a maid
fridriksson07a_1111.509_4.88.wav_ASR	and then they were having a ball at the
fridriksson07a_1117.065_3.86.wav_ASR	that's what she was looking out the window at the castle and everything
fridriksson07a_1121.443_6.61.wav_ASR	and then when they decided they wouldn't let her go because she would be in competition with the two sisters
fridriksson07a_1129.018_3.57.wav_ASR	and then a fairy godmother came
fridriksson07a_1133.326_5.58.wav_ASR	and got her all dressed and everything and ready to go to the ball
fridriksson07a_1139.72_2.4.wav_ASR	and gave her a pair of slippers
fridriksson07a_1143.746_8.07.wav_ASR	and she went to the ball but she hadta be back by twelve o'clock
fridriksson07a_1153.31_1.67.wav_ASR	and so she was dancing
fridriksson07a_1155.0_4.63.wav_ASR	the the prince chose her to dance with
fridriksson07a_1159.677_2.02.wav_ASR	and i guess he fell in love right away
fridriksson07a_1162.249_4.76.wav_ASR	and then the clock struck twelve
fridriksson07a_1167.86_3.01.wav_ASR	and she ran out but she lost a slipper
fridriksson07a_1172.448_1.9.wav_ASR	and then they found the slipper
fridriksson07a_1174.419_9.12.wav_ASR	and then by the time she got back her her her chariot had turned to a pumpkin
fridriksson07a_1184.579_1.19.wav_ASR	i think that's the way it was
fridriksson07a_1185.919_1.97.wav_ASR	okay now let me think a minute
fridriksson07a_1188.29_6.09.wav_ASR	and so they were going all over looking for the person that lost the slipper
fridriksson07a_1194.4_3.25.wav_ASR	and they came back to cinderella's house
fridriksson07a_1198.045_4.27.wav_ASR	so they tried it with the two stepsisters and it didn't fit
fridriksson07a_1203.12_4.56.wav_ASR	so then they asked cinderella to try it in
fridriksson07a_1207.7_1.21.wav_ASR	and then they were just
fridriksson07a_1209.733_1.54.wav_ASR	no no no she wasn't even there
fridriksson07a_1211.295_5.34.wav_ASR	but when they tried it on then it fit
fridriksson07a_1217.703_5.54.wav_ASR	so they took her back to the the palace
fridriksson07a_1224.46_4.25.wav_ASR	and the she married the prince
fridriksson07a_1231.895_1.51.wav_ASR	and i don't know
fridriksson07a_1233.591_1.89.wav_ASR	i guess she lived happily ever after
fridriksson07a_1235.5_2.72.wav_ASR	that's the way all stories like that end
fridriksson07a_1250.689_2.41.wav_ASR	oh well first you get the peanut butter out
fridriksson07a_1253.322_1.07.wav_ASR	you get your bread
fridriksson07a_1255.267_3.84.wav_ASR	you put put the peanut butter on one side
fridriksson07a_1259.325_3.76.wav_ASR	and then the other side you put the jelly
fridriksson07a_1263.241_1.1.wav_ASR	and then you put it together
fridriksson07a_1264.393_1.48.wav_ASR	and you cut it
fridriksson07a_1266.034_0.62.wav_ASR	and that's it

kansas04a_30.225_7.48.wav_ASR	it's february twenty eighth in ninety eight
kansas04a_42.61_11.38.wav_ASR	well my stroke started on one night and i did not think it was too bad
kansas04a_54.764_1.58.wav_ASR	well it started at noon actually
kansas04a_56.809_9.79.wav_ASR	and then i went out with my friends and they were concerned because i was driving erratically
kansas04a_68.079_9.21.wav_ASR	she said that i drove too close to cars and i had difficulty with my speech
kansas04a_77.957_5.16.wav_ASR	and i went home and i met my husband at the local watering hole
kansas04a_84.83_3.35.wav_ASR	and had a drink and i went home
kansas04a_88.529_5.344.wav_ASR	and that was not my usual way of doing
kansas04a_95.153_1.87.wav_ASR	not talking to anybody or anything
kansas04a_97.072_3.29.wav_ASR	and so i went home and i went to bed that night
kansas04a_100.589_2.91.wav_ASR	and i got up the next morning and went to work
kansas04a_104.276_4.63.wav_ASR	went to a a chamber meeting
kansas04a_109.508_10.63.wav_ASR	and i parked and went in and when i came back out i noticed that i parked very badly
kansas04a_121.372_4.48.wav_ASR	and i went to work and then one of the girls came in and said
kansas04a_126.873_2.64.wav_ASR	you're not using your arm correctly
kansas04a_131.007_0.4.wav_ASR	and i said
kansas04a_131.688_1.2.wav_ASR	i think i'm having a stroke
kansas04a_133.315_0.93.wav_ASR	call the doctor
kansas04a_134.744_8.79.wav_ASR	and she told she told me to go to the emergency room and not to drive
kansas04a_144.096_13.82.wav_ASR	and at that point i was confused enough that i was thinking about the hospital across the street at home and not one across the street from my office
kansas04a_158.827_1.8.wav_ASR	so i figured i'd drive myself
kansas04a_161.92_1.11.wav_ASR	so i drove myself
kansas04a_163.284_3.31.wav_ASR	and i got out there and parked in the proper place
kansas04a_167.312_3.2.wav_ASR	and went in and and then i met my husband there
kansas04a_170.986_6.08.wav_ASR	and i told him to tell them what what i thought
kansas04a_177.562_3.58.wav_ASR	because i could not communicate at that point
kansas04a_182.356_4.06.wav_ASR	and i was there for overnight and they sent me home
kansas04a_187.406_9.41.wav_ASR	and then i did not feel well the next morning so i he i had him take me back to the hospital and i stayed for couple weeks
kansas04a_207.011_5.1.wav_ASR	well i had therapy and on my speech and writing
kansas04a_213.604_6.17.wav_ASR	but they didn't give it to me for very long
kansas04a_220.931_5.04.wav_ASR	i mean i it was just when i was in the hospital i had my speech and and writing therapy
kansas04a_226.382_3.15.wav_ASR	and then i got home and had some physical therapy
kansas04a_259.052_0.729.wav_ASR	which story
kansas04a_263.423_8.6.wav_ASR	well when i got married the first time i hadta plan my whole wedding myself because mom was much older
kansas04a_273.102_2.34.wav_ASR	and she left it up to me
kansas04a_276.529_5.33.wav_ASR	and i went home and then went back to lawrence
kansas04a_281.881_3.75.wav_ASR	i got married in lawrence in danforth chapel
kansas04a_294.955_9.48.wav_ASR	and we had dinner and then we went to back to the hotel
kansas04a_304.94_3.42.wav_ASR	and my uncle married me
kansas04a_309.335_2.86.wav_ASR	yeah he's a methodist methodist minister
kansas04a_313.018_7.98.wav_ASR	and his wife took over the bathroom and didn't let let my sister or i in there
kansas04a_322.108_15.2.wav_ASR	and so then we went to the chapel and on the way my brother inlaw was driving and he almost wrecked us
kansas04a_342.23_1.91.wav_ASR	so i think that will be enough of that story
kansas04a_369.621_4.36.wav_ASR	well this little boy is practicing his soccer ball
kansas04a_376.048_2.66.wav_ASR	and then he kicks it through the window
kansas04a_379.812_1.49.wav_ASR	and it breaks the window
kansas04a_382.375_3.03.wav_ASR	and it goes into this man's house
kansas04a_386.256_1.9.wav_ASR	and he's very startled
kansas04a_389.349_6.47.wav_ASR	and he gets up and looks out the window to see where it came from
kansas04a_396.096_10.7.wav_ASR	now it does not tell you whether the boy ran away or whether he came and confessed that he had kicked the soccer ball
kansas04a_435.24_4.79.wav_ASR	mother wants the little boy to take the umbrella
kansas04a_443.068_1.73.wav_ASR	he doesn't wanna take the umbrella
kansas04a_446.585_4.68.wav_ASR	so he goes out and it starts to rain of course as his mother had told him it would
kansas04a_452.243_1.56.wav_ASR	so he goes back
kansas04a_454.24_0.91.wav_ASR	she tells him
kansas04a_455.171_1.15.wav_ASR	and he's very wet
kansas04a_457.426_5.56.wav_ASR	so he goes back in the house and she's very angry with him because he hasn't taken the umbrella
kansas04a_463.777_7.44.wav_ASR	so in the last picture he has the umbrella and it's up and he's walking very happily
kansas04a_506.81_1.84.wav_ASR	well the cat is in the tree
kansas04a_510.155_1.81.wav_ASR	dog is barking at the cat
kansas04a_513.126_4.38.wav_ASR	and the little girl is crying because her cat is in the tree
kansas04a_519.099_8.07.wav_ASR	and her father tried to get it with a ladder and the ladder has fallen down
kansas04a_527.276_4.41.wav_ASR	and the father is still in the tree and he's looking very glum
kansas04a_532.649_2.56.wav_ASR	and the birds are singing
kansas04a_537.485_4.46.wav_ASR	that's rather queer as everything else is going on
kansas04a_542.482_5.22.wav_ASR	and the firemen have been called and they are going to hafta get the cat down
kansas04a_547.988_3.8.wav_ASR	but i think before they do they'll hafta get daddy down
kansas04a_576.487_1.57.wav_ASR	there has been a flood
kansas04a_582.466_4.23.wav_ASR	and this lady has been swept away in the flood
kansas04a_590.504_12.69.wav_ASR	and this gentleman in the jacket is coming to rescue her
kansas04a_604.912_6.77.wav_ASR	he has been swept away in the flood also it looks to me
kansas04a_613.723_13.02.wav_ASR	and i do not quite understand this part
kansas04a_634.622_1.22.wav_ASR	yeah i think i am
kansas04a_636.851_1.21.wav_ASR	now what is that
kansas04a_643.48_6.31.wav_ASR	yeah but which one is being rescued and which one isn't
kansas04a_661.844_0.6.wav_ASR	oh yes
kansas04a_668.087_0.84.wav_ASR	not terribly
kansas04a_688.588_0.82.wav_ASR	okay
kansas04a_756.402_5.91.wav_ASR	the story is about cinderella and her wicked stepmother and her two stepsisters
kansas04a_762.492_0.68.wav_ASR	no yeah
kansas04a_763.997_11.67.wav_ASR	her stepsisters were very unkind to her and her stepmother was too
kansas04a_776.051_5.38.wav_ASR	cinderella was left to sweep and clean and do whatever they wanted done
kansas04a_782.592_7.02.wav_ASR	so they got a letter inviting the household to the the ball
kansas04a_791.424_5.37.wav_ASR	the mother said that cinderella could not go
kansas04a_798.1_1.62.wav_ASR	and she was very upset
kansas04a_800.608_12.89.wav_ASR	and so she tried to get her dress together and the two stepsisters tore it apart
kansas04a_815.132_22.74.wav_ASR	and so she went out and told her fairy godmother that they had torn it apart and she wasn't going to get to go
kansas04a_837.925_6.54.wav_ASR	and and she was crying and and the fairy godmother said yes she could
kansas04a_845.377_4.79.wav_ASR	got her dressed and in with her wand of course
kansas04a_850.747_14.83.wav_ASR	and so the step stepmother and stepchildren started out and she did not go with them
kansas04a_865.963_15.24.wav_ASR	but she went in the carriage that the fairy godmother had concocted out of a pumpkin and mice and horse
kansas04a_881.57_0.95.wav_ASR	the horse was the
kansas04a_883.45_2.91.wav_ASR	and she went to the ball
kansas04a_887.004_4.42.wav_ASR	and the prince greeted her at the ball
kansas04a_892.03_1.55.wav_ASR	and they danced
kansas04a_893.647_1.85.wav_ASR	and then it was twelve o'clock
kansas04a_895.645_2.1.wav_ASR	she hadta be home by twelve o'clock
kansas04a_897.799_2.56.wav_ASR	so she ran out and lost her slipper
kansas04a_901.571_7.85.wav_ASR	and she went and got the carriage and of course the carriage all collapsed
kansas04a_909.825_1.47.wav_ASR	and she went home
kansas04a_912.607_9.82.wav_ASR	and then the following week or so time elapsed
kansas04a_922.783_10.71.wav_ASR	the footman was sent out with a the slipper to find which girl in the kingdom it fit
kansas04a_934.46_7.29.wav_ASR	and she was locked in her room so she could not get to the come down
kansas04a_942.65_2.64.wav_ASR	and she was very upset
kansas04a_946.239_4.44.wav_ASR	and let's see
kansas04a_952.096_3.38.wav_ASR	anyway the the mice let her out
kansas04a_957.72_3.9.wav_ASR	and she came down and and of course she fit the slipper
kansas04a_962.075_1.87.wav_ASR	but the other did not
kansas04a_972.186_1.4.wav_ASR	yes
kansas04a_981.336_5.42.wav_ASR	i would get two pieces of bread the peanut butter and the jelly
kansas04a_988.038_1.31.wav_ASR	then i would get a knife
kansas04a_990.452_4.73.wav_ASR	and get get some of the peanut butter and spread it on one piece of bread
kansas04a_995.9_4.73.wav_ASR	and spread the jelly on the same piece of bread
kansas04a_1001.062_1.38.wav_ASR	and then put the top on it
kansas04a_1005.16_3.55.wav_ASR	oh yes i've had practice
kansas05a_1.945_0.43.wav_ASR	m

kansas05a_364.761_2.21.wav_ASR	i didn't mean that but
kansas05a_374.375_2.99.wav_ASR	because i wanna have us to do better
kansas05a_379.021_4.21.wav_ASR	it it's much more difficult
kansas05a_384.531_4.34.wav_ASR	you know when i look around and i see a lot of people who know
kansas05a_389.118_1.34.wav_ASR	you know they go with their all around here
kansas05a_390.473_0.99.wav_ASR	you know and talk to people
kansas05a_391.485_2.95.wav_ASR	and people have differentproblems
kansas05a_394.676_3.96.wav_ASR	you know i have no problems with my eating my legs you know and all that
kansas05a_398.681_2.2.wav_ASR	i don't have any problems particular
kansas05a_401.308_2.97.wav_ASR	as time on got on i hadta get better
kansas05a_405.255_6.03.wav_ASR	but now where was i going
kansas05a_411.561_1.63.wav_ASR	what were you asking me again
kansas05a_420.085_1.64.wav_ASR	oh yes
kansas05a_422.593_9.96.wav_ASR	where i'm working toward having more more
kansas05a_434.918_3.07.wav_ASR	as time goes on i learn more and more what to do
kansas05a_439.556_1.65.wav_ASR	and so that's what i'm doing
kansas05a_467.065_0.97.wav_ASR	so they come different
kansas05a_468.95_4.67.wav_ASR	so tell me the story with a beginning a middle and an end
kansas05a_473.861_0.95.wav_ASR	with each one
kansas05a_480.821_2.29.wav_ASR	so each one of these i'm sposta do something with it
kansas05a_483.43_0.79.wav_ASR	is that what you're saying
kansas05a_497.343_0.77.wav_ASR	thank you
kansas05a_504.475_17.939.wav_ASR	well the first one is learning through this this this mess
kansas05a_529.355_7.84.wav_ASR	it's a a problem
kansas05a_540.213_11.2.wav_ASR	that's a aor a cereal
kansas05a_554.453_7.16.wav_ASR	there's a friend eating working with that this one
kansas05a_563.678_3.27.wav_ASR	because these three people are making a problem
kansas05a_580.09_0.63.wav_ASR	four what is that
kansas05a_589.826_1.82.wav_ASR	oh well that's kind of dumb stuff
kansas05a_593.266_2.41.wav_ASR	i think that takes a little work to make that look right
kansas05a_596.395_2.36.wav_ASR	okay i'm sposta
kansas05a_600.809_1.48.wav_ASR	four what am i sposta do with this one
kansas05a_603.491_0.94.wav_ASR	what's it
kansas05a_605.0_1.13.wav_ASR	four did the window break
kansas05a_608.523_1.45.wav_ASR	okay well that's four it then
kansas05a_643.723_19.47.wav_ASR	so the the first person is a problem there
kansas05a_666.113_5.28.wav_ASR	two then the second one would be
kansas05a_674.141_4.53.wav_ASR	looking at the tear tins
kansas05a_681.195_14.69.wav_ASR	and and two believing that the second people should
kansas05a_702.031_0.71.wav_ASR	i think so
kansas05a_703.736_3.14.wav_ASR	two he he's not sposta do that for him
kansas05a_708.008_3.8.wav_ASR	this one guy wants two the these bins to come down now
kansas05a_712.325_1.15.wav_ASR	or he wants picture three them by himself
kansas05a_715.293_1.03.wav_ASR	well that's not quite right but four
kansas05a_718.205_0.34.wav_ASR	what
kansas05a_719.0_0.38.wav_ASR	which one
kansas05a_721.863_10.62.wav_ASR	there he's looking out a fort on the the the the the cheers on how to deal with those things
kansas05a_732.528_5.87.wav_ASR	and the four old stuff that that's being afraid there
kansas05a_740.616_16.13.wav_ASR	there five the the the mother is not not happy with her her person of what went all the the little problems that they look here together
kansas05a_759.633_4.72.wav_ASR	six well they then he was back there again
kansas05a_764.921_0.88.wav_ASR	oh i see six
kansas05a_766.03_12.56.wav_ASR	six his mother wanted him to go back to the good stuff he was done before so that he can go back onto this six this kind of stuff again that makes him look better
kansas05a_779.24_4.95.wav_ASR	he goes back and the idea's that he's six gotten make them go back and look look better
kansas05a_812.463_2.81.wav_ASR	well i guess you'd start with that
kansas05a_819.976_6.9.wav_ASR	people sitting with their their their their their stuff around it
kansas05a_827.928_1.1.wav_ASR	on to his
kansas05a_831.043_4.35.wav_ASR	against the the kind of thispeople there
kansas05a_837.143_11.29.wav_ASR	well let's see there's the the man who's trying to talk with him about that back over to that kind of stuff
kansas05a_848.486_4.42.wav_ASR	it was going to be overly cared by this younger stuff
kansas05a_854.133_3.71.wav_ASR	this is big enough to make that kind of stuff
kansas05a_859.378_4.24.wav_ASR	then there'd be this thing that doesn't really
kansas05a_864.8_5.88.wav_ASR	this isn't necessarily what's going on here but it's there
kansas05a_872.161_11.16.wav_ASR	here's the the the leaf the person wants the early one
kansas05a_888.045_3.84.wav_ASR	the the personputting this stuff together

kurland04b_195.1_0.33.wav_ASR	yeah
kurland04b_195.728_8.15.wav_ASR	it it was about christmas time and i hadta be two or three or maybe four
kurland04b_204.418_9.37.wav_ASR	but and i'm not sure whether i remember this or people were telling it so often that i remember it
kurland04b_214.256_6.46.wav_ASR	but my father useta buy all three of his daughters a christmas dress
kurland04b_221.109_3.59.wav_ASR	and he would wrap them and put put them under the tree
kurland04b_225.267_2.31.wav_ASR	and somebody was saying
kurland04b_227.736_3.29.wav_ASR	this is firstname b's up this is firstname c's up and this is firstname's up
kurland04b_231.601_11.49.wav_ASR	and so you know he kept telling which which which package was whose
kurland04b_243.417_4.24.wav_ASR	and so later on i found my package
kurland04b_247.966_3.49.wav_ASR	and i undid it and put the dress on
kurland04b_274.187_0.59.wav_ASR	okay
kurland04b_275.784_3.38.wav_ASR	there was a boy playing soccer
kurland04b_279.21_1.19.wav_ASR	and he kicked the ball
kurland04b_280.601_3.34.wav_ASR	and the ball went through the window
kurland04b_285.546_0.94.wav_ASR	he was outside
kurland04b_286.501_2.07.wav_ASR	he kicked the ball inside
kurland04b_289.17_4.27.wav_ASR	and it it it knocked over a lamp
kurland04b_294.053_5.06.wav_ASR	and his father was angry
kurland04b_300.412_1.58.wav_ASR	and i don't know what's going on here
kurland04b_302.676_5.89.wav_ASR	he picked up the ball and looked through the hole at his son
kurland04b_324.62_0.7.wav_ASR	okay
kurland04b_325.478_5.62.wav_ASR	a boy was leaving his house
kurland04b_332.737_2.95.wav_ASR	and his mother wanted him to take the umbrella
kurland04b_335.708_1.08.wav_ASR	and he said no
kurland04b_337.284_1.26.wav_ASR	so he left
kurland04b_339.461_2.31.wav_ASR	his mother wasn't too pleased
kurland04b_342.508_3.26.wav_ASR	and while he was walking to school it started to rain
kurland04b_346.492_1.52.wav_ASR	so he ran back home
kurland04b_348.069_5.04.wav_ASR	and his mother saw him and and saw that he was wet
kurland04b_353.882_7.11.wav_ASR	and he got the umbrella and walked back to school with the umbrella
kurland04b_374.405_13.31.wav_ASR	a man was trying to get the cat out of the tree
kurland04b_388.147_1.2.wav_ASR	he had a ladder
kurland04b_389.936_2.71.wav_ASR	and he climbed up on to the branch
kurland04b_392.665_2.29.wav_ASR	and the ladder fell over
kurland04b_395.678_2.92.wav_ASR	and someone called the fire department
kurland04b_399.132_5.21.wav_ASR	and the fire department came and got him out of the tree
kurland04b_411.534_0.48.wav_ASR	mhm
kurland04b_418.783_0.42.wav_ASR	okay
kurland04b_501.28_0.938.wav_ASR	okay okay
kurland04b_502.933_10.18.wav_ASR	cinderella's father married a woman who had two children
kurland04b_514.207_23.16.wav_ASR	and so the her cinderella's two stepsisters and her stepmother made cinderella clean up after everything
kurland04b_537.717_2.96.wav_ASR	she hadta wash the floor
kurland04b_576.021_10.95.wav_ASR	and so the the two stepsisters weren't gonna allow cinderella to come
kurland04b_588.209_21.45.wav_ASR	so after they left for the ball cinderella's fairy godmother came and wished her into a a pretty ball gown
kurland04b_610.285_3.9.wav_ASR	and the pumpkin pumpkin changed into a carriage
kurland04b_614.697_6.21.wav_ASR	and the mice mice turned into the horses
kurland04b_621.488_7.74.wav_ASR	and her fairy godmother told her she hadta be back home by midnight
kurland04b_629.955_4.56.wav_ASR	and so she went in the the carriage
kurland04b_636.078_5.33.wav_ASR	and at the ball she met the prince
kurland04b_641.783_1.09.wav_ASR	and they dance
kurland04b_643.405_4.44.wav_ASR	and then the clock chimed twelve
kurland04b_648.219_3.82.wav_ASR	and cinderella ran away
kurland04b_652.338_6.83.wav_ASR	and as she ran away her one of her glass slippers fell
kurland04b_659.969_1.51.wav_ASR	and the prince picked it up
kurland04b_663.127_2.45.wav_ASR	and so then he he
kurland04b_665.948_6.29.wav_ASR	it was the only way that he could find her was through the the glass slipper
kurland04b_672.358_3.3.wav_ASR	so he went to everyone's house
kurland04b_676.494_9.98.wav_ASR	and at cinderella's house her stepsisters had locked her in a room
kurland04b_686.985_3.17.wav_ASR	and the mice came and gave her the key
kurland04b_691.051_8.14.wav_ASR	and then the prince tried the slipper on the two stepsisters
kurland04b_699.268_6.01.wav_ASR	and their feet were too big for the the glass slipper
kurland04b_705.772_6.16.wav_ASR	and then cinderella came out of the the closet or the room
kurland04b_711.953_4.78.wav_ASR	and the glass glass slipper fit her
kurland04b_717.438_7.39.wav_ASR	and the prince and cinderella were lived happily ever after
kurland04b_737.783_0.71.wav_ASR	okay
kurland04b_739.13_3.31.wav_ASR	i would get two pieces of bread
kurland04b_743.279_3.94.wav_ASR	and i would get out the peanut butter and the jelly
kurland04b_747.695_7.73.wav_ASR	and then i would spread one slice with peanut butter and the other slice with jelly
kurland04b_756.291_5.4.wav_ASR	then i would put the two pieces together
kurland04b_762.256_2.42.wav_ASR	and cut it
kurland04b_764.991_0.62.wav_ASR	and eat it
kurland04b_770.477_0.39.wav_ASR	wow
kurland04b_771.798_0.74.wav_ASR	oh you're welcome
kurland05a_152.51_11.42.wav_ASR	well if i hadta you know say i was a ten before the stroke i'd say probably maybe a five or six you know post stroke
kurland05a_170.84_0.89.wav_ASR	oh yeah very well
kurland05a_173.8_2.07.wav_ASR	yeah it was a sunday afternoon
kurland05a_176.666_5.67.wav_ASR	and i i went for a ride in my truck with my my littlest my my boy
kurland05a_182.382_2.67.wav_ASR	he was about fifteen years old then
kurland05a_185.106_6.18.wav_ASR	he had down syndrome so he wasn't fifteen probably like four or five you know
kurland05a_191.809_0.48.wav_ASR	mentally
kurland05a_193.024_1.21.wav_ASR	and we we went for a ride
kurland05a_194.282_4.53.wav_ASR	and during the ride something you know came over me
kurland05a_198.988_5.04.wav_ASR	and you know i i couldn't think straight
kurland05a_204.622_1.36.wav_ASR	and i i'll never forget
kurland05a_206.0_7.82.wav_ASR	i i was weakened on my right side my my right hand hand my right leg
kurland05a_214.253_10.25.wav_ASR	and as it turned out my speech was about about about two on a scale of one to ten maybe even a one
kurland05a_224.887_1.16.wav_ASR	and then i came home
kurland05a_226.186_1.23.wav_ASR	and i i went in the house
kurland05a_227.514_1.77.wav_ASR	and i sat down
kurland05a_229.301_2.07.wav_ASR	it was about three o'clock three thirty
kurland05a_233.454_3.19.wav_ASR	and side of table i was sitting in the chair excuse me
kurland05a_236.666_2.23.wav_ASR	and and on the left i kept my phone side of table
kurland05a_239.553_2.92.wav_ASR	my wife was sitting about fifteen feet away
kurland05a_242.497_0.96.wav_ASR	and the phone rang
kurland05a_243.476_2.08.wav_ASR	and i knew i had something wrong
kurland05a_245.637_2.84.wav_ASR	so i i grabbed the phone
kurland05a_248.5_4.2.wav_ASR	i i couldn't even get you know anything more than you know hello out
kurland05a_253.449_5.039.wav_ASR	and the person on the phone i i i to this day i i i don't know who it was but she said
kurland05a_258.926_0.77.wav_ASR	firstname are you alright
kurland05a_259.718_0.4.wav_ASR	and i said
kurland05a_260.801_1.56.wav_ASR	no i something something's wrong
kurland05a_262.38_1.63.wav_ASR	and she said
kurland05a_264.131_0.78.wav_ASR	i think you had a stroke
kurland05a_265.201_4.64.wav_ASR	and you know so she asked for for my wife
kurland05a_271.108_7.69.wav_ASR	i i hadn't talked to my wife you know because i didn't want her to know that i was you know not feeling right
kurland05a_279.654_5.22.wav_ASR	so i thought it would go away to you know continue to go to work and everything like that
kurland05a_285.064_4.19.wav_ASR	but so we went to the hospital
kurland05a_290.627_4.48.wav_ASR	we went to the hospital monday
kurland05a_295.586_1.9.wav_ASR	i tried going to work on on monday
kurland05a_298.262_0.91.wav_ASR	i i don't know why but i
kurland05a_300.327_6.55.wav_ASR	and i i drove my truck from hadley massachusetts the way up to chad new york
kurland05a_307.424_2.24.wav_ASR	it's about eighty miles away
kurland05a_310.553_6.46.wav_ASR	and on the way out it kept drifting to the right right you know
kurland05a_317.918_3.01.wav_ASR	you know the rubber strips you know on the interstate
kurland05a_321.108_4.34.wav_ASR	i went off the road down in simsbury connecticut right up on the sidewalk
kurland05a_326.11_8.58.wav_ASR	and at that point there i decided i i got something wrong with me you know more than you know a good night's sleep is gonna you know cure
kurland05a_335.758_3.8.wav_ASR	so i i went home and that's that's the day i told my wife
kurland05a_340.564_1.36.wav_ASR	sunday i didn't say anything
kurland05a_342.93_1.48.wav_ASR	on monday i told my wife
kurland05a_344.754_2.02.wav_ASR	you know and i went to the hospital
kurland05a_346.798_14.85.wav_ASR	and you know since it was already you know a whole day you know i found out that if you go to to the doctor's within three hours of you know your stroke they have a chance to change the course or you know reverse it whatever
kurland05a_362.512_4.01.wav_ASR	anyways the horses are out of the barn by the time i said anything
kurland05a_367.407_2.24.wav_ASR	and i took the m r is
kurland05a_369.736_4.53.wav_ASR	and you know i went through speech therapy and you know
kurland05a_375.33_1.04.wav_ASR	there's two other types of
kurland05a_376.429_0.74.wav_ASR	i'm trying to think
kurland05a_377.191_1.66.wav_ASR	but those lasted a very short time
kurland05a_378.867_3.56.wav_ASR	but speech therapy you know lasted like three or four months
kurland05a_383.2_3.25.wav_ASR	and finally my therapist said you know
kurland05a_386.799_2.27.wav_ASR	i think you've reached the your plateau firstname
kurland05a_389.246_3.71.wav_ASR	and and you know i was released
kurland05a_393.01_3.82.wav_ASR	and and pretty much you know she was right
kurland05a_396.85_2.72.wav_ASR	it i i plateaued you know after six months
kurland05a_399.661_4.34.wav_ASR	and now it's six and a half years later and i'm still plateaued
kurland05a_421.506_4.57.wav_ASR	well one thing that's was quite clear i was very tired
kurland05a_426.134_3.9.wav_ASR	so i useta get like six hours sleep at night you know when i was working
kurland05a_430.627_6.75.wav_ASR	i probably went to nine hours you know and with a a nap in the afternoon for like a half an hour
kurland05a_439.185_11.7.wav_ASR	i in my therapy you know i i told here my therapist you know i was a salesman you know in a prior life you know prior the to the stroke
kurland05a_450.9_1.92.wav_ASR	and she tried to help me with with that
kurland05a_453.377_9.07.wav_ASR	and the only way i could really function i could use the cue cards card you know you know for for what i was gonna say
kurland05a_463.012_4.16.wav_ASR	or i could have written on paper you know like like canned speech
kurland05a_467.738_5.68.wav_ASR	but i i i was not able to really talk you know like one on one like you're you and i are doing right now
kurland05a_475.53_10.57.wav_ASR	just the best way i can describe things if if i was a thirty five r p m record you know i was trying to talk to a seventy eight r p m record you know
kurland05a_486.35_2.39.wav_ASR	i just couldn't get on the same wave wavelength
kurland05a_489.477_14.42.wav_ASR	and it it's not quite so bad you know individually but when i talk to a a bunch of people in a a noisy room and just you know noise from all directions i just wanna be out of the scene
kurland05a_504.51_7.96.wav_ASR	very much like downstairs there's there's too many people and i just feel you know awkward talking
kurland05a_515.462_0.671.wav_ASR	it's getting bigger
kurland05a_554.732_7.46.wav_ASR	well i have had many things happen but i'll tell you one that that involves my stroke
kurland05a_564.856_3.3.wav_ASR	my stroke took place april fourth
kurland05a_568.92_6.03.wav_ASR	and my fiscal year ended october first you know for my selling and stuff
kurland05a_575.71_0.86.wav_ASR	and anyways i said
kurland05a_576.684_1.21.wav_ASR	well may june july
kurland05a_578.401_1.34.wav_ASR	i had like five months to go
kurland05a_579.76_4.27.wav_ASR	and i i had done all of my categories
kurland05a_584.704_4.17.wav_ASR	so i i i won a trip to caro springs
kurland05a_589.765_1.96.wav_ASR	and and i had a stroke
kurland05a_592.346_2.85.wav_ASR	and anyways my my wife didn't wanna go
kurland05a_595.53_1.56.wav_ASR	but i took my oldest son
kurland05a_601.36_2.91.wav_ASR	and moment and that brings me to to another thing
kurland05a_604.371_11.19.wav_ASR	when i got up to accept the the award i i started crying
kurland05a_622.298_0.93.wav_ASR	and that's another thing
kurland05a_624.482_0.93.wav_ASR	i never useta cry
kurland05a_630.564_8.41.wav_ASR	but you know it's just something that they say that that added benefit or a loss whatever that came along with the stroke
kurland05a_639.446_6.27.wav_ASR	and that's you know as you can see it's continued to stay with me
kurland05a_649.2_2.38.wav_ASR	yeah it's crazy yeah
kurland05a_653.67_4.13.wav_ASR	i can hear amazing grace at a funeral and
kurland05a_662.527_0.85.wav_ASR	don't ask me why
kurland05a_666.225_1.64.wav_ASR	yeah it's very weird
kurland05a_668.408_6.34.wav_ASR	because you know i'd be able to be cracking a joke for me or something during you know you know the playing of amazing grace
kurland05a_674.801_6.03.wav_ASR	but you know it you know it's just very very awkward
kurland05a_685.515_3.9.wav_ASR	well it it happens too too often
kurland05a_690.856_2.46.wav_ASR	and you know watching a tv show you know
kurland05a_695.249_3.53.wav_ASR	it might be something stupid like the bachelorette you know
kurland05a_700.718_10.62.wav_ASR	if i come in and my wife's watching a show and you know if they have a little sentimental scene whatever you know i look over at her and she's sitting there and i'm i'm crying
kurland05a_712.137_5.12.wav_ASR	and i don't like the show anyways but you know i can't get over it you know
kurland05a_717.971_2.22.wav_ASR	it's it's it's very dumb
kurland05a_722.507_2.3.wav_ASR	well a a bunch of my female friends said
kurland05a_725.084_2.06.wav_ASR	well it makes you a cuter guy
kurland05a_727.159_0.59.wav_ASR	whatever
kurland05a_736.401_0.79.wav_ASR	so now you know
kurland05a_767.64_0.42.wav_ASR	alright
kurland05a_768.713_6.43.wav_ASR	well this comes right home to roost because i played soccer for for umass
kurland05a_775.731_4.04.wav_ASR	and the first picture shows a a young guy playing soccer
kurland05a_780.772_0.81.wav_ASR	he kicks the ball
kurland05a_781.6_6.34.wav_ASR	and he must be too close to the house because he put the ball right through the window
kurland05a_789.212_6.9.wav_ASR	and as luck would have it the homeowner was sitting right by the window that got smashed
kurland05a_796.131_4.91.wav_ASR	and he knocked knocked the lamp over and smashed the window
kurland05a_801.46_2.26.wav_ASR	so he did considerable damage i guess
kurland05a_804.612_7.97.wav_ASR	and the last picture shows the homeowner you know holding the soccer ball and looking at the guy
kurland05a_812.6_5.26.wav_ASR	so i can only imagine what happened on the fifth picture if there was one
kurland05a_855.661_3.73.wav_ASR	well i guess it shows a woman and probably her son
kurland05a_860.063_1.44.wav_ASR	and he wants to go outside i guess
kurland05a_862.307_0.51.wav_ASR	and she says
kurland05a_862.998_2.06.wav_ASR	take your umbrella you know before you go
kurland05a_865.108_1.27.wav_ASR	and he's he didn't wanna take it
kurland05a_867.751_2.56.wav_ASR	and she offered it to him twice i guess
kurland05a_870.393_1.62.wav_ASR	and he still didn't take it
kurland05a_872.035_0.74.wav_ASR	he goes outside
kurland05a_872.828_3.42.wav_ASR	and the third picture shows him getting drenched
kurland05a_876.326_4.09.wav_ASR	and the the fourth picture shows him getting drenched even worse you know
kurland05a_882.162_1.98.wav_ASR	so he comes back inside soaking wet
kurland05a_884.93_0.85.wav_ASR	and the mother says
kurland05a_885.939_0.89.wav_ASR	i probably told you so
kurland05a_886.879_5.12.wav_ASR	and the last picture shows him with a umbrella like he shoulda had in the first place
kurland05a_903.958_0.5.wav_ASR	alright
kurland05a_916.499_3.08.wav_ASR	well evidently the cat climbed the tree
kurland05a_919.6_3.77.wav_ASR	and as cats are prone to do it couldn't get down from the tree
kurland05a_925.566_9.21.wav_ASR	and a homeowner or somebody you know a male tried to get up the tree and he couldn't get the cat down either
kurland05a_936.567_1.42.wav_ASR	the girl's crying for her cat
kurland05a_939.74_3.82.wav_ASR	oh the reason the guy can't get down is because his ladder fell down
kurland05a_944.348_0.99.wav_ASR	so he's stuck in the tree
kurland05a_945.353_5.63.wav_ASR	and the dog you know barked at the cat and the the guy in the tree
kurland05a_951.07_3.66.wav_ASR	so i guess we know why the cat is up in the tree
kurland05a_955.677_6.53.wav_ASR	and anyways way to the right it shows the fire department coming to get the cat down from the tree and the guy
kurland05a_965.049_1.31.wav_ASR	this this is this wanted
kurland05a_992.053_3.05.wav_ASR	well my son watched cinderella quite often
kurland05a_997.143_0.83.wav_ASR	he he watches
kurland05a_998.255_3.97.wav_ASR	he he watches all all the disney movies you know over and over again
kurland05a_1003.251_2.88.wav_ASR	and i i mean over and over again not once or twice i mean
kurland05a_1008.346_1.36.wav_ASR	forty fifty times yeah
kurland05a_1011.908_1.15.wav_ASR	i know most of them yeah
kurland05a_1016.878_9.9.wav_ASR	well i i watched so many movies with him cinderella might might involve some other story too but
kurland05a_1041.624_0.32.wav_ASR	okay
kurland05a_1045.64_1.219.wav_ASR	it won't take long
kurland05a_1049.637_0.39.wav_ASR	oh yeah
kurland05a_1129.285_5.26.wav_ASR	i'm gonna give you my version and it's gonna be very short
kurland05a_1136.092_2.46.wav_ASR	but it starts off with a young girl
kurland05a_1138.93_1.73.wav_ASR	i think she has two sisters maybe
kurland05a_1140.678_8.22.wav_ASR	and she's the least favorite of of of of the the three even though she's the you know the knockout of the three
kurland05a_1150.4_1.95.wav_ASR	her mother's even worse
kurland05a_1152.368_6.1.wav_ASR	you know i i compare her with the evil stepmother almost
kurland05a_1159.027_3.22.wav_ASR	anyways don't laugh
kurland05a_1163.206_2.53.wav_ASR	anyways she wanted to go to the ball
kurland05a_1165.752_0.99.wav_ASR	and she couldn't go to the ball
kurland05a_1166.764_5.58.wav_ASR	but somehow she got it to go to the ball
kurland05a_1172.459_3.71.wav_ASR	and anyways at at the ball there was a prince there
kurland05a_1177.292_2.11.wav_ASR	and i think he had a slipper
kurland05a_1179.426_3.52.wav_ASR	and he tried the slipper on the every every girl there
kurland05a_1183.783_5.14.wav_ASR	and as luck would have it cinderella you know fit into the shoe
kurland05a_1190.594_3.78.wav_ASR	and anyways i hope i'm telling it right
kurland05a_1194.524_3.16.wav_ASR	so i think you know they're happy ever after
kurland05a_1201.033_0.43.wav_ASR	the end
kurland05a_1220.688_0.84.wav_ASR	that's pretty easy
kurland05a_1222.699_3.27.wav_ASR	i would take the bread out of the icebox
kurland05a_1227.109_5.61.wav_ASR	and i use only arnold's whole grain breads because that's healthier for my son
kurland05a_1234.237_4.55.wav_ASR	i can tell you this because i've been making lunches for like six months now
kurland05a_1239.613_1.78.wav_ASR	and every tuesday he has a peanut butter and jelly sandwich
kurland05a_1241.442_5.12.wav_ASR	but anyways i get him two pieces of whole grain bread
kurland05a_1247.075_1.39.wav_ASR	lay them on the the table
kurland05a_1249.538_2.64.wav_ASR	and on one i put the grape jelly
kurland05a_1252.921_0.81.wav_ASR	he loves grape
kurland05a_1254.656_4.23.wav_ASR	and then i put skippy smooth spread on the other side
kurland05a_1259.156_3.63.wav_ASR	and i put the pieces of bread together
kurland05a_1262.831_7.23.wav_ASR	and i cut him four pieces because i don't want him to you knowonto a sandwich that's too big
kurland05a_1270.32_5.5.wav_ASR	and then i have little bags that i you know put it in
kurland05a_1275.84_2.65.wav_ASR	and then i i close the the sandwich in the bag
kurland05a_1278.506_3.21.wav_ASR	and i'm ready to go
kurland05b_50.075_4.4.wav_ASR	my speech is as i've just said it's probably you know
kurland05b_56.5_10.98.wav_ASR	if if if like in a range of one to ten with ten being you know prior to my stroke it probably ranges from like a a three or four to a seven
kurland05b_68.384_18.84.wav_ASR	and depending on you know how much sleep i had and you know what i did the day before and you know how i feel and you know it can vary like i say you know on the high side like of like a seven or you know down as low as a three or four
kurland05b_97.474_0.39.wav_ASR	oh yeah ex
kurland05b_101.171_8.37.wav_ASR	my stroke occurred on a sunday april third i think it was
kurland05b_110.667_3.95.wav_ASR	april third or april fourth in the afternoon
kurland05b_115.886_5.05.wav_ASR	i was taking my son firstnamek for a ride in the truck
kurland05b_121.942_7.89.wav_ASR	and sometime during the ride about you know an hour ride i just didn't feel very good
kurland05b_131.038_7.6.wav_ASR	and when i say i i didn't feel good i didn't feel up to snuff
kurland05b_138.764_4.16.wav_ASR	and i i knew something was wrong but i was hoping it was just temporary
kurland05b_144.024_7.14.wav_ASR	so not to alarm my wife i didn't say anything to my wife the rest of sunday
kurland05b_151.185_2.78.wav_ASR	and you know that night i went to bed early
kurland05b_153.981_3.23.wav_ASR	and next morning's monday
kurland05b_158.031_2.08.wav_ASR	i went to work you know like normal
kurland05b_161.057_5.69.wav_ASR	and driving to work because my right side was affected
kurland05b_166.826_2.53.wav_ASR	i had a left side stroke so my right side was affected
kurland05b_169.989_2.67.wav_ASR	i kept drifting off the side of the road
kurland05b_173.568_4.83.wav_ASR	i got on the mass pike from springfield to new york state
kurland05b_179.316_1.64.wav_ASR	and i kept going over the rumble strip
kurland05b_182.108_9.76.wav_ASR	and then i i knew i couldn't talk to anybody because they it like i i i knew it but just had something wrong with my speech and you know my verbal thing
kurland05b_191.892_5.03.wav_ASR	so i i picked up some corn seed that i sold these two farmers
kurland05b_196.973_3.33.wav_ASR	and i got the corn seed on my truck
kurland05b_200.538_0.84.wav_ASR	forty bags
kurland05b_201.657_1.03.wav_ASR	and then i came back
kurland05b_203.698_3.23.wav_ASR	and then i got off in westfield
kurland05b_207.883_1.73.wav_ASR	and i drove down to simsbury connecticut
kurland05b_210.089_2.3.wav_ASR	and the same thing happened down there
kurland05b_212.464_1.61.wav_ASR	i was going off the right
kurland05b_215.133_5.91.wav_ASR	down in simsbury i went right up on a sidewalk with with my truck
kurland05b_221.891_4.39.wav_ASR	at that point i i figured something's really you know drastically wrong
kurland05b_226.335_2.1.wav_ASR	so i i went home
kurland05b_229.055_2.63.wav_ASR	and about two o'clock i was home
kurland05b_231.708_2.62.wav_ASR	and i was sitting in the sunroom
kurland05b_234.375_2.94.wav_ASR	and the phone rang
kurland05b_237.33_1.8.wav_ASR	and i i was sitting like here
kurland05b_239.747_1.31.wav_ASR	you know the phone was right here
kurland05b_241.287_2.06.wav_ASR	my wife was like twelve feet away
kurland05b_244.599_0.87.wav_ASR	and i answered the phone
kurland05b_245.491_5.89.wav_ASR	and i i i think i said helloq and maybe you know one or two other words
kurland05b_251.454_3.41.wav_ASR	and who other person was on the line said
kurland05b_256.869_0.559.wav_ASR	firstname what's wrong
kurland05b_258.3_6.88.wav_ASR	and it was a female a friend of my wife's
kurland05b_266.088_0.42.wav_ASR	and she said
kurland05b_266.653_0.63.wav_ASR	i think you had a stroke
kurland05b_267.375_0.45.wav_ASR	so she said
kurland05b_268.156_0.55.wav_ASR	put your wife on
kurland05b_268.782_0.81.wav_ASR	so i said you know
kurland05b_269.867_0.57.wav_ASR	here firstnamem
kurland05b_271.723_3.86.wav_ASR	and then my wife was flabbergasted that i had you know the problem i did
kurland05b_275.899_1.1.wav_ASR	so we went to the hospital
kurland05b_277.016_4.1.wav_ASR	and you know they determined i had a stroke
kurland05b_281.136_4.44.wav_ASR	but it was you know over three hours so the cat was already out of the bag
kurland05b_293.567_4.82.wav_ASR	well i went to speech therapy and occupational therapy and physical therapy
kurland05b_298.403_8.73.wav_ASR	and the the p t and the the occupational therapy probably went to like three or four sessions each
kurland05b_307.193_2.73.wav_ASR	and they you know they said
kurland05b_310.082_0.64.wav_ASR	you're okay
kurland05b_310.745_2.93.wav_ASR	you know you know i was throwing a ball
kurland05b_313.825_2.57.wav_ASR	i remember the i was throwing a like a rubber ball
kurland05b_318.388_3.05.wav_ASR	i was catching a ball better with my right hand than my left hand
kurland05b_321.457_1.7.wav_ASR	so she said you know
kurland05b_323.705_0.63.wav_ASR	you're recovered
kurland05b_324.657_3.95.wav_ASR	and then the speech therapy must have gone to that for probably three months
kurland05b_333.208_9.89.wav_ASR	and you know like i say if i was like a three level when i started you know i i maybe i came up to like you know a seven or eight level whatever
kurland05b_343.549_1.79.wav_ASR	but i kind of like plateaued
kurland05b_346.177_4.96.wav_ASR	and that's that at that time there you know my my speech therapist lorie corrs said you know
kurland05b_352.43_0.71.wav_ASR	you plateaued
kurland05b_353.164_2.95.wav_ASR	you know so i i stopped going to therapy
kurland05b_356.174_4.04.wav_ASR	she she was right

kurland05b_387.861_3.22.wav_ASR	you know i i i was a pretty good salesman not to brag
kurland05b_391.097_4.98.wav_ASR	but you know i i became project manager you know with the the company i worked for
kurland05b_396.1_1.46.wav_ASR	and
kurland05b_401.115_6.28.wav_ASR	i'll tell you after i had the stroke i continued to work it's because my year ended in october first
kurland05b_408.444_4.29.wav_ASR	and i went to a meeting out in new york state

kurland05b_432.845_1.68.wav_ASR	and here i i was sposta be the expert
kurland05b_435.581_2.4.wav_ASR	and i i i'll never forget that
kurland05b_438.0_1.17.wav_ASR	it was really embarrassing
kurland05b_440.451_5.79.wav_ASR	you know i i i don't grasp as much as i as useta grasp you know as far as you know studying stuff
kurland05b_448.71_3.71.wav_ASR	just the other day you know like two weeks ago i i bartend

kurland05b_473.683_3.87.wav_ASR	and you know some of those people that were there for for the first time only
kurland05b_478.908_4.73.wav_ASR	so it's again it's you know it's not the you know the same as i was before
kurland05b_486.315_0.97.wav_ASR	but you know you just live with that
kurland05b_487.3_0.41.wav_ASR	so
kurland05b_521.35_5.4.wav_ASR	i'll just tell you the first story that popped in my mind
kurland05b_528.086_12.14.wav_ASR	when i was in second grade you know a little kid so i was probably what eight years old seven years old i entered a contest sponsored by by channel twenty two
kurland05b_541.171_8.04.wav_ASR	anyways it was some kind of a contest put on by some western tv show

kurland05b_558.463_2.43.wav_ASR	and we went up there
kurland05b_562.292_2.8.wav_ASR	and my father you know we had a good time
kurland05b_565.11_1.13.wav_ASR	but my father was like
kurland05b_566.959_0.5.wav_ASR	we got up there
kurland05b_567.474_5.55.wav_ASR	and the guy that was our our guide for the day he he was a drunk
kurland05b_573.948_2.22.wav_ASR	he he could smell booze on his breath you know
kurland05b_577.382_0.79.wav_ASR	i'll never forget that
kurland05b_578.302_2.27.wav_ASR	but we had a good time
kurland05b_582.487_1.86.wav_ASR	you know take it off as it rides
kurland05b_584.365_5.0.wav_ASR	he gave me a toy gun and stuff
kurland05b_589.647_1.44.wav_ASR	you know it's it's kind of neat
kurland05b_591.776_2.55.wav_ASR	like i said that's that's a long time ago though
kurland05b_624.232_0.39.wav_ASR	okay
kurland05b_628.176_4.47.wav_ASR	well little johnny's playing soccer or kickball out in his front yard
kurland05b_632.7_2.8.wav_ASR	and he kicks the ball too hard
kurland05b_635.545_6.32.wav_ASR	and unfortunately it goes through the the window of either his house or the neighbor's house
kurland05b_642.769_3.78.wav_ASR	it lands in the probably the living room
kurland05b_646.929_1.83.wav_ASR	it knocks over a lamp and smashes that
kurland05b_649.915_2.18.wav_ASR	and the guy who owns the house is sitting right next to the lamp
kurland05b_653.528_0.75.wav_ASR	so johnny's caught
kurland05b_655.706_1.96.wav_ASR	and he looks outside
kurland05b_657.905_0.67.wav_ASR	and he's holding the ball
kurland05b_658.598_2.16.wav_ASR	and he gets the
kurland05b_661.683_0.79.wav_ASR	johnny's in trouble
kurland05b_675.398_0.57.wav_ASR	ah
kurland05b_688.437_3.84.wav_ASR	well again little johnny's probably going to school
kurland05b_692.452_0.73.wav_ASR	and his ma said
kurland05b_693.436_0.72.wav_ASR	take an umbrella

kurland05b_696.756_1.71.wav_ASR	nah no it's it's gonna be fine
kurland05b_698.991_1.28.wav_ASR	so he leaves the umbrella home
kurland05b_701.547_4.48.wav_ASR	and his mother's right on this occasion anyways because it starts raining
kurland05b_707.255_1.58.wav_ASR	and little johnny gets soaking wet
kurland05b_709.681_0.62.wav_ASR	he comes home
kurland05b_710.322_2.75.wav_ASR	and he's all wet
kurland05b_713.094_1.1.wav_ASR	and his mother scolds him
kurland05b_714.345_3.63.wav_ASR	and next time he goes to school he takes his umbrella with him
kurland05b_744.592_1.132.wav_ASR	oh my god i remember this one yep
kurland05b_755.253_4.52.wav_ASR	well a little girl's probably out riding her tricycle
kurland05b_759.794_2.18.wav_ASR	and her cat comes along
kurland05b_761.996_4.72.wav_ASR	and the dog chases the cat up a tree
kurland05b_768.041_7.81.wav_ASR	and then her father or some older gentleman tries to get the cat down from the tree
kurland05b_776.416_4.18.wav_ASR	and anyways the ladder falls down from the tree so he's stuck too
kurland05b_781.781_5.59.wav_ASR	so then the fire department's coming with a second ladder to get the the guy down and the cat down
kurland05b_796.879_0.58.wav_ASR	oh no
kurland05b_803.106_0.41.wav_ASR	yeah
kurland05b_807.665_0.38.wav_ASR	no
kurland05b_815.154_0.57.wav_ASR	okay
kurland05b_909.402_3.36.wav_ASR	once upon a time there was a girl named cinderella
kurland05b_913.675_7.88.wav_ASR	she had two sisters not very good looking and a evil stepmother i guess
kurland05b_922.524_6.82.wav_ASR	and there was a a ball or something you know a promenade or a a ball or whatever
kurland05b_930.118_7.16.wav_ASR	and the mother and the two girls went to the ball
kurland05b_938.355_5.11.wav_ASR	and they told cinderella to stay home and you know wash the floors because they're they're all dirty
kurland05b_945.465_0.99.wav_ASR	so cinderella stayed home
kurland05b_946.474_3.95.wav_ASR	and i don't know somehow she found a chest or whatever
kurland05b_950.444_4.35.wav_ASR	or something magical happened
kurland05b_955.569_3.66.wav_ASR	and anyways she got to to go to the ball
kurland05b_960.256_15.48.wav_ASR	and in you know in in going to the ball she took a carriage that was made out of a pumpkin you know that was transformed somehow by some fairy or whatever
kurland05b_976.988_3.15.wav_ASR	anyways how am i doing
kurland05b_981.967_7.69.wav_ASR	anyways the the pumpkin or or the the carriage returned back to a pumpkin at midnight
kurland05b_991.035_2.82.wav_ASR	so cinderella hadta make her time you know
kurland05b_994.22_9.66.wav_ASR	and anyways she took off from the ball before midnight so she wouldn't turn into a pumpkin again
kurland05b_1004.309_1.67.wav_ASR	and i guess she lost a slipper
kurland05b_1006.874_2.58.wav_ASR	and while she was there she was dancing with the handsome prince
kurland05b_1009.716_4.87.wav_ASR	and the prince you know got a a hold of the slipper
kurland05b_1014.608_2.97.wav_ASR	and he liked cinderella pretty well
kurland05b_1017.86_5.95.wav_ASR	so he he had a a a shoe fitting
kurland05b_1024.992_3.069.wav_ASR	whoever whoever fit in the shoe would be cinderella
kurland05b_1028.833_4.409.wav_ASR	and anyways cinderella fit unto into the the slipper
kurland05b_1035.181_0.6.wav_ASR	so they got married
kurland05b_1035.799_1.43.wav_ASR	and they live happily ever after
kurland05b_1048.697_0.45.wav_ASR	alright
kurland05b_1055.422_0.45.wav_ASR	okay
kurland05b_1056.34_1.33.wav_ASR	take two pieces of bread
kurland05b_1059.379_1.51.wav_ASR	and you lay them on the table
kurland05b_1061.055_8.55.wav_ASR	and you put skippy peanut butter the smooth version because the the crunchy stuff does not spread so well
kurland05b_1070.403_1.97.wav_ASR	so you lay on it and you put that on the bread
kurland05b_1073.065_1.85.wav_ASR	and that's one half
kurland05b_1074.939_11.48.wav_ASR	and then on the other half i use like raspberry preserves because those make the best peanut butter and jelly sandwiches
kurland05b_1086.976_1.86.wav_ASR	so i lay that on the other piece
kurland05b_1088.915_1.73.wav_ASR	and then i just slap them together
kurland05b_1091.815_1.39.wav_ASR	and i cut it in half
kurland05b_1093.315_1.94.wav_ASR	and there you go

202-2_2403.045_7.97.wav_ASR	but one month i think one month
202-2_2412.315_4.51.wav_ASR	and i'm one month i'm flowering the pot
202-2_2417.585_2.25.wav_ASR	and and that's it
71-1_11.65_2.76.wav_ASR	my goodness
71-1_14.65_0.62.wav_ASR	what would be
71-1_16.35_1.349.wav_ASR	which would be the one to bring up
71-1_17.699_11.7.wav_ASR	you know i can just talk about the nine months really when i was living in copenhagen when i was nineteen
71-1_29.979_4.84.wav_ASR	i did a semester abroad
71-1_38.11_8.87.wav_ASR	back in my generation you could actually go for two semesters which is what i did which is why it was nine months
71-1_47.68_7.67.wav_ASR	but what i did when i got to copenhagen we had this arrangement which you could take classes at the university
71-1_56.18_2.36.wav_ASR	for the first semester i took classes
71-1_59.16_2.453.wav_ASR	and we had classes for four days of the week
71-1_61.8_1.661.wav_ASR	and three days of the week we could travel
71-1_64.1_7.4.wav_ASR	the second semester because i met this woman who became my best friend and it was her idea she said
71-1_71.94_4.16.wav_ASR	you know our education is really holding us back
71-1_76.94_18.32.wav_ASR	so i think what we should do is we should withdraw from the university take our tuition money because we get most of it if you withdraw in the first week and put it in interrails and then just spend the time traveling
71-1_95.93_13.06.wav_ASR	so i would say for those four months in which i actually had a dormitory room that i could go back to when i needed to decompress i got to go ireland greece
71-1_110.29_3.419.wav_ASR	morocco's as far south as we got
71-1_113.771_4.08.wav_ASR	italy france scotland england
71-1_119.131_2.676.wav_ASR	we spent a fair amount of time traveling all over
71-1_121.911_2.231.wav_ASR	when you're nineteen it's a really good time to travel
71-1_124.491_2.854.wav_ASR	really goodlooking boys everywhere that you go
71-1_127.345_11.955.wav_ASR	and yeah i just had the most incredible large vacation despite the fact that my mother said
71-1_139.525_1.2.wav_ASR	you're dropping outta school
71-1_140.804_1.257.wav_ASR	that's terrible
71-1_142.165_0.882.wav_ASR	you will never go back
71-1_143.59_1.381.wav_ASR	no no i'll go back next fall
71-1_144.971_4.28.wav_ASR	but this is my opportunity to really travel a lot
71-1_149.791_2.56.wav_ASR	and you know as my friend firstnamem said to me
71-1_153.351_1.62.wav_ASR	our parents are back in wisconsin
71-1_155.291_0.913.wav_ASR	what are they gonna do
71-1_156.204_0.947.wav_ASR	we're in copenhagen
71-1_157.791_1.89.wav_ASR	we're just gonna tell them what we're doing
71-1_160.22_5.0.wav_ASR	so yeah if i could tell you other stories but they would probably be censored
71-1_165.44_2.1.wav_ASR	so we won't go into all the details
71-1_174.46_3.52.wav_ASR	i'd say it was ireland because i met my family
71-1_178.1_6.44.wav_ASR	my father's family was only two generations from immigrating to the united states
71-1_184.94_5.88.wav_ASR	and they're in brownstone which is in the western county of galway
71-1_191.32_5.02.wav_ASR	and so i got to actually meet with other cousins second cousins
71-1_196.572_2.608.wav_ASR	i'm not sure what the exact relationship is
71-1_199.432_1.95.wav_ASR	but i met people that were part of my family
71-1_201.692_7.006.wav_ASR	and i had uncles or second or third cousins that looked exactly like my father and my uncles
71-1_209.352_4.804.wav_ASR	so yeah that was the most a neat experience long standing i think yeah
71-1_236.89_0.84.wav_ASR	it comes and goes
71-1_238.25_4.65.wav_ASR	i would say that the main problem with my language is that it's unreliable
71-1_243.73_5.13.wav_ASR	as i said a few minutes ago i was talking about going abroad
71-1_249.84_4.21.wav_ASR	and what's interesting is that it's the vowels that i have issues with
71-1_254.46_2.14.wav_ASR	i could not say abroadq
71-1_257.12_1.089.wav_ASR	i think i said abrodeq
71-1_258.58_0.629.wav_ASR	and then i said
71-1_259.68_6.89.wav_ASR	i was really thinking in my brain how to walk around that or figure that out or feel that out on my own
71-1_267.01_2.96.wav_ASR	and i continue to have issues with that
71-1_270.27_1.84.wav_ASR	and i didn't anticipate that happening
71-1_272.61_2.16.wav_ASR	i'm better than i was
71-1_275.11_5.22.wav_ASR	i still have difficulty with complicated concepts
71-1_281.15_1.54.wav_ASR	i'll
71-1_282.906_4.581.wav_ASR	not that i haven't always been confusing to other people
71-1_287.466_3.295.wav_ASR	and i do remember back what it was like when i was teaching before the stroke
71-1_291.106_1.62.wav_ASR	and people would look puzzled
71-1_293.566_0.577.wav_ASR	and then it was like
71-1_294.446_0.82.wav_ASR	well it's their problem
71-1_295.586_5.857.wav_ASR	now when they look puzzled a lot of times i'm pretty sure it's because i said something that didn't make any sense
71-1_301.443_11.647.wav_ASR	so i'm still trying to work on explaining complicated things to people and trying to correct myself when i make a mistake about the others
71-1_313.523_6.04.wav_ASR	and i do continue misspeak on a regular basis
71-1_319.736_1.86.wav_ASR	so it's frustrating
71-1_321.916_8.864.wav_ASR	but i keep practicing it to the point that many people don't think i have aphasia until they do notice that i have aphasia
71-1_331.276_5.44.wav_ASR	so i can communicate but not well and not the way that i useta be able to communicate
71-1_347.09_0.959.wav_ASR	oh very much
71-1_348.131_1.199.wav_ASR	i remember everything about it
71-1_350.191_0.82.wav_ASR	the entire experience
71-1_357.66_4.863.wav_ASR	well i didn't know that it was a stroke which apparently is very typical
71-1_363.04_1.71.wav_ASR	but then i'd never had one before
71-1_364.78_1.964.wav_ASR	so how would i know what a stroke was
71-1_366.88_4.114.wav_ASR	i would elliptical working out
71-1_371.1_1.984.wav_ASR	it was january first
71-1_373.42_4.0.wav_ASR	i figured you know that's the day when the resolution starts
71-1_377.8_1.688.wav_ASR	so i thought i just hafta get out there
71-1_379.52_2.533.wav_ASR	and i need to start working out again harder than i've been
71-1_382.16_0.893.wav_ASR	and i was at a gym
71-1_384.16_2.555.wav_ASR	and i worked the hell out man
71-1_386.84_1.385.wav_ASR	i mean i think i did eight miles
71-1_388.82_3.88.wav_ASR	and my heart rate was my gosh up to like a hundred seventy
71-1_393.18_0.64.wav_ASR	and i'm going
71-1_394.24_0.819.wav_ASR	good keep this up
71-1_395.34_2.9.wav_ASR	and i wasn't tired
71-1_398.62_0.92.wav_ASR	i wasn't fatigued
71-1_400.16_11.482.wav_ASR	i got off the elliptical and had double vision and then decided i would walk for two more miles mostly because the black panther was on
71-1_412.0_1.26.wav_ASR	i don't have cable
71-1_413.3_0.677.wav_ASR	but that was on
71-1_413.977_4.84.wav_ASR	and i thought i wanted to watch it because i really like chadwick boseman
71-1_419.837_1.766.wav_ASR	i was watching that
71-1_422.137_2.144.wav_ASR	and again i had double vision
71-1_425.157_2.023.wav_ASR	so i just didn't feel good anymore
71-1_427.66_7.131.wav_ASR	went home and had a thunder clap headache right on my right side
71-1_434.94_0.52.wav_ASR	and i just said
71-1_435.94_1.381.wav_ASR	wow i have no idea what that is
71-1_437.76_2.145.wav_ASR	so i of course ignored it and went to sleep
71-1_440.66_2.93.wav_ASR	and the next day i couldn't work at all
71-1_443.78_1.7.wav_ASR	i was trying to write a conference proposal
71-1_445.86_0.64.wav_ASR	and nothing would work
71-1_446.77_1.3.wav_ASR	and i couldn't do puzzles
71-1_449.31_3.735.wav_ASR	so i went to get hair my hair cut the next day
71-1_453.11_3.247.wav_ASR	and i wanted to cancel because i had a really bad headache
71-1_456.67_2.13.wav_ASR	but if you canceled you hadta pay for it
71-1_459.29_1.889.wav_ASR	and my hair really needed to be cut
71-1_461.93_0.942.wav_ASR	so i went in
71-1_462.93_1.662.wav_ASR	i live alone
71-1_464.592_2.463.wav_ASR	so i hadn't really talked to anybody in two days
71-1_467.512_1.658.wav_ASR	and sat down in the chair
71-1_469.572_2.734.wav_ASR	and i couldn't tell her how i wanted to get my hair cut
71-1_473.192_2.18.wav_ASR	i couldn't say bobq
71-1_476.352_4.42.wav_ASR	so i couldn't tell her that i'd been wearing sweatpants
71-1_481.512_1.76.wav_ASR	i don't know what was coming
71-1_483.692_0.608.wav_ASR	i i was talking
71-1_484.66_2.06.wav_ASR	and she was nodding and smiling
71-1_486.78_1.691.wav_ASR	but she had no idea what i was talking about
71-1_489.8_0.46.wav_ASR	so i said
71-1_490.62_1.01.wav_ASR	well something's wrong
71-1_492.54_1.8.wav_ASR	so i told her
71-1_494.62_0.3.wav_ASR	i said
71-1_495.129_0.678.wav_ASR	i like your hair
71-1_497.02_2.56.wav_ASR	so she luckily she didn't have hideous hair
71-1_499.94_1.89.wav_ASR	but she cut my hair the way she was
71-1_502.08_0.3.wav_ASR	and i said
71-1_502.46_3.93.wav_ASR	you know i better go call a doctor because this doesn't make any sense
71-1_507.5_2.1.wav_ASR	so i i i
71-1_510.16_4.24.wav_ASR	and and i think this is something that must happen with people that have strokes is that they
71-1_516.46_3.62.wav_ASR	i looked up the number that i was supposta call urgent clinic
71-1_520.22_1.589.wav_ASR	and this was already six o'clock at night
71-1_522.35_2.64.wav_ASR	and it had all of these choices
71-1_526.21_3.46.wav_ASR	if it's an immediate emergency go call nine one one
71-1_530.13_0.33.wav_ASR	and i thought
71-1_530.61_0.757.wav_ASR	well that's not me
71-1_531.59_3.737.wav_ASR	i'm just gonna make an appointment and go into the urgent clinic tomorrow morning
71-1_536.11_0.706.wav_ASR	and then it said
71-1_537.11_3.2.wav_ASR	if it's this situation call two
71-1_540.703_4.014.wav_ASR	and if it's this situation call you know press three
71-1_545.023_2.16.wav_ASR	and if it's this situation call four
71-1_548.083_3.82.wav_ASR	and apparently if you stayed on for two and a half minutes they finally say
71-1_552.343_1.811.wav_ASR	a real person will come on the line
71-1_555.283_1.601.wav_ASR	but my head really hurt
71-1_557.243_0.593.wav_ASR	and i was just going
71-1_557.903_1.16.wav_ASR	well this isn't helping
71-1_559.46_2.24.wav_ASR	so i hung up the phone and said
71-1_561.9_1.13.wav_ASR	i'll just get up tomorrow morning
71-1_563.38_2.36.wav_ASR	and i'll see if i anybody will answer the phone
71-1_566.68_1.06.wav_ASR	but i called my daughter
71-1_568.34_4.12.wav_ASR	and she she was very frightened
71-1_573.0_0.6.wav_ASR	she just said
71-1_573.7_1.12.wav_ASR	you don't sound like yourself
71-1_576.13_1.22.wav_ASR	you need to go take an ambulance
71-1_577.9_1.29.wav_ASR	i'm not gonna pay for an ambulance
71-1_579.24_0.78.wav_ASR	that's ridiculous
71-1_580.52_1.22.wav_ASR	there's nothing wrong with me
71-1_581.84_0.82.wav_ASR	i just have a headache
71-1_582.9_2.28.wav_ASR	and i don't wanna spend that much money
71-1_586.02_6.16.wav_ASR	and she and her partner they called the fire department
71-1_592.48_0.8.wav_ASR	she's in minneapolis
71-1_593.56_2.263.wav_ASR	she's just finishing school up there
71-1_596.04_2.585.wav_ASR	but she they called the fire department in madison
71-1_598.625_1.419.wav_ASR	and they said
71-1_601.165_2.74.wav_ASR	hypothetically this is paula
71-1_604.725_1.16.wav_ASR	this is her situation
71-1_606.385_0.335.wav_ASR	and they said
71-1_607.54_1.23.wav_ASR	it sounds like she's having a stroke
71-1_609.285_2.315.wav_ASR	she needs to get to the emergency room
71-1_613.76_1.04.wav_ASR	and and they said
71-1_614.845_1.205.wav_ASR	but she doesn't wanna go
71-1_616.36_0.52.wav_ASR	and they said
71-1_616.96_5.542.wav_ASR	all of a sudden i know is i'm you know getting ready to eat supper
71-1_623.14_4.643.wav_ASR	and i hear these people running up the stairs outside my my apartment
71-1_628.28_4.927.wav_ASR	they had just sent over really goodlooking firemen by the way
71-1_633.62_2.12.wav_ASR	i think it must be the uniform
71-1_636.04_0.645.wav_ASR	i'm not sure
71-1_637.365_1.928.wav_ASR	i answered the door
71-1_639.285_1.265.wav_ASR	and i told them that
71-1_640.825_1.38.wav_ASR	no i didn't have
71-1_642.545_1.252.wav_ASR	i didn't know what was going on
71-1_644.165_1.173.wav_ASR	but i couldn't talk
71-1_646.805_1.205.wav_ASR	you needta come with us right now
71-1_648.285_0.355.wav_ASR	and i said
71-1_648.745_0.913.wav_ASR	well no i'll take a
71-1_650.705_0.335.wav_ASR	and they said
71-1_651.417_0.908.wav_ASR	you can't drive
71-1_653.105_1.585.wav_ASR	well i'm gonna go tomorrow to the doctor
71-1_654.885_1.437.wav_ASR	no you're gonna go with us right now
71-1_656.32_0.62.wav_ASR	and i said
71-1_657.32_0.817.wav_ASR	well alright
71-1_658.28_2.28.wav_ASR	well let me get my coat and all the other stuff
71-1_660.88_3.715.wav_ASR	and all of a sudden i got into the emergency room
71-1_664.74_1.961.wav_ASR	and it was just this huge
71-1_667.8_1.86.wav_ASR	everyone's racing around and yelling
71-1_670.22_6.1.wav_ASR	and all of a sudden they hauled me in for a a cat scan and came out and said
71-1_676.5_1.02.wav_ASR	yeah you had a stroke
71-1_678.32_2.727.wav_ASR	so i asked the doctor if my god i could see it
71-1_681.06_3.681.wav_ASR	and he showed me on the cat scan exactly what had happened
71-1_685.44_3.23.wav_ASR	and they admitted me
71-1_689.38_2.962.wav_ASR	so that's how i found out i had a stroke
71-1_692.75_6.56.wav_ASR	i i i really have had no issues whatsoever with muscle feet weakness
71-1_699.81_1.65.wav_ASR	if i had i might've known sooner
71-1_702.78_2.04.wav_ASR	i just didn't know about the headache
71-1_705.03_0.95.wav_ASR	i've never had one again
71-1_706.88_1.18.wav_ASR	i've never had one before
71-1_708.53_7.93.wav_ASR	but apparently if you get a really really bad headache that hits you on the side of the head it means you should probably go to the emergency room
71-1_717.45_2.54.wav_ASR	so i don't know if that gave you
71-1_720.582_1.363.wav_ASR	it it doesn't give you a lot of insight
71-1_722.34_8.435.wav_ASR	again if i'd gone there immediately right after i had worked out when i had the headache it's possible that they could have stopped it
71-1_731.3_3.77.wav_ASR	but at that point the window of opportunity had closed
71-1_737.18_5.617.wav_ASR	but it was an ischemic stroke not a hemorrhagic stroke
71-1_743.84_6.846.wav_ASR	and it they ultimately decided it was cryptogenic because they've not been able to find out why i had it
71-1_751.22_7.24.wav_ASR	i all of my medical numbers are good
71-1_758.94_0.8.wav_ASR	i'm not diabetic
71-1_760.32_0.82.wav_ASR	i don't smoke
71-1_762.02_1.88.wav_ASR	i have low blood pressure
71-1_764.42_2.25.wav_ASR	everything looks good
71-1_767.76_1.39.wav_ASR	but i did indeed have a stroke
71-1_769.54_2.64.wav_ASR	so something happened somewhere
71-1_772.78_3.16.wav_ASR	and in the hospital i got to watch the insurrection
71-1_776.46_0.954.wav_ASR	and it was just
71-1_780.18_0.96.wav_ASR	yeah right
71-1_781.58_4.48.wav_ASR	yeah so two years later here i am
71-1_797.2_17.56.wav_ASR	and if i ever get to the point that i'm articulate enough about this i'm going to use my political science advocacy and and research and do something more about getting people some kind of treatment
71-1_814.772_2.553.wav_ASR	i was given almost nothing
71-1_817.552_3.086.wav_ASR	partially i think it was because
71-1_820.772_2.485.wav_ASR	and and really madison wisconsin is a major city
71-1_823.472_6.42.wav_ASR	so i shoulda been able to get the best type of help available
71-1_830.372_0.477.wav_ASR	but i didn't
71-1_830.849_4.78.wav_ASR	the best i could get was we found two speech therapists
71-1_836.569_2.232.wav_ASR	one of them only specialized in children
71-1_839.189_1.351.wav_ASR	so i didn't work with her
71-1_840.909_0.92.wav_ASR	the other person
71-1_842.229_4.18.wav_ASR	and it was literally one hour a week for eleven weeks
71-1_847.59_16.523.wav_ASR	and basically because i am an academic because i have the ability to read complicated texts and because that part of my brain wasn't hurt interfered with in any way i hadta do my own research
71-1_864.29_2.08.wav_ASR	i hadta do a lot of research about aphasia
71-1_866.55_4.28.wav_ASR	and the the speech therapist
71-1_871.09_0.612.wav_ASR	they're very different
71-1_872.39_3.118.wav_ASR	she i mean she helped me a lot i would say
71-1_875.61_2.902.wav_ASR	so i should be looking up on this particular thing
71-1_878.63_2.25.wav_ASR	and i should be looking up on this particular topic
71-1_881.53_3.02.wav_ASR	and but she hadn't kept up with it either
71-1_884.71_4.16.wav_ASR	she hadn't learned about some of the most recent treatments that were available
71-1_889.53_7.52.wav_ASR	so basically what i did is i'm i went back to exercise as soon as they allowed me
71-1_897.35_2.7.wav_ASR	i couldn't work out for three months
71-1_900.34_5.67.wav_ASR	i could only walk because they were concerned that my physical activity had something to do with the stroke
71-1_906.42_0.66.wav_ASR	which is certainly
71-1_909.64_1.189.wav_ASR	so i just hadta walk
71-1_911.14_1.081.wav_ASR	i had to
71-1_913.2_1.401.wav_ASR	they tested me for afib
71-1_914.74_3.28.wav_ASR	and i hadta wear this monitor on for about three months
71-1_918.17_2.86.wav_ASR	but i don't have afib either so
71-1_921.33_2.315.wav_ASR	but i focus on diet
71-1_924.37_4.82.wav_ASR	i really wasn't drinking much alcohol at all then anyway
71-1_930.27_1.38.wav_ASR	but i've stopped it completely
71-1_932.87_2.66.wav_ASR	so now i'm back exercising as much as i can
71-1_935.83_2.18.wav_ASR	i'm really careful in terms of my diet
71-1_938.49_7.52.wav_ASR	and i'm really focused on inflammation limiting it in terms of my diet and what i eat
71-1_947.57_2.29.wav_ASR	and i write every day
71-1_950.51_1.38.wav_ASR	i journal every day
71-1_951.89_3.934.wav_ASR	right now i'm trying to write an article which i hope to get published
71-1_955.824_20.3.wav_ASR	because that's maybe the hardest thing for my brain that i've ever hadta do before the stroke or after is the ability to weave arguments together in a really really dense well written type of of argument
71-1_976.405_1.819.wav_ASR	so i have time to write
71-1_978.345_9.56.wav_ASR	i read aloud every day the newspapers because i think saying words is a way of reinstating those
71-1_988.605_2.865.wav_ASR	whether it's the files that were there
71-1_991.665_2.454.wav_ASR	or i just need to learn relearn how to say a word
71-1_994.405_0.82.wav_ASR	like abroadq
71-1_995.479_4.388.wav_ASR	i'll probably be able to say that a lot for a long time until a couple of weeks
71-1_999.919_4.279.wav_ASR	and then i'll mispronounce that one again
71-1_1005.119_5.531.wav_ASR	but that's really all i know how to do is keeping it up in terms of
71-1_1011.439_0.611.wav_ASR	oh and sleeping
71-1_1012.379_2.191.wav_ASR	i've always loved sleeping
71-1_1014.87_2.86.wav_ASR	i generally have gone without it enough
71-1_1018.68_1.81.wav_ASR	you know if you stay up late and you're doing something
71-1_1020.89_3.12.wav_ASR	but you still have to get up because you have a class or you've got stuff to do
71-1_1024.67_8.638.wav_ASR	i try to make sure i always have at least eight or nine hours a day to be able to sleep
71-1_1033.308_3.68.wav_ASR	and that seems to be something that i didn't needta do before
71-1_1037.181_1.688.wav_ASR	but now i really do needta do
71-1_1038.968_2.762.wav_ASR	mhm but that's all i'm doing
71-1_1042.028_0.872.wav_ASR	i'm still working
71-1_1043.248_1.404.wav_ASR	but i'm not able to teach
71-1_1045.089_3.024.wav_ASR	you can see what i would be like in ninety minutes
71-1_1048.268_0.89.wav_ASR	i'd get in front of a class
71-1_1049.328_0.769.wav_ASR	and i'd start talking
71-1_1050.288_0.602.wav_ASR	and people would be going
71-1_1051.388_0.52.wav_ASR	what what
71-1_1052.271_0.5.wav_ASR	no
71-1_1054.451_1.998.wav_ASR	so maybe that'll come back
71-1_1056.791_0.58.wav_ASR	or i can do
71-1_1058.051_3.74.wav_ASR	i could teach through online through and stuff
71-1_1062.471_2.149.wav_ASR	but so far i'm just doing other stuff
71-1_1064.971_1.119.wav_ASR	but i did love teaching
71-1_1067.49_1.36.wav_ASR	we'll see if i can get back to it again
71-1_1069.371_0.419.wav_ASR	i don't know
71-1_1070.87_1.35.wav_ASR	anyway so that's what i do
71-1_1072.81_4.64.wav_ASR	and and i think doing it consistently is really really important
71-1_1077.79_2.66.wav_ASR	and i just keep pushing myself to do different things
71-1_1081.13_6.08.wav_ASR	there's literally nothing that i'm not forcing myself to
71-1_1087.51_0.909.wav_ASR	not forcing myself
71-1_1088.69_2.265.wav_ASR	but certain things i go through every single day
71-1_1091.81_2.36.wav_ASR	i do yoga every night
71-1_1094.51_1.1.wav_ASR	i think that's useful
71-1_1096.57_1.69.wav_ASR	i don't know
71-1_1098.26_19.94.wav_ASR	again i'm always looking at research always trying to find something that's going to increase my healing in some way or another to the extent that my brain will be able to repair those language pathways since that's that was is what was disrupted
71-1_1119.04_7.42.wav_ASR	i spent a fair amount of time trying to figure out why a righthanded person with a stroke on the right side ended up with aphasia
71-1_1127.38_10.66.wav_ASR	but i mean other than the fact that it doesn't qualify me for many clinical trials because they do require the left hand stroke aphasia
71-1_1138.248_3.801.wav_ASR	other than that i guess i just don't worry about it all that much
71-1_1142.228_13.0.wav_ASR	i'm just doing what i can to try to heal and relying on neuroplasticity to be able to take take hold
71-1_1155.48_9.755.wav_ASR	though i do understand that at my age in my sixties plasticity is less likely as much as healing is
71-1_1165.72_1.66.wav_ASR	so i don't know
71-1_1167.66_0.67.wav_ASR	we'll see what
71-1_1168.91_6.48.wav_ASR	i just watch it every day this work in progress it seems like
71-1_1175.93_2.077.wav_ASR	how it comes out and how it doesn't come out
71-1_1178.67_1.08.wav_ASR	we'll see yeah
71-1_1179.91_1.98.wav_ASR	a lot of people don't know i have aphasia
71-1_1182.17_12.68.wav_ASR	and i like keeping it that way because the there is a a stigma attached attached to having a disability even if it's an invisible disability
71-1_1196.42_8.392.wav_ASR	i'd rather have people just think i misspoke than having them think that they have to speak very carefully around me
71-1_1205.08_4.784.wav_ASR	so i i'd rather just see if i can just wing it
71-1_1210.7_3.66.wav_ASR	so yeah very few people know that i have aphasia
71-1_1214.592_1.416.wav_ASR	mostly family members know
71-1_1216.008_3.437.wav_ASR	but i don't tell anyone else about it
71-1_1219.768_1.825.wav_ASR	i just try to figure it out
71-1_1242.33_1.36.wav_ASR	and it should be something important
71-1_1246.83_4.6.wav_ASR	well you know i i guess i would
71-1_1251.764_12.94.wav_ASR	something that i would say is being very important for me was working with a menominee elder who
71-1_1266.024_2.112.wav_ASR	i'm very close to her
71-1_1268.136_3.957.wav_ASR	i met ada deer about ten years ago
71-1_1273.036_2.404.wav_ASR	probably more fifteen years at this point
71-1_1276.336_2.78.wav_ASR	and i was teaching at a university
71-1_1279.476_1.38.wav_ASR	and i invited her to
71-1_1280.996_6.4.wav_ASR	i was the advisor of the native students organization because my research is on state tribal relationships
71-1_1287.93_7.06.wav_ASR	and i had invited her to come and speak in one of my classes
71-1_1295.79_0.926.wav_ASR	and she came down
71-1_1297.17_2.48.wav_ASR	and we hit it off with each other
71-1_1300.24_3.96.wav_ASR	and she was one of the most remarkable people that i've ever met
71-1_1304.73_5.19.wav_ASR	she was the oldest in a family of eleven
71-1_1310.55_3.42.wav_ASR	she grew up on the menominee reservation without running water
71-1_1315.01_5.11.wav_ASR	she was the first person to get a college degree from her tribe
71-1_1321.04_3.68.wav_ASR	and she became the first female tribal chair
71-1_1325.92_7.08.wav_ASR	and in the last ten years i would say we've gone on trips together
71-1_1333.92_3.12.wav_ASR	and generally because as she's getting older she's in her eighties
71-1_1337.32_0.87.wav_ASR	so she lets me drive
71-1_1339.05_7.74.wav_ASR	and we go to different events or different hearings in which she's going to offer testimony
71-1_1347.67_7.05.wav_ASR	and what i've learned from hanging out with this woman who's indomitable is the word i would use
71-1_1355.21_1.06.wav_ASR	she's around five
71-1_1356.984_2.503.wav_ASR	she doesn't see that well anymore
71-1_1359.704_1.4.wav_ASR	she has trouble reading anymore
71-1_1361.57_3.02.wav_ASR	but she has me write speeches for her
71-1_1365.124_1.586.wav_ASR	she gets up and presents them
71-1_1366.71_12.02.wav_ASR	and she refuses to to listen to the the response no
71-1_1379.45_3.74.wav_ASR	which she will find a way to power on through
71-1_1384.07_3.535.wav_ASR	and she gets things done that other people have not done
71-1_1387.89_9.96.wav_ASR	and why i see this as important is my own mother is very passive and very kind of meek and believes that you defer to men
71-1_1398.43_12.315.wav_ASR	and hanging out with ada i have learned a great deal about what it means to be a powerful woman not to worry about if people are pissed off when you say something
71-1_1411.09_1.635.wav_ASR	and just get up
71-1_1412.95_0.663.wav_ASR	and say your truth
71-1_1414.29_1.84.wav_ASR	and present your testimony
71-1_1416.263_8.47.wav_ASR	and push every lever that you can legally to be able to get things through that you wanna get through
71-1_1424.733_14.14.wav_ASR	so working with ada over the last couple of years we've been able to stop a mine from taking place which would've been sited on the banks of the menominee river which would've been really disastrous
71-1_1440.7_6.776.wav_ASR	so she has been my inspiration in terms of what i've learned from her
71-1_1447.78_1.68.wav_ASR	she's also really funny
71-1_1449.92_2.26.wav_ASR	so there's that's the other thing
71-1_1452.86_0.96.wav_ASR	so yeah
71-1_1454.02_6.652.wav_ASR	she's been an ongoing source of importance for me i think to model myself after
71-1_1514.123_7.78.wav_ASR	well i mean it looks like begins with a boy who's playing with a soccer ball
71-1_1522.3_7.984.wav_ASR	and he's practicing on his own probably in his yard because this is something that he's really interested in doing
71-1_1530.81_8.77.wav_ASR	and he kicked the ball maybe a little bit too powerfully than he wanted
71-1_1540.7_3.8.wav_ASR	and it broke into the window next door
71-1_1545.58_2.64.wav_ASR	and unfortunately he broke the window
71-1_1549.0_11.31.wav_ASR	and the ball came through the window right next to the chair where his next door neighbor a man is sitting on his chair
71-1_1561.7_4.32.wav_ASR	so he's obviously really upset about this because he could have been hurt
71-1_1566.34_1.16.wav_ASR	and the glass is broken
71-1_1568.22_1.04.wav_ASR	and it's in his yard
71-1_1569.74_1.088.wav_ASR	and it shouldn't have happened
71-1_1571.64_7.02.wav_ASR	and so he grabs the chair looks out the window to find the culprit who did this to him
71-1_1578.75_3.64.wav_ASR	how is there going to be some kind of
71-1_1582.51_3.18.wav_ASR	he's gonna need some kind of reparations that are made an apology
71-1_1585.938_20.64.wav_ASR	he looks like he's about ready to head over grab the boy and head over to the boy's parents to try to figure out how the window would be paid for how he would get his apology and the promise that the neighbor boy would never do the same thing again would stay away from the windows
71-1_1623.92_0.5.wav_ASR	okay
71-1_1624.855_4.46.wav_ASR	well it looks as if this little
71-1_1630.595_1.88.wav_ASR	i'd say
71-1_1632.686_1.727.wav_ASR	actually it could be kind of
71-1_1635.675_3.5.wav_ASR	i can't decide if it's male or female
71-1_1639.515_3.031.wav_ASR	we'll say theyq because perfect we're safe with theyq
71-1_1643.288_9.44.wav_ASR	they is getting ready to head out to the library somewhere some trip somewhere
71-1_1653.76_5.85.wav_ASR	and their mother looked outside and said
71-1_1660.248_1.642.wav_ASR	you know i think we're gonna see some rain
71-1_1662.48_1.17.wav_ASR	you might need the umbrella
71-1_1664.82_1.11.wav_ASR	but this child said
71-1_1666.34_1.55.wav_ASR	i don't need an umbrella
71-1_1668.44_1.2.wav_ASR	i mean this is ridiculous
71-1_1669.94_0.6.wav_ASR	it's not gonna rain
71-1_1670.78_1.68.wav_ASR	and i don't really care about getting wet
71-1_1672.82_0.87.wav_ASR	you know i don't melt
71-1_1674.76_0.73.wav_ASR	i'm not like sugar
71-1_1675.74_1.68.wav_ASR	i don't melt when the water hits me
71-1_1678.28_1.97.wav_ASR	so this this child said
71-1_1680.78_0.88.wav_ASR	i'm leaving anyway
71-1_1681.66_1.72.wav_ASR	this child went outside
71-1_1683.529_1.775.wav_ASR	immediately began to rain
71-1_1686.38_1.31.wav_ASR	and all of a sudden said
71-1_1688.02_4.78.wav_ASR	wait i'm getting raindrops in my eyes
71-1_1693.33_1.4.wav_ASR	i'm getting really wet
71-1_1695.36_1.22.wav_ASR	this is not pleasant
71-1_1697.22_2.14.wav_ASR	i didn't understand that it would be getting in my eyes
71-1_1700.24_4.96.wav_ASR	so i immediately headed back because it was raining much harder than i thought it was
71-1_1706.08_0.654.wav_ASR	i walked in
71-1_1706.84_0.896.wav_ASR	said to my mother
71-1_1708.14_1.485.wav_ASR	i just looked at her
71-1_1710.54_2.22.wav_ASR	she of course knew that i was right
71-1_1713.18_11.1.wav_ASR	the mother immediately understood that while it was very difficult for this child to ask for it or to acknowledge that they were wrong
71-1_1725.08_5.08.wav_ASR	they did make clear that they did indeed need an umbrella if they were gonna be walking to the library
71-1_1730.64_3.56.wav_ASR	so the mother then gave them the umbrella
71-1_1734.68_10.14.wav_ASR	and they went back on their way with an umbrella remembering at this point that maybe mothers actually know what they're talking about when they said that
71-1_1761.65_0.5.wav_ASR	okay
71-1_1762.547_29.94.wav_ASR	well what happened is that the cat that belongs to the little girl ran up in a tree and began to meow making very clear that it did want to get off the tree but no longer knew how to get back from the end of the branch that it had ended up on and was just meowing you know sadly saying
71-1_1800.778_0.579.wav_ASR	help me
71-1_1802.158_0.382.wav_ASR	help me
71-1_1802.54_6.1.wav_ASR	and the little girl is obviously just really empathizing about the situation of her cat
71-1_1808.838_1.772.wav_ASR	and she's very worried about getting her cat out
71-1_1811.358_5.082.wav_ASR	so she began by going to her father and said
71-1_1816.78_4.1.wav_ASR	can you please help me get the cat out of the tree
71-1_1820.94_4.437.wav_ASR	and the father said
71-1_1825.6_0.417.wav_ASR	of course
71-1_1826.1_18.22.wav_ASR	and he grabbed his ladder and put it against the tree and climbed up but could not get back up to the the the limb where the cat was because those branches are too fragile
71-1_1845.67_8.6.wav_ASR	he also inadvertently kicked off the ladder which then puts him back in a situation that he needs to be rescued
71-1_1855.03_5.868.wav_ASR	so at this point the dog is now barking because the dog wants the father to get out of the tree
71-1_1861.6_10.368.wav_ASR	the barking the dog of the dog is making it more difficult for the cat to be able to inch its way back down to the trunk
71-1_1872.9_8.052.wav_ASR	the little girl is still really really stressing because cat cat her cat is up in
71-1_1880.952_2.68.wav_ASR	that's a semantic paraphasic error
71-1_1883.772_0.899.wav_ASR	i make that all the time
71-1_1885.192_3.057.wav_ASR	is really wants her cat to be able to get out
71-1_1888.249_17.88.wav_ASR	so they call the fire department to come down and not just rescue the cat but also rescue the father since he now needs also to be rescued since his attempt at putting the ladder against the tree wasn't helpful
71-1_1906.179_13.419.wav_ASR	but it it does absolutely shows that the father was really trying to do whatever his daughter wanted him to do in terms of helping get the cat out of the tree
71-1_1939.75_0.39.wav_ASR	i have
71-1_2104.158_2.744.wav_ASR	i'll keep the feminist critique out of it
71-1_2107.478_3.16.wav_ASR	that'll be next time around
71-1_2113.118_0.492.wav_ASR	alright
71-1_2113.85_8.89.wav_ASR	cinderella is she's the daughter of a widow
71-1_2123.66_2.76.wav_ASR	her mother has has been killed
71-1_2127.23_2.66.wav_ASR	and so the two of them are living
71-1_2131.04_13.9.wav_ASR	and the her father decides that it would be really helpful for his daughter if he remarried if he could provide a mother for his daughter cinderella
71-1_2146.02_1.74.wav_ASR	so he met this woman
71-1_2149.12_2.03.wav_ASR	i don't know that we've ever heard her name
71-1_2151.74_3.0.wav_ASR	but anyways otherwise known as stepmother
71-1_2155.58_6.48.wav_ASR	made very clear that she would be a wonderful mother to cinderella
71-1_2162.44_1.851.wav_ASR	she also had two daughters of her own
71-1_2165.48_1.34.wav_ASR	so they marry
71-1_2167.42_10.34.wav_ASR	and unfortunately the way that cinderella was treated was not appropriate
71-1_2178.36_5.417.wav_ASR	she was not treated the same way that the stepmother's daughters were treated
71-1_2183.777_4.48.wav_ASR	and instead she was used as a maid
71-1_2188.336_5.469.wav_ASR	and and i have no idea where her father is in this whole picture and why he's not doing anything about this
71-1_2194.037_3.593.wav_ASR	but maybe he's traveling or he's gone or whatever
71-1_2197.83_17.72.wav_ASR	but he's left the management of his daughter to this stepmother who treats her very badly doesn't treat her the same and has given the message to her daughters that it is fine to treat cinderella badly
71-1_2216.67_10.5.wav_ASR	so she effectively becomes the maid to these two stepsisters and to a stepmother
71-1_2228.39_5.92.wav_ASR	but she she's a a very very sweet young woman
71-1_2235.23_16.92.wav_ASR	she's found a way to also have happiness and establish relationships with the animals because that's one of her jobs as a maid is to make sure that the animals are fed
71-1_2252.39_1.84.wav_ASR	so she sings to them
71-1_2255.14_0.93.wav_ASR	they love her
71-1_2256.32_5.39.wav_ASR	she's close to the the the horses the other animals
71-1_2262.1_9.26.wav_ASR	and she dreams about being in a better situation where she's loved and is treated with more respect than she is
71-1_2271.67_11.59.wav_ASR	she's also quite beautiful which is certainly one of the reasons why the stepsisters are so mean to her because they are not anywhere near as attractive as she is
71-1_2284.39_18.53.wav_ASR	but while this is going on in this household the king of the jurisdiction has made it clear to his son that it's time for him to marry because the king would like to retire
71-1_2303.08_7.52.wav_ASR	and he'd like to hand down the kingdom to his son
71-1_2311.32_1.88.wav_ASR	but first his son has to marry
71-1_2313.84_2.509.wav_ASR	and he doesn't really want to
71-1_2316.62_1.587.wav_ASR	he's not interested in anyone
71-1_2318.34_1.38.wav_ASR	he's not dating anyone
71-1_2320.22_3.01.wav_ASR	but the plan is that this is his duty
71-1_2324.16_3.094.wav_ASR	and so he is kind of like the prince harry of that time
71-1_2327.3_3.0.wav_ASR	the spare and not william
71-1_2331.06_5.74.wav_ASR	but in any case the plan is that there's gonna be a a giant ball a dance
71-1_2336.832_13.545.wav_ASR	and all of the eligible which i guess means of childbearing bearing bearing years are supposta show up at this dance so that he can pick the one that he wants
71-1_2350.732_4.303.wav_ASR	and again we will not get into the feminist critique of how this all works
71-1_2356.58_2.034.wav_ASR	but essentially the word gets out
71-1_2359.36_6.948.wav_ASR	and the two stepsisters are just really excited about this idea because they're the right age
71-1_2366.94_9.235.wav_ASR	because their mother had married cinderella's father who makes a fair amount of money they can dress really well
71-1_2376.175_11.163.wav_ASR	they can really get dressed up to go to this dance and see if they could be the one that would attract the the attention of the prince
71-1_2388.615_1.676.wav_ASR	cinderella wants to go
71-1_2390.815_3.322.wav_ASR	she also reads about this that that it's coming
71-1_2394.137_3.18.wav_ASR	and that she knows she's eligible because she's the right age
71-1_2397.537_6.18.wav_ASR	and i guess she's of that nationality or whatever criteria they're using
71-1_2404.5_6.33.wav_ASR	but her stepmother kind of makes clear that no she she's not invited to go
71-1_2411.78_5.16.wav_ASR	she's not gonna be able to go to stores and buy clothes the way that her daughters will
71-1_2417.82_2.25.wav_ASR	so she tries to make something on her own
71-1_2420.4_3.38.wav_ASR	she tries to take the materials and the rags that are available to her
71-1_2424.24_4.62.wav_ASR	she looks up how to make them in a book
71-1_2429.36_1.08.wav_ASR	that was on page eleven
71-1_2430.56_1.38.wav_ASR	i think that's what was going on there
71-1_2432.61_1.33.wav_ASR	and she comes up with a dress
71-1_2434.24_1.5.wav_ASR	and of course she looks amazing in it
71-1_2436.71_9.244.wav_ASR	if this were pretty in pink the film with molly ringwald she'd have gotten away with it
71-1_2446.2_1.78.wav_ASR	but this is not pretty in pink
71-1_2449.65_1.12.wav_ASR	this is cinderella
71-1_2450.992_2.458.wav_ASR	so her mother laughs at her and says
71-1_2453.57_1.49.wav_ASR	you're not going out with those clothes
71-1_2455.45_2.61.wav_ASR	and her stepsisters mock her
71-1_2458.95_2.32.wav_ASR	and she's out in the barn by herself
71-1_2462.19_9.66.wav_ASR	and all of a sudden this fairy godmother shows up based on one of her wishes
71-1_2472.03_2.42.wav_ASR	i wish i could go to the ball
71-1_2475.65_12.128.wav_ASR	and she the reason that the fairy fairy godmother is showing up is because she knows that cinderella is a really sweet young girl
71-1_2488.53_2.041.wav_ASR	and she cares about everybody else
71-1_2490.87_1.674.wav_ASR	and she does things for everybody else
71-1_2492.544_4.96.wav_ASR	and because of the purity of her heart she deserves this chance
71-1_2498.584_2.36.wav_ASR	so she uses her magical powers
71-1_2502.18_6.324.wav_ASR	and she not only creates a dress for her that is incredibly ornate
71-1_2509.124_2.72.wav_ASR	she can go to the oscars with something like that
71-1_2511.9_14.753.wav_ASR	but she also transforms the mice into horses and the pumpkin into a carriage to be able to take her so that she can get there
71-1_2526.84_2.1.wav_ASR	and she can arrive in style
71-1_2529.78_4.64.wav_ASR	so cinderella is very very happy hugs her
71-1_2534.78_0.88.wav_ASR	and her godmother said
71-1_2535.86_5.98.wav_ASR	but remember this dream will only last until midnight
71-1_2542.26_4.463.wav_ASR	at midnight your dress will go back to your rags
71-1_2546.723_5.94.wav_ASR	your horses will be transformed back into mice
71-1_2554.163_6.318.wav_ASR	and the carriage will be transformed back into a pumpkin
71-1_2561.13_0.573.wav_ASR	and she says
71-1_2561.943_0.442.wav_ASR	yes i know
71-1_2562.423_0.792.wav_ASR	thank you very much
71-1_2563.463_3.157.wav_ASR	so she heads to the the ball
71-1_2567.38_17.24.wav_ASR	and of course because she is so elegantly attired and shows up with this really regal type of carriage she's treated as royalty herself
71-1_2584.975_2.916.wav_ASR	she the footman opens the door
71-1_2588.095_0.812.wav_ASR	they help her out
71-1_2589.635_0.812.wav_ASR	she walks in there
71-1_2590.635_2.32.wav_ASR	and immediately the prince just like
71-1_2593.435_0.658.wav_ASR	it's like that
71-1_2594.515_2.3.wav_ASR	it's like he's been struck by lightning
71-1_2597.575_1.165.wav_ASR	she's the one i want to be with
71-1_2598.975_1.165.wav_ASR	and he heads over to her
71-1_2600.475_2.06.wav_ASR	and there's an instant attraction
71-1_2604.46_2.0.wav_ASR	he dances with her the entire night
71-1_2606.82_5.16.wav_ASR	he's pretty clear that maybe at this point marriage isn't the worst thing in the world if i get to be with this woman
71-1_2613.19_4.0.wav_ASR	and and all of a sudden at this point she's pulling away
71-1_2617.56_0.34.wav_ASR	and she's saying
71-1_2618.12_0.46.wav_ASR	no i gotta go
71-1_2618.76_0.34.wav_ASR	and he's going
71-1_2619.22_1.32.wav_ASR	no no stick around
71-1_2620.94_0.6.wav_ASR	we've got food
71-1_2622.58_0.6.wav_ASR	you can stay here all night
71-1_2624.18_1.12.wav_ASR	and she said
71-1_2625.6_0.71.wav_ASR	no i've gotta get back
71-1_2626.5_0.52.wav_ASR	i've gotta go
71-1_2627.3_5.8.wav_ASR	and she runs away at about two or three minutes to midnight because her she says
71-1_2633.26_1.166.wav_ASR	i've got this curfew
71-1_2634.56_0.786.wav_ASR	and i've gotta get away
71-1_2635.38_1.167.wav_ASR	and she races away
71-1_2637.7_2.81.wav_ASR	and she's a really fast runner
71-1_2640.94_0.44.wav_ASR	so she's away
71-1_2641.38_4.57.wav_ASR	but all of a sudden he sees that one of her shoes has been left there
71-1_2646.16_0.98.wav_ASR	a glass slipper
71-1_2647.86_2.174.wav_ASR	and so he picks that up
71-1_2650.2_3.24.wav_ASR	that's all he is got of her is this glass slipper
71-1_2654.1_2.56.wav_ASR	so he goes back to his father and said
71-1_2657.28_1.28.wav_ASR	okay i'll marry somebody
71-1_2658.86_1.868.wav_ASR	but there's only one woman i wanna marry
71-1_2660.728_1.516.wav_ASR	and she's the one i wanna marry
71-1_2662.968_4.68.wav_ASR	and all i have is this clue that her foot will fit into this slipper
71-1_2668.928_2.54.wav_ASR	so they start advertising around the kingdom
71-1_2672.608_7.36.wav_ASR	anyone whose feet will fit into these slippers the prince will sees you as a contender
71-1_2680.85_7.16.wav_ASR	so my god all the step stepsisters who you know they were ignored at the ball
71-1_2688.27_2.82.wav_ASR	but they are pretty sure they can get their feet into this slipper
71-1_2692.05_1.6.wav_ASR	they may be one of the contenders
71-1_2694.54_19.21.wav_ASR	and and of course at this point cinderella's back doing her work taking care of the animals cleaning in the kitchen once again just discarded and ignored and mocked and treated disrespectfully by her family
71-1_2714.59_1.81.wav_ASR	so the prince starts driving around
71-1_2716.91_4.25.wav_ASR	and i mean it's this really bizarre sort sort of thing that he's driving around
71-1_2721.43_10.724.wav_ASR	and people are running out taking off their shoes and seeing if their feet will fit into this slipper which is apparently designed specifically to fit this one single woman
71-1_2733.67_1.9.wav_ASR	and he stops at their house
71-1_2735.77_6.34.wav_ASR	and he is really discouraged at this point because he hasn't yet found the woman whose feet will fit into that slipper
71-1_2743.01_1.095.wav_ASR	he stops at this house
71-1_2744.37_2.793.wav_ASR	both of the stepsisters do everything they can
71-1_2747.29_3.08.wav_ASR	but their feet are just too big or too long or
71-1_2750.71_0.798.wav_ASR	it's not working
71-1_2751.632_3.22.wav_ASR	and then all of a sudden
71-1_2755.261_2.278.wav_ASR	he's just about ready to leave
71-1_2757.592_1.74.wav_ASR	and all of a sudden he sees a movement
71-1_2760.172_5.59.wav_ASR	and he sees this other woman the maid who's just in the corner
71-1_2766.572_0.428.wav_ASR	and he said
71-1_2767.252_0.588.wav_ASR	what about her
71-1_2768.83_1.36.wav_ASR	and the stepmother said
71-1_2770.312_0.798.wav_ASR	no she's nobody
71-1_2771.5_0.97.wav_ASR	she's our maid
71-1_2773.43_1.84.wav_ASR	and she looks up
71-1_2775.92_5.43.wav_ASR	and he the prince just has this strange feeling about her and said
71-1_2781.92_1.44.wav_ASR	i'd like to have her come out
71-1_2783.78_7.311.wav_ASR	and i'd like to see if if the slippers will fit her feet
71-1_2791.091_2.035.wav_ASR	and so she comes out
71-1_2793.371_0.92.wav_ASR	and she's a mess
71-1_2794.711_3.639.wav_ASR	you know she's been working in the kitchen and in the barn
71-1_2798.931_6.2.wav_ASR	and she's you know not not looking anywhere like the princess person that had been at the ball
71-1_2805.87_0.8.wav_ASR	but she came out
71-1_2806.831_0.759.wav_ASR	she sat down
71-1_2808.51_3.56.wav_ASR	the prince put the slipper on her foot
71-1_2812.99_1.08.wav_ASR	and it fit
71-1_2814.73_0.98.wav_ASR	and then he looked at her
71-1_2815.71_22.48.wav_ASR	and what was remarkable is that he was able to look beyond all of the pageantry of the royalty of the wealth that she had shown the first time he'd met her to see that it was exactly the same person even if she was clearly not of the same status he that he had assumed initially
71-1_2839.43_15.337.wav_ASR	so they lived happily after until just like prince harry somehow the paparazzi did not like this cinderella because she was not of high enough status
71-1_2854.767_18.19.wav_ASR	and he hadta renounce his crown and go to another continent and then start writing producing netflix netflix netflix films about his situation to make money
71-1_2872.957_0.84.wav_ASR	alright alright
71-1_2874.864_1.272.wav_ASR	the end yeah
71-1_2900.37_0.5.wav_ASR	okay
71-1_2905.61_1.0.wav_ASR	clock clock
71-1_2910.67_11.58.wav_ASR	an interesting really irritating thing about clocks to me recently is that i went to a physical checkup
71-1_2923.03_2.831.wav_ASR	and i had just turned sixty five
71-1_2926.39_2.52.wav_ASR	and so i had never experienced this before
71-1_2929.05_5.28.wav_ASR	i thought it was annual my annual physical checkup
71-1_2935.52_1.03.wav_ASR	i walked in the room
71-1_2936.75_0.57.wav_ASR	and i sat down
71-1_2937.65_2.34.wav_ASR	and the nurse is checking my blood pressure
71-1_2940.41_4.62.wav_ASR	and she's checking you know the my heart rate my pulse and all the other stuff
71-1_2945.73_3.06.wav_ASR	and then she handed me a piece of paper and a pen and said
71-1_2948.98_1.34.wav_ASR	i'd like you to draw a clock
71-1_2951.06_1.01.wav_ASR	and i said
71-1_2953.58_0.57.wav_ASR	and she said
71-1_2954.34_3.38.wav_ASR	because i i want to see what kind of picture you you can draw
71-1_2958.32_2.76.wav_ASR	so it seemed ridiculous
71-1_2961.62_1.027.wav_ASR	but i did it anyway
71-1_2963.0_0.93.wav_ASR	i drew the circle
71-1_2964.52_9.32.wav_ASR	and i knew how to draw a picture appropriately with a clock which is first you put down the twelve
71-1_2974.0_0.89.wav_ASR	and then you put down the six
71-1_2975.14_0.66.wav_ASR	then you put the three
71-1_2975.98_0.71.wav_ASR	and then you put the nine
71-1_2976.74_8.82.wav_ASR	and then you fill in the numbers so that everything is located where it should be instead of you know having them too crowded
71-1_2986.12_3.09.wav_ASR	and then i hadta draw the pictures of two forty five
71-1_2990.32_1.08.wav_ASR	and i finished it
71-1_2991.6_0.4.wav_ASR	and i said
71-1_2992.42_1.46.wav_ASR	now is this what you wanted
71-1_2994.75_4.17.wav_ASR	or did you want to just look at what you have on the wall that's right there which is a clock
71-1_2999.82_0.95.wav_ASR	and she said
71-1_3001.11_2.02.wav_ASR	well you have passed this test
71-1_3003.49_0.32.wav_ASR	and she said
71-1_3004.28_1.87.wav_ASR	this is essentially a dementia test
71-1_3006.254_13.939.wav_ASR	wow that when you're sixty five and when you go to see an appointment for an annual check you will hafta draw a clock
71-1_3020.834_0.477.wav_ASR	and i said
71-1_3021.514_2.193.wav_ASR	at one point will they stop doing this
71-1_3023.76_9.43.wav_ASR	because while i did indeed grow up with the you know the round clock i use digital
71-1_3033.8_1.68.wav_ASR	everything i do is digital
71-1_3035.807_16.95.wav_ASR	so at what generation will they decide that this is not the way to show that you do not have dementia or beginning dementia or whatever and that you simply have a digital understanding of of what time is
71-1_3053.5_2.36.wav_ASR	so anyway if i do it i'm not gonna do it again
71-1_3056.16_6.11.wav_ASR	maybe i'll just mess with them and just put down some digital stuff and and see what they do with that
71-1_3062.88_3.78.wav_ASR	and i'll have my ppa or something like bruce willis
71-1_3066.9_2.818.wav_ASR	but anyway it's a test that they do
71-1_3069.718_3.888.wav_ASR	and i found it really irritating though i passed
71-1_3074.018_3.915.wav_ASR	but the it's it's gonna be obsolete very very quickly
71-1_3078.438_1.048.wav_ASR	so yep yeah
71-1_3084.638_1.963.wav_ASR	let me see
71-1_3091.487_18.88.wav_ASR	one of the things i useta do when my daughter was younger is every january usually the first week in january we would head together to watch the eagle watch
71-1_3110.83_14.71.wav_ASR	and what the eagle watch was is north of here on the wisconsin river there's one place that in january the eagles are on the way somewhere else
71-1_3125.67_0.72.wav_ASR	so they're coming back
71-1_3126.63_1.247.wav_ASR	they're going south or something
71-1_3127.877_5.666.wav_ASR	but they all show up in this lake for about three or four days
71-1_3134.157_8.44.wav_ASR	and so what people do is they have groups the audubon society and other groups that show up with binoculars
71-1_3144.23_4.65.wav_ASR	and we watch the the birds the eagles because you can see them
71-1_3149.19_1.113.wav_ASR	you can get really really close
71-1_3150.45_1.46.wav_ASR	and you can see the eaglets
71-1_3152.49_1.454.wav_ASR	and you can see them with their mother
71-1_3154.33_2.28.wav_ASR	and and there's just so many of them at one time
71-1_3157.17_2.038.wav_ASR	in wisconsin we have a lot of hawks
71-1_3159.43_4.8.wav_ASR	but we don't necessarily see bald eagles as much
71-1_3164.36_1.23.wav_ASR	it's much more rare
71-1_3166.48_4.788.wav_ASR	so that's something that we did for a number of years
71-1_3171.36_2.94.wav_ASR	even when she was thirteen and wasn't really talking to me anymore
71-1_3174.98_2.763.wav_ASR	we always had fun on that day
71-1_3177.96_0.725.wav_ASR	we would show up
71-1_3179.02_3.122.wav_ASR	we'd first you'd dressed really really warm because it's gonna be twenty below
71-1_3182.59_3.58.wav_ASR	we would go to the banks with binoculars
71-1_3186.63_2.08.wav_ASR	we would wait for the eagles to show up
71-1_3188.91_1.44.wav_ASR	we would watch them for a while
71-1_3190.65_2.38.wav_ASR	and then we would go have hot cocoa
71-1_3193.31_2.86.wav_ASR	and she would talk to me during that timeframe
71-1_3196.61_2.19.wav_ASR	when we were home then it was like
71-1_3199.11_0.88.wav_ASR	oh god she's my mother
71-1_3200.21_0.568.wav_ASR	i'm not talking
71-1_3200.778_1.896.wav_ASR	phone and talk to my friends
71-1_3202.738_13.726.wav_ASR	but there was always that one period even in those very very difficult early teen years that my daughter always talked to me after we watched the eagles
71-1_3216.464_5.16.wav_ASR	so that's one of the things that i would think of when i think of the word birdq
71-1_3227.38_1.01.wav_ASR	wait what was the word again
71-1_3230.244_2.56.wav_ASR	oh i don't know if you wanna hear that story
71-1_3233.039_0.485.wav_ASR	no
71-1_3233.991_2.78.wav_ASR	well i okay
71-1_3236.777_13.094.wav_ASR	i can tell you a a recent one that will clearly not be rated rl or anything like that because really when you start getting that one it could be way more interesting
71-1_3250.021_10.775.wav_ASR	i will talk about something i did last summer which has been since my stroke i've been trying to push myself a little bit
71-1_3260.881_2.569.wav_ASR	and again i'm i'm much more tired than i useta be
71-1_3263.61_5.251.wav_ASR	but i'm still trying to push my boundaries to find out exactly what's possible
71-1_3268.93_1.28.wav_ASR	and how much can i do
71-1_3270.29_1.827.wav_ASR	and how long can i drive
71-1_3272.13_3.6.wav_ASR	and how many hours a day can i you know be active
71-1_3275.741_2.789.wav_ASR	and so i worked with this nonprofit
71-1_3279.53_5.7.wav_ASR	and we were having a event in northern wisconsin off the menominee reservation
71-1_3285.397_2.48.wav_ASR	it's our our group is called waking women healing institute
71-1_3289.337_1.68.wav_ASR	we deal with mmiw issues
71-1_3291.677_3.779.wav_ASR	so i head up for this wellness event
71-1_3295.737_1.06.wav_ASR	and i hadta get up
71-1_3296.957_5.26.wav_ASR	i think i left town at five to get up there by eight
71-1_3302.331_5.519.wav_ASR	we had events all day long and talking and you know different things going on
71-1_3307.891_1.32.wav_ASR	and it was really really hot
71-1_3310.051_3.538.wav_ASR	and i was ready to drive home by five o'clock
71-1_3314.151_2.269.wav_ASR	and about an hour on the way home
71-1_3317.011_2.559.wav_ASR	this is about a three and a half hour trip
71-1_3319.71_2.98.wav_ASR	i decided i can't drive anymore today
71-1_3323.47_1.68.wav_ASR	my head was just pounding
71-1_3326.15_3.68.wav_ASR	i needed to sleep really really quickly
71-1_3329.87_2.42.wav_ASR	and i've learned to listen to myself
71-1_3332.61_4.86.wav_ASR	if my body says you're tired you pull over and you rest
71-1_3337.649_5.112.wav_ASR	you don't just power on through drink some coffee and you know keep on going
71-1_3343.27_1.34.wav_ASR	so i pulled into this hotel
71-1_3345.85_1.66.wav_ASR	and luckily i found one
71-1_3347.849_3.041.wav_ASR	i you know i didn't have a reservation or anything
71-1_3351.11_9.614.wav_ASR	i was just looking for a place that had openings so i could go in and get out of the sun and you know cover my eyes and not hafta drive anymore
71-1_3360.85_10.96.wav_ASR	but because i was as tired as i was and because i was pushed to my boundaries my aphasia had clearly flared up
71-1_3372.95_2.18.wav_ASR	so i walked in this hotel
71-1_3375.69_3.36.wav_ASR	and clearly there were a lot of vacancies
71-1_3379.64_2.57.wav_ASR	well actually i didn't know that right away
71-1_3382.66_1.98.wav_ASR	but i thought it said vacanciesq
71-1_3385.14_0.809.wav_ASR	but i wasn't sure
71-1_3386.18_0.937.wav_ASR	but i walked in the door
71-1_3388.0_2.42.wav_ASR	and there's this woman behind the the desk
71-1_3390.82_0.48.wav_ASR	and i said
71-1_3391.54_2.24.wav_ASR	you know i'm here for a room
71-1_3394.62_0.32.wav_ASR	and i said
71-1_3395.02_1.08.wav_ASR	do you have any vaccinations
71-1_3397.62_5.68.wav_ASR	and and of course that's what happens with aphasia is you say a different word
71-1_3403.92_3.86.wav_ASR	and now vaccinations could have been a response to covid
71-1_3408.16_3.161.wav_ASR	that people are wearing masks
71-1_3411.64_1.783.wav_ASR	and they're being very careful about that
71-1_3413.72_2.58.wav_ASR	so of course i was trying to say
71-1_3416.34_1.56.wav_ASR	do you have a vacancy
71-1_3418.62_1.778.wav_ASR	but what came out is
71-1_3420.7_1.02.wav_ASR	do you have a vaccination
71-1_3422.16_3.26.wav_ASR	and so the woman went into her covid protocol
71-1_3426.26_1.62.wav_ASR	yeah everybody here has been vaccinated
71-1_3428.38_0.711.wav_ASR	we all wear masks
71-1_3429.38_0.988.wav_ASR	we wipe everything down
71-1_3430.72_0.54.wav_ASR	and i'm just saying
71-1_3431.88_0.98.wav_ASR	so you have a room
71-1_3433.14_0.664.wav_ASR	and she said
71-1_3433.92_1.033.wav_ASR	yes yes yes yes
71-1_3435.16_0.545.wav_ASR	and don't worry
71-1_3435.705_1.0.wav_ASR	we followed covid
71-1_3436.845_0.623.wav_ASR	and don't worry
71-1_3437.565_1.797.wav_ASR	you're not gonna get it here
71-1_3439.805_1.863.wav_ASR	and she gave me a room
71-1_3441.825_6.66.wav_ASR	and i realized that was one way to cover things up is you just go with it you know
71-1_3448.76_1.911.wav_ASR	i wanted to ask if she had a vacancy
71-1_3451.44_0.31.wav_ASR	i said
71-1_3452.165_0.98.wav_ASR	do you have a vaccination
71-1_3453.98_1.77.wav_ASR	and so we just went with vaccination
71-1_3456.24_2.03.wav_ASR	and then finally i worked my way back to
71-1_3459.14_2.56.wav_ASR	do you have an empty room that i can sleep in
71-1_3462.68_5.02.wav_ASR	so i got in the room went in drank a lot of cold water and literally slept for twelve hours
71-1_3468.94_0.48.wav_ASR	yeah alright
71-1_3471.54_2.08.wav_ASR	so that's that's another story
71-1_3478.5_0.5.wav_ASR	restaurant
71-1_3480.14_0.8.wav_ASR	okay
71-1_3481.62_20.94.wav_ASR	i guess if i were going to choose something to talk about restaurants i would talk about how i paid my way through my undergrad career which is through waitressing
71-1_3504.63_14.68.wav_ASR	i waitressed beginning at at kind of a little coffee shop that was near where i lived because i had no car
71-1_3520.12_1.31.wav_ASR	and i could just bike there
71-1_3522.42_1.45.wav_ASR	and they were very very kind
71-1_3524.03_2.94.wav_ASR	and i did the breakfast shift
71-1_3528.1_14.32.wav_ASR	but i learned very quickly after about six months that you would get paid ten to fifteen percent as a tip based upon the the prices of the restaurant
71-1_3543.14_8.24.wav_ASR	so what made sense was to find the restaurant that was the most expensive in terms of prices and work there yeah
71-1_3552.167_3.873.wav_ASR	because you're doing the exact same same part of service
71-1_3556.39_19.218.wav_ASR	but if they're only paying five dollars for their meal and they're handing you fifty cents that's not gonna be nearly as good as if they spent twenty dollars for their meal and paid you two or four dollars for it
71-1_3575.98_5.36.wav_ASR	so what i learned to do is keep going to more and more and more expensive restaurants
71-1_3582.46_20.82.wav_ASR	i mean the the the maybe untold story is the waitresses that work in the the the greasy spoon places are just as good if not better than the waitresses in the really highly you know highly priced establishments
71-1_3604.84_2.74.wav_ASR	so that's what i ended up doing
71-1_3608.2_4.664.wav_ASR	and but again it what was so interesting to me is that i worked just as hard
71-1_3613.32_4.157.wav_ASR	and i used you know the
71-1_3618.84_5.61.wav_ASR	you hafta sort of keep a revolving list of tasks that you're in the middle of doing
71-1_3624.45_1.994.wav_ASR	whether you are going to the bar to get drinks
71-1_3626.65_1.508.wav_ASR	or you're going here to get your food
71-1_3628.39_1.405.wav_ASR	or you're gonna go peep on more water
71-1_3630.11_0.946.wav_ASR	or you're gonna give them your check
71-1_3631.51_5.578.wav_ASR	you have to keep them all kind of revolving all at one time
71-1_3637.31_4.757.wav_ASR	and trying to decide exactly how you're going to prioritize each of those tasks
71-1_3642.067_10.0.wav_ASR	being a waitress is a really mentally challenging job
71-1_3653.687_3.66.wav_ASR	it's just bizarre that they don't pay people any money to do that
71-1_3657.49_4.33.wav_ASR	but i was lucky because i made enough money that i was still able to graduate
71-1_3662.01_8.22.wav_ASR	and i wasn't paying the amount of money that grad students and undergrads are paying now which is outrageous
71-1_3672.05_0.61.wav_ASR	but anyway
71-1_3673.93_2.38.wav_ASR	so no student loans for my undergrad
71-1_3676.61_1.701.wav_ASR	graduate school that was very different
71-1_3678.311_5.3.wav_ASR	but yeah i had no student loans because i worked as a waitress in restaurants
71-1_3698.06_0.59.wav_ASR	yeah yeah yeah
71-1_3699.03_2.999.wav_ASR	and it's it's really mentally kind of
71-1_3703.14_1.235.wav_ASR	i've got you know three minutes
71-1_3704.68_0.709.wav_ASR	i can go get that
71-1_3705.62_0.591.wav_ASR	or i can go over here
71-1_3706.54_0.366.wav_ASR	or i can go over here
71-1_3707.62_2.536.wav_ASR	it's it's kind of a challenge
71-1_3710.2_0.816.wav_ASR	it's kind of fun
71-1_3713.34_0.455.wav_ASR	yeah so
71-1_3718.76_0.845.wav_ASR	yeah and you can kinda see
71-1_3719.76_0.59.wav_ASR	and they need water
71-1_3720.7_1.28.wav_ASR	and you need more coffee over there
71-1_3722.26_0.96.wav_ASR	and you got this going on
71-1_3723.52_4.32.wav_ASR	and i will say that the second place i worked i carried a tray
71-1_3728.62_8.414.wav_ASR	and when i went in to get a physical they were trying to figure out why this muscle on this arm was stronger than this one
71-1_3738.16_0.74.wav_ASR	is there something going on
71-1_3739.09_0.75.wav_ASR	is there a growth
71-1_3739.97_0.49.wav_ASR	and i said
71-1_3740.68_1.82.wav_ASR	no i'm just really really strong
71-1_3743.1_1.92.wav_ASR	so yeah so that too
71-1_3753.971_14.825.wav_ASR	well if i were going to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich i would begin by pulling out the bread
71-1_3769.311_2.802.wav_ASR	and taking out two slices of bread
71-1_3772.113_2.019.wav_ASR	and laying them on the table
71-1_3774.633_8.24.wav_ASR	then i would go and get the jar of jelly and the jar of peanut butter butter
71-1_3783.713_4.173.wav_ASR	and i would bring probably a spoon and a knife with me
71-1_3788.57_2.863.wav_ASR	i would begin with the peanut peanut
71-1_3792.068_2.272.wav_ASR	it's really difficult word to say isn't it
71-1_3794.488_0.84.wav_ASR	peanut butter
71-1_3796.268_4.045.wav_ASR	and i would spread that on one side of the bread
71-1_3800.828_3.96.wav_ASR	the other piece of bread i would put on
71-1_3805.108_1.06.wav_ASR	i would use a spoon
71-1_3806.568_1.011.wav_ASR	and i would pull out the jelly
71-1_3807.92_4.373.wav_ASR	and i would spread that evenly on that piece of bread
71-1_3812.7_2.72.wav_ASR	then i would close the two of them together
71-1_3816.12_6.32.wav_ASR	i would close screw the tops back on the jelly and the peanut butter
71-1_3822.66_0.63.wav_ASR	put them away
71-1_3823.88_1.4.wav_ASR	and then i would eat my sandwich
71-1_3832.11_5.6.wav_ASR	well i don't do it often
71-1_3838.45_1.708.wav_ASR	not as often as i should
71-1_3840.85_15.069.wav_ASR	when i do my laundry despite the fact that i do have a washing machine downstairs i tend to go to the laundromat because i can do all of it at one time
71-1_3856.37_2.654.wav_ASR	and i only wanna do it once a week or every other week
71-1_3859.024_4.476.wav_ASR	because it's just something i find kind of boring to do
71-1_3863.904_3.04.wav_ASR	so when i do is
71-1_3868.044_1.74.wav_ASR	in fact i hafta do this tomorrow
71-1_3870.184_1.23.wav_ASR	so let me think about this
71-1_3871.644_3.54.wav_ASR	all of my dirty clothes
71-1_3875.33_5.584.wav_ASR	and i usually use the smell test to find out whether or not they go into the hamper or not
71-1_3880.914_18.7.wav_ASR	mhm when i decide that everything needs to be washed which also will include the towels the washcloths and the other towels cloth handcloths that are hanging up in the kitchen i would put all of them in
71-1_3900.01_5.52.wav_ASR	i would use a container of laundry soap
71-1_3907.24_0.66.wav_ASR	i would put that in
71-1_3908.31_4.39.wav_ASR	i would carry it to the backseat of my car
71-1_3913.6_8.52.wav_ASR	i would make sure i had quarters or had cash that i could use for the quarter machine in the laundromat
71-1_3923.11_1.57.wav_ASR	i would go into the laundromat
71-1_3924.88_6.327.wav_ASR	i would find the largest machine that was available that i could do all of my laundry at one time in one machine
71-1_3931.207_5.18.wav_ASR	i would put the laundry in
71-1_3937.23_12.357.wav_ASR	if they didn't all fit i would make sure that the clothing that could be washed at a lower temperature would go into a separate smaller washing machine
71-1_3950.36_1.814.wav_ASR	i would make sure the soap was in
71-1_3952.46_2.068.wav_ASR	i would make sure i had enough quarters
71-1_3955.36_6.792.wav_ASR	and then i would probably go buy food or something while they're being washed
71-1_3962.36_0.924.wav_ASR	come back
71-1_3963.54_1.44.wav_ASR	put them in the dryer
71-1_3965.86_2.403.wav_ASR	i don't really fold them the way i'm supposed to
71-1_3968.54_0.71.wav_ASR	i just kind of throw them all
71-1_3969.66_4.29.wav_ASR	and then put them away kind of as i use them when i
71-1_3985.92_4.75.wav_ASR	you mean what would i choose to wear or how would i
71-1_3995.3_0.57.wav_ASR	oh i see
71-1_3996.39_11.38.wav_ASR	well the first thing i would do every morning is start my coffee because that really is going to hafta happen before i make decisions about what matches what
71-1_4008.33_2.38.wav_ASR	i will start the water
71-1_4011.9_2.75.wav_ASR	i usually do the pour over system
71-1_4015.51_1.41.wav_ASR	and i have really really good coffee
71-1_4017.61_2.19.wav_ASR	so i usually would grind the coffee
71-1_4020.33_1.78.wav_ASR	start the the water boiling
71-1_4023.83_2.36.wav_ASR	i would go into my bedroom
71-1_4026.63_3.12.wav_ASR	and generally i have some idea of what i'm gonna wear
71-1_4030.63_3.28.wav_ASR	if only because i have to dig stuff out sometimes
71-1_4033.91_1.26.wav_ASR	and i don't wanna have any
71-1_4035.602_4.45.wav_ASR	i don't really have time to look a lot in the morning
71-1_4040.49_2.54.wav_ASR	so i kind of had an idea of what i'm gonna wear already
71-1_4043.51_5.14.wav_ASR	so i usually start well clearly underwear
71-1_4049.59_3.481.wav_ASR	then whatever pants or skirt i'm wearing
71-1_4053.071_3.66.wav_ASR	at that point it the water's usually ready
71-1_4057.231_2.079.wav_ASR	so yeah i got my blinds closed
71-1_4059.631_10.319.wav_ASR	so i'm you know running around here half dressed so i can get my coffee and then figuring out what kind of shirt i'm gonna wear whether and then trying to make decisions about how cold it is
71-1_4070.191_1.359.wav_ASR	do i need to wear a heavy sweater
71-1_4071.75_1.32.wav_ASR	do i need to wear a light one
71-1_4073.07_2.819.wav_ASR	while the coffee's being made
71-1_4076.37_2.828.wav_ASR	by the time the coffee's made i've got all my basic clothes on
71-1_4079.87_6.666.wav_ASR	and then i take the coffee with me in the bathroom when i make decisions about earrings and hair and all that other stuff
71-1_4086.94_4.822.wav_ASR	but yeah the basic is all established the night before so i don't have to worry about it
71-1_4091.79_5.715.wav_ASR	and if i absolutely am tired and don't know what i'm doing i just wear black because it matches everything
71-1_4098.11_1.432.wav_ASR	so i have a lot of black clothes
71-1_4100.07_0.77.wav_ASR	so there's that
71-2_14.77_15.16.wav_ASR	i think my favorite part about where i live and i live on the near east side of madison about a mile away from the capitol is that i'm close to the lake
71-2_30.89_1.34.wav_ASR	now madison is a city
71-2_32.41_2.38.wav_ASR	we we have four different lakes that are here
71-2_35.21_8.54.wav_ASR	and and the madison actually comes from a word from hochunk that actually specifically means four lakesq
71-2_44.69_5.4.wav_ASR	so a block away from where i live is lake minona
71-2_50.725_3.302.wav_ASR	and it's the biggest of the lakes
71-2_54.665_6.7.wav_ASR	and what i like the most about it is there's a bike path to my right
71-2_62.83_6.42.wav_ASR	the lake is to my left with a running path that goes along it
71-2_70.27_7.38.wav_ASR	and i literally can get pretty much everywhere that i need to go in the city of madison without having to drive
71-2_79.43_1.82.wav_ASR	and i'm very close to the lake
71-2_82.17_4.02.wav_ASR	so one of the things i do when i run
71-2_86.95_2.98.wav_ASR	though now i would pretty much call it fast walking
71-2_90.071_3.86.wav_ASR	and not not not from my
71-2_94.531_6.34.wav_ASR	in my prime i would run about seven or eight miles a morning
71-2_100.931_2.26.wav_ASR	and i would get it down to about seven minutes
71-2_103.351_3.4.wav_ASR	now i'm pretty much just walking and jogging
71-2_107.621_3.7.wav_ASR	and we're more like eleven minute miles
71-2_111.741_2.56.wav_ASR	but i usually get about five in every morning
71-2_114.621_7.309.wav_ASR	it's it's it's kind of meditative in the sense that you can look at the water
71-2_122.181_1.029.wav_ASR	you can see the birds
71-2_123.87_10.3.wav_ASR	it's just much more satisfying than it would be to be on a treadmill
71-2_134.77_3.32.wav_ASR	so it's one of the things i really like about where i live
71-2_139.91_1.36.wav_ASR	tread tread treadmill
71-2_142.244_0.5.wav_ASR	treadmill
71-2_144.217_0.467.wav_ASR	okay
71-2_144.93_1.073.wav_ASR	i don't think that i'm
71-2_146.764_2.154.wav_ASR	i'm not sure that's the right word that i mean
71-2_149.284_0.5.wav_ASR	treadmill
71-2_153.748_0.593.wav_ASR	no it is a treadmill treadmill
71-2_155.384_1.306.wav_ASR	yeah i just see the word
71-2_156.884_0.526.wav_ASR	but i kept saying
71-2_157.764_1.566.wav_ASR	somehow i'm screwing that word up somehow
71-2_159.584_0.92.wav_ASR	but no i wasn't
71-2_160.706_2.562.wav_ASR	sometimes i hear a word that i already know
71-2_163.426_0.544.wav_ASR	and i keep saying
71-2_164.206_1.044.wav_ASR	i bet i'm saying that wrong
71-2_165.746_4.624.wav_ASR	but i i just have to be reacquainted with words that i actually already know
71-2_171.106_0.564.wav_ASR	so yeah
71-2_173.086_3.54.wav_ASR	running along the lake is much better than being on a treadmill
71-2_177.146_2.769.wav_ASR	and i live a block away which is why i like living here
71-2_179.915_0.5.wav_ASR	yeah
71-2_200.31_2.58.wav_ASR	again my speech is not reliable
71-2_204.23_8.987.wav_ASR	for the most part when i speak i know what i'm going to say
71-2_213.77_16.481.wav_ASR	but if i try to say something that's more complicated something that is explaining something in more detail or becomes more abstract abstract my words don't come out the way that i like to say them
71-2_230.251_8.589.wav_ASR	or the words are in my brain but i'm not quite able to articulate them the way that i want to
71-2_238.97_3.38.wav_ASR	generally i know right away when i've made a mistake
71-2_243.091_1.339.wav_ASR	but sometimes i don't
71-2_244.631_2.0.wav_ASR	yesterday i i said to someone
71-2_246.696_3.48.wav_ASR	well we've got this election coming up on january fourth
71-2_250.676_1.27.wav_ASR	and she said
71-2_253.536_0.404.wav_ASR	january fourth
71-2_253.94_0.621.wav_ASR	it's april
71-2_254.576_0.84.wav_ASR	and i said
71-2_255.492_0.747.wav_ASR	what did i say
71-2_256.376_0.528.wav_ASR	and she said
71-2_256.996_0.815.wav_ASR	you said januaryq
71-2_258.98_1.021.wav_ASR	well it feels like january
71-2_260.696_3.525.wav_ASR	and again i try to just wing those and figure out a way to get past it
71-2_264.41_8.22.wav_ASR	but i simply cannot trust that what will come out of my mouth is what i'm actually trying to say
71-2_273.01_14.82.wav_ASR	and i don't know how to fix that except just to keep trying to reinstall those language pathways that have been disrupted and try to catch them faster i guess
71-2_295.73_2.62.wav_ASR	yes i remember exactly when i had a stroke
71-2_298.52_5.42.wav_ASR	i had a stroke on january first twenty twenty one
71-2_320.33_14.302.wav_ASR	so i essentially had a thunder clap headache to my right temporal lobe and did not know what it was for two days
71-2_335.13_1.573.wav_ASR	and then of course they admitted me
71-2_336.703_9.4.wav_ASR	but it was past the window of opportunity to be able to give me some type of drugs that might have broken up the clot earlier
71-2_347.563_2.227.wav_ASR	so i entered the hospital
71-2_350.403_1.92.wav_ASR	they assumed i would have another stroke
71-2_353.183_0.607.wav_ASR	i have not
71-2_354.09_4.36.wav_ASR	and they have not been able to find the cause of the initial stroke
71-2_359.72_1.67.wav_ASR	i assume it was the perfect storm
71-2_362.04_12.44.wav_ASR	i assume it might have been a combination of working out really hard being stressed because of the pandemic and not being able to have christmas
71-2_374.76_2.765.wav_ASR	those were prevaccination days
71-2_378.52_3.0.wav_ASR	so we were in a position then where it was pretty isolated
71-2_381.743_3.632.wav_ASR	and i don't know what else it could have been
71-2_385.583_5.67.wav_ASR	literally there's there is physically nothing wrong with my body
71-2_391.703_3.994.wav_ASR	and all of my numbers indicate that i should not have a stroke
71-2_395.843_2.223.wav_ASR	and yet yet i had a stroke
71-2_398.363_1.62.wav_ASR	so yeah anyway
71-2_400.181_2.92.wav_ASR	cryptogenic cryptogenic stroke
71-2_403.981_4.263.wav_ASR	which at some point i you just move on with it i guess
71-2_408.721_0.379.wav_ASR	yeah
71-2_418.32_17.68.wav_ASR	well as i said a week ago most of the recovery has been selfinitiated and has not been done through the direction of therapy or help from any medical professionals
71-2_437.57_8.66.wav_ASR	and i think that that's kind of a travesty in the sense that people have that have had
71-2_446.73_3.68.wav_ASR	and i was characterized as having a mild ischemic stroke
71-2_451.57_12.92.wav_ASR	we are in the position or the potential to completely recover if we're given the right interventions and right kinds of treatment within certain timeframes
71-2_464.99_16.04.wav_ASR	i think the first six months after stroke is really crucial in terms of rapid recovery because you're building on the spontaneous recovery that that your your brain is able to generate to bring back language
71-2_482.13_11.14.wav_ASR	i'm really disappointed in the american health insurance industry in the sense that i was not given what i should have gotten
71-2_493.53_18.08.wav_ASR	so what i've done on my own is really increased my my the quality of my diet which was already mediterranean mediterranean style of of of diet
71-2_511.89_1.417.wav_ASR	i've always observed that
71-2_513.307_1.654.wav_ASR	i've been doing that for about ten years
71-2_515.327_10.103.wav_ASR	i gave up drinking completely though i don't really think that was an issue since i was drinking maybe one glass a month
71-2_525.43_10.02.wav_ASR	but it might increase inflammation inflammation inflammation
71-2_536.21_4.1.wav_ASR	it might increase inflammation in my body
71-2_540.325_10.3.wav_ASR	and that's something that i'm trying to work very strongly to make sure that i have an antiinflammation diet
71-2_551.465_1.7.wav_ASR	i've increased my exercise
71-2_553.585_1.6.wav_ASR	but again i've already exercised
71-2_559.81_19.778.wav_ASR	i've increased the very conscious cognitive tests that i do every single day to make sure that i can make sure that my focus and concentration levels are relatively high
71-2_579.588_2.895.wav_ASR	again i was an academic
71-2_582.748_15.385.wav_ASR	so i have always done a lot of reading every day done a lot of writing every day doing a lot of close work every day trying to develop and weave arguments together every single day
71-2_598.133_2.617.wav_ASR	but i've done it much more consciously than in the past
71-2_601.85_7.16.wav_ASR	writing is always reliable in the sense that i have the option of editing
71-2_609.473_2.297.wav_ASR	and i do sometimes use the wrong word
71-2_612.753_2.617.wav_ASR	but i generally catch it when i edit it
71-2_615.79_3.34.wav_ASR	and i always hadta edit before the stroke too
71-2_619.37_9.39.wav_ASR	so i don't know to what extent those mistakes are connected to the stroke effects or whether that's just the way that i write
71-2_628.91_4.36.wav_ASR	sometimes you do a a rough draft to get the ideas out
71-2_633.443_2.915.wav_ASR	and then you refine it the second time around
71-2_637.303_9.727.wav_ASR	so i i i think the only real difference from the way in which i live my life after the stroke than before is making sure that i always get enough sleep
71-2_647.963_4.187.wav_ASR	before the stroke i tried to get sleep
71-2_652.45_7.12.wav_ASR	but if i didn't i just powered on because i have a schedule that i hafta observe
71-2_660.87_8.901.wav_ASR	now it's it's a priority for me to the extent that i have available to me to make sure that i sleep as much as i can
71-2_670.05_5.06.wav_ASR	but other than that i just have a regimen every single day that i've always done
71-2_676.49_0.563.wav_ASR	eat really well
71-2_677.41_1.165.wav_ASR	exercise every day
71-2_679.05_2.72.wav_ASR	push my brain as much as i can
71-2_682.23_7.28.wav_ASR	i may attempt to take back up a language skill
71-2_689.79_3.4.wav_ASR	i was taking spanish classes before the stroke
71-2_693.397_2.653.wav_ASR	i took french when i was in high school
71-2_696.33_3.6.wav_ASR	and i picked up a little bit of danish when i lived in copenhagen
71-2_701.01_4.263.wav_ASR	but i thought spanish would be much more useful than french is
71-2_706.37_2.1.wav_ASR	so i started taking a spanish class
71-2_708.69_4.73.wav_ASR	and i hadta discontinue it because it was late at night
71-2_713.57_1.99.wav_ASR	and it just really wasn't working out for me
71-2_716.7_10.19.wav_ASR	but from what i've read recently i think one of the things that might be really helpful to reestablish my english is to pick up spanish
71-2_727.56_1.88.wav_ASR	it's i you know i don't know
71-2_729.6_1.14.wav_ASR	i thought it might be confusing
71-2_731.12_2.971.wav_ASR	but why not try it you know
71-2_734.091_1.949.wav_ASR	why not see what happens
71-2_736.54_3.066.wav_ASR	so yeah that may be what i do next i think
71-2_739.76_1.333.wav_ASR	beyond what i'm already doing
71-2_767.08_3.158.wav_ASR	let me see
71-2_771.54_4.68.wav_ASR	happy sad significant
71-2_779.25_0.7.wav_ASR	alright
71-2_782.83_5.9.wav_ASR	i'm gonna talk about my reaction to what happened on nine eleven in two thousand and one
71-2_790.19_2.46.wav_ASR	i was teaching
71-2_793.11_3.98.wav_ASR	it was the beginning of a the spring semester in two thousand and one
71-2_797.09_4.16.wav_ASR	and my daughter had gone to school
71-2_803.03_9.82.wav_ASR	so as soon as she left at at about eight fifteen i got on the computer because i hadta finish my syllabus
71-2_813.15_3.66.wav_ASR	yes i i should have already finished my syllabus
71-2_817.67_1.9.wav_ASR	and it was generally done
71-2_819.73_2.089.wav_ASR	but i was kinda playing with some of the end of it
71-2_822.23_5.923.wav_ASR	my ethnic politics class because i just wanted to just update it a little bit
71-2_828.41_1.08.wav_ASR	so i wasn't online
71-2_830.33_2.92.wav_ASR	obviously the radio wasn't on because i hadta concentrate
71-2_833.352_4.423.wav_ASR	or i certainly wasn't watching television when i was trying to do my work
71-2_837.872_12.614.wav_ASR	so i was in this zone of silence with no connection to the outside whatsoever just going through these different articles and deciding which one would fit best in terms of what i was trying to do
71-2_851.51_5.54.wav_ASR	and at two o'clock in the afternoon i was gonna take a break
71-2_857.21_3.32.wav_ASR	i was going to go to my gym and workout
71-2_861.07_1.14.wav_ASR	and it was a beautiful day
71-2_862.61_1.64.wav_ASR	it was you know september eleventh
71-2_868.85_0.8.wav_ASR	and i turned on the radio
71-2_870.87_3.98.wav_ASR	and the announcer said
71-2_875.69_2.16.wav_ASR	i don't really know if the schools are gonna close
71-2_878.53_0.64.wav_ASR	and i kept saying
71-2_879.77_1.12.wav_ASR	the schools are gonna close
71-2_881.09_0.48.wav_ASR	why would
71-2_888.143_3.145.wav_ASR	and i got to the the gym
71-2_892.33_2.473.wav_ASR	and there were televisions everywhere
71-2_895.423_2.206.wav_ASR	they were in the desk when you come in
71-2_897.723_1.36.wav_ASR	and that never exists
71-2_899.443_1.827.wav_ASR	and everybody looked really really upset
71-2_901.963_1.96.wav_ASR	so i i'm walking in there saying
71-2_904.483_2.874.wav_ASR	something happened here that i don't know about
71-2_907.37_1.5.wav_ASR	but everybody else knows about this
71-2_909.35_2.12.wav_ASR	and they're all staring at these screens
71-2_911.55_3.34.wav_ASR	so i went to the section where my treadmill was
71-2_915.83_3.818.wav_ASR	and again the treadmills were not anywhere near as running along the lake
71-2_919.77_3.262.wav_ASR	but that's what i was gonna do that day because i hadta do some lifting
71-2_923.27_1.915.wav_ASR	and that's when i saw it
71-2_925.185_12.8.wav_ASR	at that point by two o'clock in the afternoon they were just replaying it over and over and over again about the two planes that were hitting the the twin towers in new york
71-2_938.265_2.813.wav_ASR	and they were interviewing people who were trying to get away
71-2_941.365_1.64.wav_ASR	and everything is covered with ashes
71-2_944.49_6.22.wav_ASR	and i remember getting on the the treadmill and you know putting on my headphones and listening to it
71-2_951.07_7.56.wav_ASR	and i just kept going faster and faster and faster because the adrenaline of what had happened was just so shocking
71-2_959.41_3.86.wav_ASR	so i kind of used that you know to increase my workout
71-2_963.53_2.82.wav_ASR	and i got out of there
71-2_966.61_1.02.wav_ASR	and i went home and said
71-2_967.91_0.384.wav_ASR	wait a minute
71-2_968.294_4.966.wav_ASR	i've got a really close friend that lives in dc that works near the pentagon
71-2_973.35_2.086.wav_ASR	so is he okay
71-2_975.69_0.829.wav_ASR	what's going on
71-2_977.21_0.94.wav_ASR	so i tried to call
71-2_978.45_3.78.wav_ASR	and of course i couldn't get through because all the the signals were were down
71-2_982.23_3.06.wav_ASR	noone could get home in dc
71-2_985.57_1.836.wav_ASR	everything was shut down
71-2_988.71_2.16.wav_ASR	i got online
71-2_991.09_0.94.wav_ASR	and i started emailing
71-2_992.31_1.48.wav_ASR	and then i emailed my department
71-2_993.97_1.78.wav_ASR	i was in the political science department
71-2_995.93_0.34.wav_ASR	and said
71-2_996.81_2.067.wav_ASR	okay we're gonna have a panel on campus
71-2_999.41_1.76.wav_ASR	we're gonna invite the community
71-2_1001.32_2.481.wav_ASR	and we're going to explain what is going on
71-2_1004.36_5.934.wav_ASR	in be we're gonna explain all of it
71-2_1010.3_3.871.wav_ASR	we're gonna explain the the ramifications of it
71-2_1014.18_3.5.wav_ASR	we're gonna talk about the history of afghanistan
71-2_1018.48_2.588.wav_ASR	we're gonna explain exactly what is going on here
71-2_1021.068_3.442.wav_ASR	and everybody got back to me immediately
71-2_1024.788_2.32.wav_ASR	i mean they everyone responded and said
71-2_1027.288_1.502.wav_ASR	yeah i'd be happy to talk about this
71-2_1029.048_5.302.wav_ASR	and i'd be happy to talk about the sanctions in iraq that are going on currently
71-2_1034.35_7.22.wav_ASR	and maybe that's related to what's going on with the the the the bombers that are
71-2_1041.762_18.784.wav_ASR	we all we knew at that point that they were coming from the middle east and that they were attacking the united states and the pentagon and the world trade center as symbols of empire and the western culture i guess
71-2_1060.546_2.0.wav_ASR	and and how it is that we're
71-2_1063.386_1.58.wav_ASR	why they were enemies with us
71-2_1066.026_2.694.wav_ASR	so yeah it all came together really quickly
71-2_1069.006_1.514.wav_ASR	i went to bed at one o'clock in the morning
71-2_1071.126_4.007.wav_ASR	finally got an email back from my friend in dc who was fine
71-2_1075.986_3.141.wav_ASR	and got up went to campus the next day
71-2_1079.127_3.12.wav_ASR	and all the the lectures were just scrapped
71-2_1082.467_8.34.wav_ASR	and all we did is talk about what happened in every single class hour after hour after hour after hour after hour
71-2_1091.927_2.073.wav_ASR	okay alright well that's that's a lot there
71-2_1094.327_0.6.wav_ASR	but yeah
71-2_1095.507_3.195.wav_ASR	it was a great panel by the way
71-2_1098.702_2.177.wav_ASR	i think we had five hundred people
71-2_1101.002_4.48.wav_ASR	we had standing room standing standing
71-2_1106.562_0.607.wav_ASR	what am i trying to say
71-2_1107.262_1.0.wav_ASR	standing
71-2_1108.642_3.021.wav_ASR	people hadta stand in the back
71-2_1111.942_1.56.wav_ASR	but what i'm trying to say is standing room onlyq
71-2_1115.89_2.82.wav_ASR	i have all these phrases that i useta be able to say
71-2_1118.87_0.92.wav_ASR	and i start to say them
71-2_1119.99_1.393.wav_ASR	and i forget what they are in the middle
71-2_1122.11_1.8.wav_ASR	standing room only
71-2_1124.33_0.389.wav_ASR	yeah
71-2_1124.719_2.671.wav_ASR	we filled up the place basically and had lots of questions
71-2_1127.69_1.1.wav_ASR	and everybody's question
71-2_1129.59_0.76.wav_ASR	why do they hate us
71-2_1130.57_2.4.wav_ASR	and that's what we began with
71-2_1133.59_0.94.wav_ASR	so yeah alright
71-2_1136.424_12.445.wav_ASR	yeah other than i missed the whole thing because of course i was online writing a lecture that i never gave because you know circumstances took over from where we were
71-2_1189.34_19.84.wav_ASR	well it seems to be taking place in a neighborhood a neighborhood which is relatively in the suburbs because the homes are relatively close to each other
71-2_1209.06_5.336.wav_ASR	and it looks like what's going on is a boy is in the backyard
71-2_1214.88_2.2.wav_ASR	and he's playing with his soccer ball
71-2_1217.52_1.92.wav_ASR	he's practicing his kick
71-2_1220.38_11.126.wav_ASR	and unfortunately this time the ball does not go where he hoped it would go and crashes into the window
71-2_1232.06_5.1.wav_ASR	and it looks like it might have been the window of his next door neighbor
71-2_1237.38_1.26.wav_ASR	but it could have been his father too
71-2_1238.86_0.86.wav_ASR	it's difficult to know
71-2_1239.78_7.2.wav_ASR	but it was a window that was next to the yard in which he was playing with his soccer ball
71-2_1247.88_3.96.wav_ASR	well it hit the the glass of the window and broke it
71-2_1252.48_4.08.wav_ASR	and unfortunately there was a man that was sitting in the chair right next to the window
71-2_1257.78_7.66.wav_ASR	and the soccer ball not only broke the window but went through completely into the the house
71-2_1266.32_2.88.wav_ASR	so apparently they have no screens from what i'm guessing
71-2_1269.48_2.687.wav_ASR	so it can't be wisconsin because we have mosquitoes here
71-2_1272.167_11.407.wav_ASR	in any case the ball ended up in the house in the room directly where the man was sitting
71-2_1284.62_3.27.wav_ASR	and he was not pleased about this
71-2_1288.15_5.76.wav_ASR	he stood up and looked out the window to try to figure out who had broken the window
71-2_1294.2_1.43.wav_ASR	where did the ball come from
71-2_1295.93_9.0.wav_ASR	and who is the person who had directed that ball toward his window
71-2_1305.71_7.06.wav_ASR	he's it's clearly that there's going to be some kind of ramifications as a result of this
71-2_1313.51_3.88.wav_ASR	because if it's his son his son is going to be scolded
71-2_1317.638_12.22.wav_ASR	and if it's his neighbor he's gonna expect an apology and probably some sort of payment to repair the the glass that's been broken
71-2_1331.61_2.368.wav_ASR	so drama in the suburbs
71-2_1351.36_23.18.wav_ASR	well we're gonna title this story mother knows best which is a a play on the fact that there apparently was a much older television show which was called father knows best which i think is from the nineteen fifties or sixties
71-2_1374.637_1.24.wav_ASR	and it was very patriarchal
71-2_1376.717_2.203.wav_ASR	and you know the father leaves
71-2_1379.217_1.12.wav_ASR	the mother is the housewife
71-2_1380.877_2.16.wav_ASR	father knows best
71-2_1383.339_19.92.wav_ASR	in any case this particular story is gonna be mother knows best which is probably significantly more contemporary and maybe universal in the sense that mothers generally i would say as a general rule know better than their children
71-2_1403.327_4.073.wav_ASR	not always but in this particular case that's exactly what's happening
71-2_1407.4_17.237.wav_ASR	and and what's going on is this child and this child's mother is debating over whether this boy needs to take an umbrella with him when he leaves
71-2_1424.637_5.175.wav_ASR	because they're getting ready for the boy to go off on his own
71-2_1430.477_1.44.wav_ASR	and the mother is saying
71-2_1432.357_10.134.wav_ASR	based upon what we see with the clouds that are outside in the the sky and what we see on the weather reports it looks like it's gonna rain
71-2_1442.577_1.295.wav_ASR	so i think you should take an umbrella
71-2_1443.872_2.02.wav_ASR	and the little boy is going like
71-2_1446.272_1.58.wav_ASR	i am not taking an umbrella
71-2_1448.132_1.546.wav_ASR	i don't need one
71-2_1450.032_1.204.wav_ASR	i don't care if it rains
71-2_1451.572_0.969.wav_ASR	i'm not gonna melt
71-2_1453.572_2.904.wav_ASR	i i'm fine on my own
71-2_1457.132_0.708.wav_ASR	so she says
71-2_1458.152_1.904.wav_ASR	well alright you know best
71-2_1460.812_1.116.wav_ASR	she says goodbye to him
71-2_1462.212_0.403.wav_ASR	he leaves
71-2_1462.615_2.1.wav_ASR	she's still holding the umbrella
71-2_1465.335_0.768.wav_ASR	he heads out
71-2_1466.655_2.06.wav_ASR	and it's not just a sprinkle
71-2_1468.935_3.82.wav_ASR	but it really really starts to rain really hard
71-2_1472.915_1.22.wav_ASR	it's a downpour
71-2_1475.7_2.625.wav_ASR	and he doesn't have a hat
71-2_1478.655_2.945.wav_ASR	so the rain is getting his eyes
71-2_1481.94_2.26.wav_ASR	and he's getting really really really wet
71-2_1484.32_4.93.wav_ASR	and his clothes are getting drenched and saturated with the water
71-2_1489.82_1.78.wav_ASR	so he gets about half a block
71-2_1492.22_1.78.wav_ASR	and he can't even see what's going on
71-2_1494.3_3.58.wav_ASR	so he heads back to his mother very quickly
71-2_1499.24_0.76.wav_ASR	she looks at him
71-2_1501.22_2.46.wav_ASR	she has the grace not to say
71-2_1503.88_0.744.wav_ASR	i told you so
71-2_1505.06_1.279.wav_ASR	because mothers know best
71-2_1506.48_1.32.wav_ASR	and they know that that never works
71-2_1508.74_1.78.wav_ASR	and he stands there and looks at her
71-2_1510.86_1.98.wav_ASR	and she hands him the umbrella
71-2_1513.76_0.96.wav_ASR	and he heads off again
71-2_1515.14_3.02.wav_ASR	and this time remembering in his brain
71-2_1519.26_3.04.wav_ASR	my mother's not always wrong about everything
71-2_1524.14_4.02.wav_ASR	and let but of course he forgets it by the next week when something else comes up
71-2_1528.48_7.687.wav_ASR	but where we are in this week he is now assured that his mother actually has wisdom which he does not yet have
71-2_1536.5_2.081.wav_ASR	alright mother knows best
71-2_1555.22_3.121.wav_ASR	well speaking of drama in the neighborhood
71-2_1559.54_8.9.wav_ASR	what had happened here began because the cat was sitting on the porch
71-2_1569.36_3.67.wav_ASR	and the cat has the right to sit sit on the the porch
71-2_1573.78_3.17.wav_ASR	but the next door neighbor has the dog
71-2_1576.95_6.958.wav_ASR	and the dog came out and immediately saw the cat and ran over and started barking at the cat
71-2_1584.11_1.22.wav_ASR	and the cat was spooked
71-2_1586.07_5.36.wav_ASR	so the cat ran from the the dog and ran up the tree because that was close
71-2_1591.15_6.0.wav_ASR	and that was a way to get away from the dog because the dog couldn't climb
71-2_1597.65_2.042.wav_ASR	so the cat climbed up the tree
71-2_1600.41_0.894.wav_ASR	but it's a young cat
71-2_1601.49_6.55.wav_ASR	it's a cat that's just barely a kitten and isn't really accustomed to being that high up
71-2_1608.43_1.61.wav_ASR	so the cat crawled up
71-2_1610.78_6.66.wav_ASR	the little girl ran out saw her cat was up in the tree and called her father and said
71-2_1619.16_1.18.wav_ASR	my cat is up in the tree
71-2_1621.04_3.96.wav_ASR	and she's out on the far limbs
71-2_1625.76_9.82.wav_ASR	and it doesn't look like she's finding her way to get back out because she's meowing you know very loudly and clearly wants to be rescued
71-2_1636.4_1.22.wav_ASR	so please help me
71-2_1638.16_2.86.wav_ASR	please help me get my cat out of the tree
71-2_1641.3_3.6.wav_ASR	well the father's trying to be chivalrous and big hero
71-2_1645.16_4.36.wav_ASR	so he immediately goes into the garage and finds his ladder
71-2_1650.2_21.487.wav_ASR	and the plan for him was he would simply be able to climb up the the ladder get to the tree inch his way up to the limb where the cat was grab it probably put it inside his shirt crawl down and hand it to his daughter
71-2_1671.68_2.39.wav_ASR	and then he could be you know the hero
71-2_1674.76_5.62.wav_ASR	he could fulfill his daughter's request
71-2_1681.42_2.26.wav_ASR	well unfortunately he got up in the tree
71-2_1684.54_10.49.wav_ASR	and the he hadn't securely rested the ladder against the tree in the way he really needed to
71-2_1695.33_1.1.wav_ASR	and it fell down
71-2_1697.33_4.1.wav_ASR	so now we have two people that hafta be rescued from the tree
71-2_1701.65_7.1.wav_ASR	we have the cat that is still meowing loudly out in the far limbs
71-2_1709.29_12.14.wav_ASR	and of course the father can't reach it because he's his weight is too heavy to be able to move into those limbs without breaking them down
71-2_1721.65_1.78.wav_ASR	and then he would fall down and get hurt
71-2_1724.19_6.76.wav_ASR	so at this point the mother who knows best has called the fire department and said
71-2_1731.81_2.587.wav_ASR	we've got a cluster fuck going on here
71-2_1734.59_1.211.wav_ASR	that that isn't what she said
71-2_1735.801_6.58.wav_ASR	but that's what she thought in her brain because she didn't say the words in front of her children because she doesn't want them to know about profanity
71-2_1742.881_2.24.wav_ASR	can you please bring
71-2_1745.553_16.023.wav_ASR	unfortunately we now need help from firefighters to not only get the cat out of the tree but my husband who tried to climb up to help rescue the the cat
71-2_1761.576_6.523.wav_ASR	and my daughter is still sobbing because she's worried about the cat
71-2_1768.376_1.494.wav_ASR	and now she's worried about her dad
71-2_1770.876_2.274.wav_ASR	and the dog is still barking
71-2_1773.756_3.1.wav_ASR	now at this point what she should be doing is she's about ready
71-2_1777.576_1.228.wav_ASR	because the firefighters are here
71-2_1779.076_1.061.wav_ASR	and they're coming over
71-2_1780.05_2.35.wav_ASR	and they're going to help the man get down first
71-2_1782.71_3.09.wav_ASR	and then they're going to reach out and get the cat
71-2_1786.3_8.752.wav_ASR	and what the mother's gonna do is she's gonna go and grab the dog and put him in the other room so that everybody will relax a bit
71-2_1796.11_3.213.wav_ASR	and everybody can make it out of the tree without getting hurt
71-2_1799.323_1.586.wav_ASR	the end
71-2_2004.09_16.38.wav_ASR	and what we're essentially looking for here is economic mobility and social mobility and what the criteria is that women have to possess in order to improve their situation in society
71-2_2021.77_1.86.wav_ASR	so we're gonna start with that
71-2_2023.99_13.24.wav_ASR	and this is an example of the very restrictive roles that were available to women in certain cultures in certain societies
71-2_2038.46_5.74.wav_ASR	now what we're seeing here are a family which is relatively middle class
71-2_2045.26_10.16.wav_ASR	and the in both cases what we had were two families with children
71-2_2056.56_3.02.wav_ASR	and each of them had a spouse that died
71-2_2061.01_13.758.wav_ASR	the husband had one daughter who was living with him
71-2_2075.16_1.256.wav_ASR	but his wife had died
71-2_2076.416_3.656.wav_ASR	so he had a a young daughter who was about six years old
71-2_2080.296_11.24.wav_ASR	and again in a european society of nineteenth century men could not raise their own children
71-2_2091.936_1.731.wav_ASR	they had to have a woman
71-2_2093.856_0.741.wav_ASR	that was her role
71-2_2094.68_3.78.wav_ASR	people were relatively rigid in terms of what they were allowed to do
71-2_2099.12_3.78.wav_ASR	so he hadta find a wife in order to care for his daughter
71-2_2103.96_13.22.wav_ASR	on in a another part of town relatively same social status we have man and woman a man and and wife who had two children
71-2_2118.02_0.76.wav_ASR	and he died
71-2_2119.64_8.66.wav_ASR	so the only way that she would be able to survive as a female is to find a widower or find another man that would marry her
71-2_2129.4_2.86.wav_ASR	so they're both out looking for another spouse
71-2_2133.36_1.3.wav_ASR	and they meet each other
71-2_2135.0_28.16.wav_ASR	and of course what the widower is looking for is someone that will take care of his house will treat his daughter as a mother and you know will do all the other things that women are supposta do and that men don't do because we have very restricted very very different differentiated social roles that they operate in this society
71-2_2164.74_1.14.wav_ASR	so they meet each other
71-2_2166.5_3.74.wav_ASR	and he's gotten the impression that she's gonna be a wonderful wife
71-2_2170.64_3.8.wav_ASR	she's certainly gushes all over his daughter
71-2_2175.66_1.62.wav_ASR	and so they they marry
71-2_2177.28_12.12.wav_ASR	there are now three children two daughters from her original family his daughter named cinderella from his family
71-2_2189.86_2.76.wav_ASR	and they've now blended into this new society
71-2_2193.69_11.26.wav_ASR	the father then fulfills his role which is go out and make money for the family and leaves the house under the management of the stepmother
71-2_2205.31_21.673.wav_ASR	the stepmother on the other hand has not fulfilled her promise to mother the stepdaughter but instead has decided that she's she's going to favor her birth daughters and is going to treat the other stepdaughter as if she's a maid
71-2_2227.87_6.94.wav_ASR	and for whatever reason the father does not interfere in what he sees when he is home
71-2_2235.41_10.02.wav_ASR	and so what we have is this this really terrible society this really terrible situation that exists for cinderella
71-2_2245.527_4.893.wav_ASR	cinderella again had had a a beautiful mother who loved her
71-2_2250.667_1.201.wav_ASR	she was close to her father
71-2_2252.027_0.76.wav_ASR	she lost her mother
71-2_2253.147_9.1.wav_ASR	and now she's also in this situation where she's clearly treated differently than her stepsisters stepsisters
71-2_2262.887_2.555.wav_ASR	semantic paraphasic error
71-2_2265.442_1.074.wav_ASR	happens all the time
71-2_2267.022_0.954.wav_ASR	anyway moving on
71-2_2269.122_1.278.wav_ASR	again they live in a society
71-2_2270.462_8.32.wav_ASR	there's no way that women can improve their their position in this society except through marriage
71-2_2279.762_2.46.wav_ASR	it's the only possible option to them
71-2_2282.222_18.073.wav_ASR	and so their primary role growing up is to learn how to manage a house and also be attractive to the heterosexual partners that are available to them
71-2_2300.295_2.36.wav_ASR	and i don't know what happens if they're not heterosexual
71-2_2303.295_2.211.wav_ASR	i i guess they just fake it
71-2_2305.815_2.972.wav_ASR	in any case that's not part of this particular story
71-2_2309.455_1.22.wav_ASR	she's straight
71-2_2310.915_3.032.wav_ASR	and so that's one complication she doesn't have to deal with
71-2_2313.947_8.6.wav_ASR	in any case on the other side of the city at a higher class is royalty
71-2_2323.465_20.82.wav_ASR	and again while the prince has essentially a lot of economic power and he's at the top of his cultural and social status he's also obligated to marry
71-2_2344.363_9.7.wav_ASR	because the plan is that he will marry a wife and that wife will then bear him children
71-2_2354.443_6.44.wav_ASR	and those children then means that there will be a lineage that will continue on to the next generation
71-2_2361.383_1.861.wav_ASR	so he may not wanna get married
71-2_2363.24_6.92.wav_ASR	and we don't really know what his gender identity is or orientation is
71-2_2370.56_2.72.wav_ASR	but he's he understands what his job is
71-2_2373.42_1.38.wav_ASR	he hasta find a woman
71-2_2375.14_1.42.wav_ASR	he hasta find a partner
71-2_2377.46_11.7.wav_ASR	and his plan is to find someone who's relatively attractive while he fulfills the obligations of his office in the restrictive social structure in which they exist
71-2_2389.76_4.76.wav_ASR	so the plan is he's gonna get this over with quickly
71-2_2394.609_4.6.wav_ASR	is they're gonna have this huge dance this huge ball
71-2_2400.449_1.88.wav_ASR	and everyone in the kingdom
71-2_2403.749_2.623.wav_ASR	i i'm assuming we're pretty much middle class and above
71-2_2406.669_3.7.wav_ASR	he's not really going to the peasant track class
71-2_2410.569_1.731.wav_ASR	that's not part of this at all
71-2_2413.36_14.64.wav_ASR	is inviting all of the eligible females who are not married who would like to be married to come and audition for him so that he can walk through and make his choices
71-2_2429.0_1.96.wav_ASR	and again this is clearly degrading
71-2_2432.56_5.54.wav_ASR	it's almost like that bachelor show which i've never seen and never would see
71-2_2438.84_2.588.wav_ASR	but i certainly know aware of it
71-2_2441.428_16.26.wav_ASR	that the women are gonna be tested and graded and chosen out of a a line of other available women to be able to be the one that he is deciding he's going to mate with permanently
71-2_2458.96_11.18.wav_ASR	so anyway all three of these women the two stepsisters and cinderella all know that they are eligible
71-2_2470.64_6.62.wav_ASR	and they all start thinking about how wonderful their the situation would be if they get chosen
71-2_2477.759_2.965.wav_ASR	and again what's interesting is we're not talking about love
71-2_2480.919_2.54.wav_ASR	we're not talking about you know likeness
71-2_2485.819_3.132.wav_ASR	we're not talking about people that are compatible with each other
71-2_2489.099_5.541.wav_ASR	we're talking about they will somehow be attractive enough for this male to choose them
71-2_2495.14_6.668.wav_ASR	and then their life situation will improve because those are the only options that are available to them
71-2_2502.2_11.34.wav_ASR	again it's a very restrictive society in a a certain time in in culture which is very very limiting for female potential
71-2_2514.72_1.813.wav_ASR	so they're they're all getting ready
71-2_2516.76_1.25.wav_ASR	and they know what they hafta do
71-2_2518.04_0.98.wav_ASR	they hafta look attractive
71-2_2519.46_1.52.wav_ASR	so they hafta have a really nice dress
71-2_2521.32_1.34.wav_ASR	and their hair hasta be fixed up
71-2_2522.8_14.67.wav_ASR	and they hafta somehow make them stand out from the others in order to be chosen in this degrading heterosexual contest that they're going to be entered into
71-2_2538.05_7.3.wav_ASR	so because the stepmother favors her own daughters she pulls out whatever money they have available
71-2_2545.61_13.82.wav_ASR	and she gets them the the the fanciest dresses that you could possibly choose and you know with hairdressers in to get their hair done and their makeup and everything else to get them as gussied up as possible
71-2_2560.48_2.99.wav_ASR	cinderella pretty much knows that she's on her own
71-2_2563.97_8.22.wav_ASR	so she pulls out a book that she got from her mother which has patterns of dresses
71-2_2572.57_8.51.wav_ASR	and because she's very smart and very creative and because she's had to do a lot of the menial work in the house she knows how to sew
71-2_2581.9_5.18.wav_ASR	so she pulls together some scraps of material that are available to her
71-2_2587.26_3.6.wav_ASR	and she puts together this pretty cool dress really
71-2_2591.12_1.64.wav_ASR	i mean it's kind of off the shoulder
71-2_2593.16_3.109.wav_ASR	and you know it's kind of pink which kind of plays off her hair
71-2_2597.18_1.602.wav_ASR	and she's ready to go
71-2_2599.24_1.68.wav_ASR	she's doing the best that she can
71-2_2600.92_1.16.wav_ASR	that's what she has available
71-2_2602.7_0.86.wav_ASR	and she's ready to go
71-2_2603.98_2.02.wav_ASR	and of course her mother says
71-2_2606.3_1.06.wav_ASR	under no circumstances are you being allowed to go
71-2_2609.46_2.94.wav_ASR	you are not of our status
71-2_2612.88_1.4.wav_ASR	you are of peasantry
71-2_2615.14_2.22.wav_ASR	and you don't have the right clothes for it
71-2_2617.64_1.2.wav_ASR	you aren't dressed correctly
71-2_2619.54_0.74.wav_ASR	you are not gonna go
71-2_2620.5_1.42.wav_ASR	my daughters are going to go
71-2_2622.98_4.02.wav_ASR	and they the stepsisters of course have gotten their cue from their mother
71-2_2627.22_1.94.wav_ASR	and they know to be really really cruel to her
71-2_2629.38_1.02.wav_ASR	so they laugh at her
71-2_2631.4_4.92.wav_ASR	and she goes out in the barn to take care of the animals because that's kind of her refuge
71-2_2636.32_4.32.wav_ASR	that's the place where she can go and get some kind of affection from the other animals
71-2_2641.04_0.764.wav_ASR	and she's out there
71-2_2642.1_1.3.wav_ASR	and you know she's sad
71-2_2644.4_2.137.wav_ASR	and she's wearing her dress and her
71-2_2647.06_1.593.wav_ASR	you know she doesn't know what she's gonna do
71-2_2648.78_0.6.wav_ASR	what does she have
71-2_2649.62_7.806.wav_ASR	what can she possibly do to somehow get out of the miserable situation that she's in
71-2_2657.46_8.42.wav_ASR	and this fairy godmother appears to her because she's you know a wonderful person
71-2_2666.1_1.27.wav_ASR	she's giving to other people
71-2_2667.6_1.24.wav_ASR	and she deserves this
71-2_2669.7_4.22.wav_ASR	so this fairy godmother shows up and said
71-2_2674.82_0.58.wav_ASR	why are you crying
71-2_2675.52_0.52.wav_ASR	what's wrong
71-2_2676.1_0.7.wav_ASR	what do you need
71-2_2677.62_0.66.wav_ASR	and she said
71-2_2678.52_2.04.wav_ASR	i would like to go to the the ball
71-2_2680.9_1.26.wav_ASR	but i want to wear
71-2_2682.56_1.04.wav_ASR	i don't wanna be laughed at
71-2_2683.76_3.48.wav_ASR	i wanna have the appropriate clothes that i i wear
71-2_2687.6_1.84.wav_ASR	i wanna be dressed well like everyone else
71-2_2689.8_7.06.wav_ASR	i want to be have the same opportunities that my stepsisters have
71-2_2697.8_0.58.wav_ASR	so she said
71-2_2699.7_0.6.wav_ASR	alright alright
71-2_2700.72_5.86.wav_ASR	and she you know uses her her magical abilities and said
71-2_2707.42_0.56.wav_ASR	she looks around
71-2_2708.52_7.98.wav_ASR	and she transforms the rats into horses that will be pulling a carriage
71-2_2716.86_3.12.wav_ASR	and the court carriage is transformed from a pumpkin
71-2_2721.2_4.98.wav_ASR	and she uses her wand and and goes over cinderella's clothes
71-2_2726.24_11.79.wav_ASR	and all of a sudden she's wearing these ornate detailed highly expensive beautiful dress
71-2_2738.29_8.18.wav_ASR	her hair is is made up in the the the latest fashion
71-2_2747.67_2.25.wav_ASR	she's got beautiful makeup on
71-2_2750.27_1.14.wav_ASR	she looks gorgeous
71-2_2752.87_4.26.wav_ASR	and her fairy godmother says to her
71-2_2758.27_1.606.wav_ASR	go to the the ball
71-2_2759.97_1.155.wav_ASR	you deserve this
71-2_2761.59_3.96.wav_ASR	but please understand that this illusion will only last till midnight
71-2_2766.17_5.725.wav_ASR	at midnight the horses will be transformed back into rats
71-2_2772.51_4.809.wav_ASR	the carriage will be transformed back into a pumpkin
71-2_2778.35_9.98.wav_ASR	and the fancy ball dress that you're wearing will be transformed back into rags
71-2_2789.37_2.005.wav_ASR	so please go
71-2_2791.95_0.762.wav_ASR	have fun
71-2_2792.712_5.46.wav_ASR	but recognize this is just a moment out of your existence
71-2_2798.512_7.04.wav_ASR	this is a special bubble that that that is hitting your your existence
71-2_2805.892_1.758.wav_ASR	but it's not really gonna change everything
71-2_2808.012_1.558.wav_ASR	but please enjoy your moment
71-2_2810.63_3.14.wav_ASR	so she hugs the fairy godmother
71-2_2814.41_1.88.wav_ASR	she gets in the coach
71-2_2817.21_2.2.wav_ASR	she's taken to the palace
71-2_2820.33_0.36.wav_ASR	she gets out
71-2_2821.17_8.52.wav_ASR	and even her stepsisters don't know who this woman is because she's dressed so magnificently that she stands out
71-2_2830.55_10.16.wav_ASR	all all the other people that are watching can think of is she must be from a really really rich kingdom
71-2_2842.35_1.34.wav_ASR	and we don't know of her
71-2_2843.97_3.16.wav_ASR	but she must be from a very high social status
71-2_2847.65_1.71.wav_ASR	and she's clearly very beautiful
71-2_2849.56_5.5.wav_ASR	i mean the fact that they don't even recognize their own stepsister is pretty telling
71-2_2855.87_1.702.wav_ASR	in any case she walks in
71-2_2858.34_8.7.wav_ASR	the prince immediately in his audition you know format sees her and said
71-2_2867.361_0.856.wav_ASR	she's the stand out
71-2_2868.82_1.51.wav_ASR	she's the one
71-2_2870.72_1.77.wav_ASR	and he heads over to her
71-2_2872.76_1.61.wav_ASR	and he immediately looks at her
71-2_2874.58_5.47.wav_ASR	he sees that she's also beautiful on top of being clearly wealthy and well dressed
71-2_2880.91_1.45.wav_ASR	she's also graceful
71-2_2882.78_0.91.wav_ASR	she's a wonderful dancer
71-2_2884.34_0.31.wav_ASR	they're talking
71-2_2885.36_1.74.wav_ASR	and there's an automatic connection
71-2_2887.88_2.89.wav_ASR	there's there's chemistry between them
71-2_2891.62_0.875.wav_ASR	and he said
71-2_2893.18_1.008.wav_ASR	he's thinking in his mind
71-2_2894.42_1.321.wav_ASR	i thought this was gonna be awful
71-2_2896.04_2.52.wav_ASR	i thought this was going to be a duty
71-2_2898.78_2.795.wav_ASR	but i really like her
71-2_2902.0_1.34.wav_ASR	and i this is
71-2_2903.86_2.26.wav_ASR	i was hoping for something this magical
71-2_2906.281_1.956.wav_ASR	i was prepared for something else
71-2_2908.461_1.931.wav_ASR	but this this could work
71-2_2910.761_2.955.wav_ASR	so he wants to spend time with her as much as he can
71-2_2913.941_0.479.wav_ASR	and all of a sudden
71-2_2914.681_0.98.wav_ASR	and she's into it too
71-2_2915.801_1.52.wav_ASR	i mean they're they're really connecting
71-2_2917.761_1.52.wav_ASR	and it's just this wonderful vibe
71-2_2920.001_4.289.wav_ASR	and then she looks up at the clock and sees that it's five minutes to midnight
71-2_2926.49_28.8.wav_ASR	and she knows because of this patriarchal class structure that she lives in as soon as he sees what she really looks like how she's really dressed that she's really not this wealthy noble princess but is just a a a lower middle class female in his kingdom who's wearing rags
71-2_2956.938_4.418.wav_ASR	she she knows that that illusion will also be gone
71-2_2961.538_9.22.wav_ASR	she she's pretty sure that what he really wanted is the the the trapping the appearances all the stuff that goes along with wealth
71-2_2971.438_5.015.wav_ASR	so she knows this as soon as he sees who she really is it's gonna be over
71-2_2976.453_4.78.wav_ASR	so she races away as quickly as she can because she wants to get away
71-2_2981.093_8.34.wav_ASR	she doesn't wanna see the look in his eye when he sees who she really is and what her real status is and how she's really dressed
71-2_2990.23_2.14.wav_ASR	so he he doesn't understand what happened
71-2_2992.653_0.437.wav_ASR	where is she going
71-2_2993.173_0.717.wav_ASR	what did he say
71-2_2994.053_1.277.wav_ASR	did he say something to offend her
71-2_2995.46_1.51.wav_ASR	where is she heading off
71-2_2997.36_6.02.wav_ASR	and she races away as quickly as she can so quickly that she trips on her shoe
71-2_3003.6_0.62.wav_ASR	she trips
71-2_3004.74_1.712.wav_ASR	and her shoe falls off
71-2_3006.6_1.342.wav_ASR	but she doesn't have time to grab it
71-2_3008.32_0.93.wav_ASR	she's gotta get going
71-2_3009.56_0.89.wav_ASR	she's gotta get away
71-2_3010.96_1.49.wav_ASR	so she makes it around the corner
71-2_3012.45_3.64.wav_ASR	and immediately it happens
71-2_3016.65_9.027.wav_ASR	the the the ball dress is transformed back into her rags
71-2_3025.677_7.746.wav_ASR	the pumpkin luckily she didn't get in it because i don't know what would've happened if she were actually inside the pumpkin
71-2_3033.917_1.461.wav_ASR	it's gone
71-2_3035.637_0.493.wav_ASR	it's a pumpkin
71-2_3036.697_2.343.wav_ASR	and the the horses are gone
71-2_3039.7_1.22.wav_ASR	they're rats again
71-2_3041.9_5.82.wav_ASR	so she walks home sneaks in the back because you know they don't really care what she's doing
71-2_3047.96_2.44.wav_ASR	she could be out in the the barn or whatever
71-2_3051.18_1.98.wav_ASR	and she remembers her moment
71-2_3053.64_0.44.wav_ASR	and she said
71-2_3054.52_2.96.wav_ASR	okay i got to see what it was like to be on the other side of it
71-2_3058.28_1.562.wav_ASR	maybe i can be content
71-2_3059.842_2.694.wav_ASR	or maybe there's some other way that i can get out of here
71-2_3062.542_1.178.wav_ASR	but at least i had that
71-2_3064.362_9.62.wav_ASR	at least i know that if i had the appropriate clothes i could walk into a society at that level and i could succeed
71-2_3075.322_2.431.wav_ASR	in the meantime he's back in the palace
71-2_3078.142_1.402.wav_ASR	he's chasing after her
71-2_3079.8_11.914.wav_ASR	and at this point it's you know kind of the psychology of of what's going on in his brain is that all these women are throwing themselves at him that all of a sudden this one is playing hard to get because she left
71-2_3092.42_1.26.wav_ASR	so there's kind of a mystery there
71-2_3093.8_0.92.wav_ASR	but he's got the shoe
71-2_3095.48_0.44.wav_ASR	and he said
71-2_3096.62_2.419.wav_ASR	okay i want that woman
71-2_3099.039_1.554.wav_ASR	and he says that to his father
71-2_3101.459_0.874.wav_ASR	i will get married
71-2_3102.659_1.457.wav_ASR	i'll do everything you want me to do
71-2_3104.319_1.26.wav_ASR	i'll fulfill my obligations
71-2_3106.019_2.317.wav_ASR	but i'm only gonna marry a woman i wanna be with
71-2_3108.479_1.188.wav_ASR	and i've decided who it is
71-2_3109.899_0.481.wav_ASR	it's her
71-2_3110.579_0.492.wav_ASR	the princess
71-2_3111.559_1.82.wav_ASR	the mystery woman
71-2_3113.739_1.359.wav_ASR	and i've got her shoe
71-2_3115.098_9.104.wav_ASR	so all i have to do now is go around and see if i can figure out whose foot will fit into that shoe
71-2_3124.478_2.226.wav_ASR	and then that will be the person
71-2_3126.704_14.559.wav_ASR	because he's beginning to understand in his mind that there are some limitations of this society which is that there are human beings that transcend their social status and how much money they make
71-2_3141.263_17.44.wav_ASR	and he's beginning to think if they could just be soul soulmates that it could exist regardless of what their initial position in society was
71-2_3158.75_4.86.wav_ASR	so at this point he's thinking much more broadly than his father is
71-2_3163.91_2.82.wav_ASR	and so they've got this this this bargain
71-2_3167.87_7.62.wav_ASR	if he can find a woman whose feet fit into those glass slippers he will know who that person is
71-2_3175.61_0.918.wav_ASR	and then he'll look at her
71-2_3176.528_4.36.wav_ASR	and he'll be able to know that that's the person that is his true soulmate
71-2_3181.928_1.599.wav_ASR	and that's the person that he will win
71-2_3184.23_8.169.wav_ASR	and because the way society works is if you're rich you can marry down but but it has to be their choice
71-2_3192.59_7.512.wav_ASR	if you're poor and you wanna marry up you're gonna be viewed as some kind of social climber
71-2_3200.21_5.812.wav_ASR	so you pretty much need someone rich to reach down in some way
71-2_3207.09_0.38.wav_ASR	so
71-2_3208.27_0.924.wav_ASR	plus he's male
71-2_3209.37_0.56.wav_ASR	and she's female
71-2_3210.23_5.02.wav_ASR	and given the patriarchal limits of them she doesn't get to ask him
71-2_3215.67_1.58.wav_ASR	he has to ask her
71-2_3217.53_2.64.wav_ASR	again this goes back two hundred years
71-2_3220.23_10.62.wav_ASR	and this is the way in which europe organized their society to their deficit in terms of what people could actually do potentially
71-2_3232.95_1.66.wav_ASR	so he's going around
71-2_3234.63_9.058.wav_ASR	and of course this is clearly a really inefficient way to find the partner that he's actually looking for the mystery woman who got away
71-2_3244.37_1.53.wav_ASR	but he doesn't know else what to do
71-2_3246.27_1.395.wav_ASR	i mean he's advertised that
71-2_3248.05_0.952.wav_ASR	she's the one i want
71-2_3249.19_4.215.wav_ASR	who saw the woman you know with the the great carriage
71-2_3253.405_1.7.wav_ASR	and he's called his detectives
71-2_3255.445_1.264.wav_ASR	and everybody's looking for her
71-2_3256.825_0.684.wav_ASR	and they can't find her
71-2_3258.025_3.705.wav_ASR	so we're gonna start with the the shoe because he's got something in front of him
71-2_3262.625_10.345.wav_ASR	and they advertise that he will be going city to city to city seeing if women would come forward to see if he can find the woman that will fit the shoe
71-2_3273.59_2.54.wav_ASR	so of course the stepdaughters said
71-2_3276.77_4.492.wav_ASR	okay he passed us by the night of the ball
71-2_3281.67_5.34.wav_ASR	but all we gotta do at this point is get our feet to fit into that shoe
71-2_3287.15_7.66.wav_ASR	and of course they're looking at this in a really superficial kind of way because he knows that as soon as he finds the right woman their souls will connect again
71-2_3298.01_6.16.wav_ASR	and clearly even if those shoes did fit the stepdaughters it wouldn't matter
71-2_3304.47_1.08.wav_ASR	there'd be no magic
71-2_3305.92_1.24.wav_ASR	there'd be no chemistry
71-2_3307.5_1.43.wav_ASR	but you know they don't understand that
71-2_3309.14_4.5.wav_ASR	they're really behind in terms of understanding human relationships
71-2_3314.91_9.46.wav_ASR	cinderella is she knows if she has the opportunity to connect with him again he can take her out of the situation that she's in
71-2_3324.63_1.94.wav_ASR	and they did connect
71-2_3326.99_0.66.wav_ASR	they shouldn't have
71-2_3327.87_0.666.wav_ASR	but they did
71-2_3328.77_1.6.wav_ASR	it was very improbable
71-2_3331.15_16.88.wav_ASR	but for whatever reason because of the fairy godmother she's she's been given that opportunity to step out of her role and move into a the princess level
71-2_3349.85_4.94.wav_ASR	so when they come up to the house both of the stepdaughters go out
71-2_3355.33_3.9.wav_ASR	and they try very hard to see if their feet will fit into the shoes
71-2_3359.65_1.118.wav_ASR	and they they don't
71-2_3361.07_2.251.wav_ASR	they're doing everything that they can
71-2_3363.39_2.46.wav_ASR	and at this point the prince is just very discouraged
71-2_3366.67_1.663.wav_ASR	he doesn't think he's ever gonna find her again
71-2_3368.45_4.78.wav_ASR	and he'll be stuck with somebody else that his father will probably arrange for him
71-2_3374.21_1.02.wav_ASR	and he finally said
71-2_3375.45_9.07.wav_ASR	is there any other women in this house who could possibly be eligible for this
71-2_3385.34_2.26.wav_ASR	and cinderella steps forward
71-2_3388.1_5.46.wav_ASR	and this is the bravest thing she's ever done because her stepmother is just gonna punish her for this afterwards
71-2_3394.22_0.66.wav_ASR	and she said
71-2_3395.354_0.61.wav_ASR	i'm here
71-2_3396.64_1.68.wav_ASR	and the stepmother turns and looks at her
71-2_3398.32_11.3.wav_ASR	and she's ready to you know clearly to punish her and and banish her out to the barn prevent her not to eat for a while and really really make her life miserable
71-2_3410.66_4.26.wav_ASR	but the person that's working with the prince said
71-2_3415.8_1.04.wav_ASR	okay he said everybody
71-2_3417.006_1.52.wav_ASR	come on out
71-2_3419.206_5.75.wav_ASR	and she steps forward despite the fact that she's being glared at by the family members
71-2_3426.49_1.26.wav_ASR	and she sits down
71-2_3428.266_4.56.wav_ASR	and her foot fits the shoe perfectly
71-2_3433.786_1.224.wav_ASR	the prince looks at her
71-2_3435.486_0.884.wav_ASR	their eyes meet
71-2_3437.19_5.92.wav_ASR	and once again he knows he's he's met his soulmate
71-2_3444.51_11.84.wav_ASR	and at that point all of the power that the prince has to be able to protect her from her stepmother is kind of enforced
71-2_3457.31_6.494.wav_ASR	all of her beautiful clothes come back though we're beginning to think this might have been an illusion in the first place
71-2_3465.03_1.22.wav_ASR	the stepmother said
71-2_3467.17_0.966.wav_ASR	she's outta my hands
71-2_3468.27_3.048.wav_ASR	i have no ability to punish her anymore
71-2_3471.91_15.74.wav_ASR	and the prince pulls her out of there and brings her back to the palace where she will be groomed to be a much higher status than she has been living
71-2_3488.11_2.18.wav_ASR	i mean she's gonna hafta learn how to have manners
71-2_3490.38_2.51.wav_ASR	she's gonna hafta learn how to talk better
71-2_3493.22_6.463.wav_ASR	she's gonna hafta learn how to conduct herself as a lady
71-2_3500.06_5.22.wav_ASR	all the things that are associate associated with a higher social class
71-2_3505.28_7.11.wav_ASR	but because they connect at a human level this is gonna work
71-2_3569.68_4.16.wav_ASR	i was just thinking about telling you about the one i told you last week
71-2_3574.16_1.744.wav_ASR	so i have to come up with a new one in that
71-2_3575.904_16.746.wav_ASR	when i was in the third grade which means i was about eight i was very good with being able to read a clock
71-2_3594.17_4.66.wav_ASR	but there were some details that i was not completely clear about
71-2_3599.49_5.1.wav_ASR	and one of those is what is a quarter after on a clock
71-2_3606.01_7.8.wav_ASR	i mean i certainly knew that the shorter hand was the hour
71-2_3614.27_3.18.wav_ASR	and the long handle was the minute
71-2_3618.41_10.9.wav_ASR	but from my perspective in my eight year old brain when someone said quarter afterq it meant twenty five afterq
71-2_3629.95_0.94.wav_ASR	it didn't mean fifteen minutes afterq
71-2_3632.237_7.116.wav_ASR	and what had happened is my older sister was had stayed home sick that day
71-2_3640.43_4.54.wav_ASR	and i was supposta go to her elementary school teacher
71-2_3645.277_2.053.wav_ASR	she was in the fifth grade
71-2_3647.95_6.86.wav_ASR	and i was supposed to get her home homework and bring it home to her so that she could do her work and she could return it the next day
71-2_3655.69_1.8.wav_ASR	and so i went to my teacher and said
71-2_3657.81_4.4.wav_ASR	i'm supposed to go to mrs lastnamef class
71-2_3662.55_3.64.wav_ASR	and i'm supposed to pick up my sister's homework
71-2_3667.09_0.66.wav_ASR	and she said
71-2_3668.13_1.372.wav_ASR	why don't you go at quarter after
71-2_3669.502_1.648.wav_ASR	so i said
71-2_3671.37_0.632.wav_ASR	okay i will
71-2_3672.79_7.687.wav_ASR	i thought quarter afterq was twenty five minutes after because in my mind that's what made sense
71-2_3680.63_1.36.wav_ASR	a quarter is twenty five minutes
71-2_3682.55_2.16.wav_ASR	it's a quarter is worth twenty five cents
71-2_3685.29_6.464.wav_ASR	so quarter afterq would be three twenty five not three fifteen which is what she's saying
71-2_3691.83_1.241.wav_ASR	a quarter after the hour
71-2_3693.83_6.8.wav_ASR	so i waited till three twenty five which is five minutes before the school is is closing
71-2_3701.57_3.218.wav_ASR	it's way too late for me to be going and doing what i'm supposed to be doing
71-2_3704.71_1.76.wav_ASR	i was supposta have done it ten minutes earlier
71-2_3706.77_5.92.wav_ASR	but i'm watching the clock til it's exactly three twenty five and getting up and going to doing what i'm supposta do
71-2_3713.17_1.54.wav_ASR	and i ran over there
71-2_3715.13_4.3.wav_ASR	and of course it's a mess because i'm missing the end of my class
71-2_3720.41_4.7.wav_ASR	mrs lastnamef's class is closing down
71-2_3726.15_4.02.wav_ASR	and so i get back to my class probably at three thirty five
71-2_3730.99_3.236.wav_ASR	my teacher is still waiting there because my stuff is still in the desk
71-2_3734.91_1.24.wav_ASR	why did you wait so long
71-2_3736.33_0.6.wav_ASR	and i said
71-2_3737.07_2.17.wav_ASR	i went exactly when you told me to go
71-2_3739.78_1.66.wav_ASR	you told me to go at quarter after
71-2_3742.38_0.58.wav_ASR	and she said
71-2_3743.24_2.52.wav_ASR	no no you didn't go till three twenty five
71-2_3746.02_0.42.wav_ASR	and i said
71-2_3746.78_1.46.wav_ASR	but isn't that quarter after
71-2_3749.18_19.93.wav_ASR	and so at the age of eight i understood finally that when adults say quarter afterq and they're gesturing or referring to a clock that they mean fifteen minutes after an hour and not twenty five minutes after an hour
71-2_3769.95_0.381.wav_ASR	how's that
71-2_3770.47_0.576.wav_ASR	i don't know
71-2_3783.83_0.927.wav_ASR	yeah well to me
71-2_3784.77_0.667.wav_ASR	i was eight
71-2_3785.65_0.876.wav_ASR	it still makes sense
71-2_3786.87_2.118.wav_ASR	they should've said you know quarter after the hour
71-2_3788.988_1.9.wav_ASR	quarter after sixty minutes
71-2_3791.248_1.687.wav_ASR	they just weren't clear about it
71-2_3793.668_2.282.wav_ASR	not that i actually talked back to
71-2_3796.328_1.262.wav_ASR	i mean i was in catholic school
71-2_3797.748_1.362.wav_ASR	you never talked back to anybody
71-2_3799.368_1.8.wav_ASR	but i still i was just really confused
71-2_3809.35_6.62.wav_ASR	let me think of a good bird
71-2_3816.149_18.351.wav_ASR	to talk about this story i think i'm going to talk about when i learned how to roast a turkey because at the time when i did it i was asked if i could bake the bird
71-2_3836.08_11.38.wav_ASR	and of course growing up in an extended family in which we had very very huge thanksgivings i never made my own thanksgiving dinner by myself
71-2_3847.78_2.32.wav_ASR	i generally we would go to my grandmother's house
71-2_3850.98_1.12.wav_ASR	and she had eleven children
71-2_3852.94_2.427.wav_ASR	so our job
71-2_3855.367_3.059.wav_ASR	my father was the second oldest of that family
71-2_3859.04_2.22.wav_ASR	our job was to bring some pies
71-2_3861.92_7.327.wav_ASR	and usually we would bring something else whether it would be cranberry or something else bread something
71-2_3869.707_2.393.wav_ASR	but we never made the turkey
71-2_3872.607_2.173.wav_ASR	we were never responsible for doing any of that
71-2_3874.78_1.654.wav_ASR	and we'd show up
71-2_3876.434_0.914.wav_ASR	and there'd be plenty of food
71-2_3877.82_5.48.wav_ASR	and you know i'd hang out in the kitchen with the women because they were kind of restricted that way
71-2_3883.46_1.96.wav_ASR	and the men would be in the living room watching football
71-2_3886.28_4.902.wav_ASR	and yeah you would just try to deal with those gender roles
71-2_3891.42_2.44.wav_ASR	but in any case i was by myself
71-2_3893.937_6.46.wav_ASR	i think i was a senior in college
71-2_3903.017_2.6.wav_ASR	and i was working as a waitress
71-2_3906.217_1.753.wav_ASR	and i didn't have a car
71-2_3909.03_2.46.wav_ASR	and i couldn't get enough time off from work
71-2_3911.917_1.736.wav_ASR	i didn't have enough seniority there
71-2_3913.653_4.9.wav_ASR	so for whatever reason i hadta work on wednesday before thanksgiving
71-2_3919.253_1.48.wav_ASR	and i was gonna be deprived
71-2_3920.873_2.933.wav_ASR	i was gonna miss this big family event
71-2_3924.413_4.96.wav_ASR	but i decided that i was still going to make sure that i had the trappings
71-2_3929.773_1.74.wav_ASR	that i still had turkey
71-2_3931.715_1.84.wav_ASR	that i still had pie
71-2_3934.135_1.48.wav_ASR	that i still had dressing
71-2_3935.995_1.437.wav_ASR	i mean those are the things i liked anyway
71-2_3937.995_2.438.wav_ASR	so i was gonna go through this because now i'm an adult right
71-2_3940.455_1.144.wav_ASR	and i know how to do all this
71-2_3941.995_1.475.wav_ASR	and why shouldn't i be able to do it
71-2_3943.535_0.973.wav_ASR	it can't be hard
71-2_3945.135_1.145.wav_ASR	it comes out of the oven
71-2_3946.495_1.92.wav_ASR	it looks like you turn the oven on
71-2_3948.615_1.065.wav_ASR	you put the turkey in
71-2_3949.895_1.065.wav_ASR	you leave it in for a long time
71-2_3951.06_1.38.wav_ASR	and eventually you pull it out
71-2_3952.98_1.427.wav_ASR	and then you you eat it right
71-2_3954.407_0.765.wav_ASR	i can do that
71-2_3956.5_5.3.wav_ASR	so the tuesday before thanksgiving after i'm calling
71-2_3962.12_0.88.wav_ASR	and everyone's saying
71-2_3963.12_1.013.wav_ASR	you're not gonna be here
71-2_3964.3_1.612.wav_ASR	i can't believe you're not gonna be here
71-2_3965.912_1.841.wav_ASR	and i'm feeling all deprived and all this
71-2_3967.94_2.64.wav_ASR	but i pick up this turkey
71-2_3970.948_2.557.wav_ASR	and i don't get a particularly big one
71-2_3973.708_0.995.wav_ASR	but it's pretty big
71-2_3974.748_3.832.wav_ASR	it's probably like twenty pounds which is certainly more than i need
71-2_3979.388_1.599.wav_ASR	but you know i don't know
71-2_3981.128_5.18.wav_ASR	it's smaller than the ones that my family has ever used for thanksgiving
71-2_3986.648_1.44.wav_ASR	so i pick up this turkey
71-2_3989.32_4.94.wav_ASR	after i get home from work on wednesday i pull it out of the freezer
71-2_3994.86_1.6.wav_ASR	and you kinda see where i'm going here with this
71-2_3997.14_1.16.wav_ASR	i pull it out of the freezer
71-2_3998.92_0.655.wav_ASR	and say
71-2_3999.94_8.707.wav_ASR	okay i think i probably if i put it in in the morning on thursday morning i should be able to eat probably like four o'clock in the afternoon
71-2_4008.6_3.427.wav_ASR	and you know i already knew how to make pies and all the other stuff
71-2_4012.36_2.28.wav_ASR	so i stick it in the oven
71-2_4015.16_2.54.wav_ASR	i put tinfoil over it
71-2_4018.12_1.74.wav_ASR	i've got the temperature correct
71-2_4020.98_0.76.wav_ASR	i put it in
71-2_4022.48_2.3.wav_ASR	and you know in the meantime i'm getting really hungry
71-2_4025.22_1.08.wav_ASR	it's you know the day is going on
71-2_4026.96_2.58.wav_ASR	the oven smells really good
71-2_4030.16_1.799.wav_ASR	i've already got the pies that are
71-2_4032.82_2.322.wav_ASR	actually i bought the pies because i didn't have time to bake them
71-2_4035.7_1.44.wav_ASR	and i got out this other food
71-2_4037.36_0.82.wav_ASR	and i'm watching tv
71-2_4038.6_1.326.wav_ASR	and so it's about four o'clock
71-2_4040.14_5.623.wav_ASR	and i invited my next door neighbor to come over and help thanksgiving with me share it with me
71-2_4045.6_2.7.wav_ASR	and i pull out the oven
71-2_4048.88_8.18.wav_ASR	i open the oven door pull out the the turkey and take off the tin foil
71-2_4058.22_5.156.wav_ASR	and all of a sudden i notice is it's still kind of raw on the top
71-2_4063.76_1.56.wav_ASR	and it's
71-2_4065.473_3.02.wav_ASR	and i didn't understand you had to thaw them
71-2_4068.773_3.506.wav_ASR	i i didn't know that there's actually a process yeah that goes into this
71-2_4072.673_10.555.wav_ASR	so what i have is a turkey which is overcooked on the bottom completely no uncooked on the top part of it
71-2_4083.413_1.1.wav_ASR	there's blood everywhere
71-2_4084.791_4.6.wav_ASR	no or you know at least you know when you wiggle it you're supposed to have clear juices
71-2_4089.731_1.877.wav_ASR	well i'm having blood coming out of it no
71-2_4092.3_1.672.wav_ASR	so i've got my next door neighbor saying
71-2_4094.631_1.127.wav_ASR	so when are we gonna eat
71-2_4095.771_0.429.wav_ASR	and i said
71-2_4096.271_1.769.wav_ASR	well it looks like it's not done yet
71-2_4098.231_1.569.wav_ASR	i don't know why it's taking this long
71-2_4101.011_1.629.wav_ASR	and i said
71-2_4103.091_0.989.wav_ASR	well let's just eat the pie
71-2_4104.66_1.34.wav_ASR	so i put it back in the oven
71-2_4106.3_0.82.wav_ASR	we eat the pie
71-2_4107.6_2.94.wav_ASR	we start eating you know whatever i've got in the house
71-2_4110.92_3.32.wav_ASR	and i keep opening the oven door and checking it
71-2_4114.46_1.1.wav_ASR	and it's still not done
71-2_4115.9_3.62.wav_ASR	no and finally at this point my my neighbor said
71-2_4119.66_2.687.wav_ASR	you know i'm not really hungry anymore because we'd been eating
71-2_4122.347_5.32.wav_ASR	i think i had some macaroni and cheese in the refrigerator
71-2_4127.947_0.653.wav_ASR	and we'd eaten that
71-2_4128.987_0.853.wav_ASR	we'd already had the pie
71-2_4130.887_1.513.wav_ASR	you know we're eating other stuff
71-2_4132.587_2.053.wav_ASR	i think we're drinking beer pretty much at that point
71-2_4135.127_1.673.wav_ASR	and it still just wasn't done
71-2_4136.987_0.32.wav_ASR	so i said
71-2_4137.427_1.789.wav_ASR	i think there's something wrong with my oven
71-2_4139.216_4.64.wav_ASR	for whatever reason this bird did not cook
71-2_4144.716_6.64.wav_ASR	so basically i finally took it out of the oven stuck it back in the refrigerator
71-2_4152.1_1.576.wav_ASR	it was half cooked
71-2_4154.1_6.54.wav_ASR	and then i found out the next day from my aunt that it was supposta have been thawed probably three or four days in advance
71-2_4161.66_3.14.wav_ASR	that's that's the only way that it's cooked evenly
71-2_4164.8_10.968.wav_ASR	and i never told anybody other than my aunt that the reason that my turkey did not work out is not because i forgot to thaw it
71-2_4175.98_2.66.wav_ASR	but because i told her the oven just didn't work
71-2_4178.98_0.94.wav_ASR	and that's the family
71-2_4180.26_1.499.wav_ASR	so that's the one i went with right
71-2_4181.86_0.46.wav_ASR	i did not
71-2_4182.62_1.64.wav_ASR	they would've laughed at me forever
71-2_4184.269_5.704.wav_ASR	they'd have ridiculed me for decades for not knowing something as basic as that
71-2_4190.749_3.091.wav_ASR	but it's the first bird i ever tried to bake
71-2_4194.709_2.56.wav_ASR	and there's there's they need to tell you the details
71-2_4197.749_2.931.wav_ASR	i mean there's more involved than just stick it in the oven
71-2_4201.309_1.4.wav_ASR	so anyway yeah
71-2_4202.869_1.276.wav_ASR	by the way i didn't even tell you
71-2_4204.145_0.66.wav_ASR	i didn't take
71-2_4205.385_11.22.wav_ASR	the neck was actually inside paper and was stuck inside no the turkey which i didn't even know because it was too frozen solid
71-2_4217.465_4.355.wav_ASR	so when i finally was able to get it out i had paper in there too on top of it
71-2_4222.245_1.467.wav_ASR	my so kind of a mess
71-2_4223.712_2.033.wav_ASR	eventually i ate it
71-2_4225.772_5.36.wav_ASR	i i just hacked it up and kind of cooked it in sections
71-2_4231.613_1.392.wav_ASR	but i did use it all
71-2_4244.36_0.39.wav_ASR	let me see
71-2_4246.12_3.22.wav_ASR	oh okay
71-2_4250.31_12.91.wav_ASR	i'm going to talk about a hotel that i stayed in when i was living in copenhagen and was traveling with five other people
71-2_4263.273_6.26.wav_ASR	now in this particular case what had happened is we were on christmas break
71-2_4270.133_3.68.wav_ASR	so we had a month off in which there were no classes
71-2_4274.793_1.429.wav_ASR	and so all of us
71-2_4276.413_2.08.wav_ASR	there were about twenty five of us there
71-2_4278.663_5.439.wav_ASR	we were between the ages of nineteen and twenty one and were in europe
71-2_4284.483_8.28.wav_ASR	and we have the ability to be able to buy eurail passes which means unlimited travel
71-2_4293.323_0.72.wav_ASR	you're basically
71-2_4294.543_3.437.wav_ASR	i i can't remember what it cost at this point
71-2_4297.98_2.54.wav_ASR	but i think it was about a hundred dollars you paid
71-2_4300.82_16.44.wav_ASR	and you could essentially go anywhere anywhere as far south as greece and as far north as finland as long as it was on this this railway
71-2_4317.626_3.34.wav_ASR	so you know we had all these ways of trying to do it cheaper
71-2_4321.286_2.024.wav_ASR	you know we'd sleep on on trains
71-2_4323.546_4.404.wav_ASR	we would take things at night so that we wouldn't have to worry about a a hotel
71-2_4328.866_1.9.wav_ASR	but we were now
71-2_4331.086_2.44.wav_ASR	there were several of us that were traveling
71-2_4333.686_1.58.wav_ASR	i was with a friend called firstnameka
71-2_4335.298_4.36.wav_ASR	and we were connecting in with firstnames and firstnamek
71-2_4339.721_2.975.wav_ASR	and they were coming
71-2_4342.838_1.313.wav_ASR	they had traveled from somewhere else
71-2_4344.198_2.045.wav_ASR	but we're all gonna meet together in rome
71-2_4346.718_4.949.wav_ASR	and we figured we would all stay in a hotel together to save money you know
71-2_4351.738_2.52.wav_ASR	we would have i think two beds
71-2_4354.57_1.472.wav_ASR	so there was firstnamek
71-2_4356.47_1.518.wav_ASR	and one of us would sleep with firstnamek
71-2_4357.988_3.735.wav_ASR	and then two women would be in the other bed
71-2_4362.65_1.8.wav_ASR	so it's new year's eve right
71-2_4364.61_1.672.wav_ASR	because this is christmas break
71-2_4366.73_2.06.wav_ASR	we arrive in rome
71-2_4369.51_2.46.wav_ASR	and the first thing we we would do when
71-2_4372.105_3.44.wav_ASR	and we were gonna meet with each other at the train station
71-2_4376.45_1.74.wav_ASR	we all met at the train station
71-2_4378.485_2.025.wav_ASR	we all got in within half an hour of each other
71-2_4380.725_0.585.wav_ASR	we connected
71-2_4381.31_17.334.wav_ASR	and the first thing we would always do is go to the the information center in the train station and get the maps and find out what's going on in the city and where the cheap hotels are and you know basically what we're gonna be doing
71-2_4399.31_1.66.wav_ASR	well there's a guy there working there
71-2_4400.97_1.48.wav_ASR	and he was about twenty
71-2_4402.65_5.436.wav_ASR	very attractive italian man who said
71-2_4408.77_2.324.wav_ASR	he was just started flirting with us too
71-2_4410.93_1.58.wav_ASR	so there are three american women
71-2_4412.97_0.805.wav_ASR	there's this one guy
71-2_4414.09_1.187.wav_ASR	and he's traveling with us
71-2_4415.73_2.32.wav_ASR	and he just said
71-2_4418.51_1.44.wav_ASR	so you're gonna be in rome
71-2_4420.19_0.352.wav_ASR	we said
71-2_4420.542_1.785.wav_ASR	yeah we're gonna be here in a couple of days
71-2_4423.022_0.528.wav_ASR	what are your plans
71-2_4423.642_1.191.wav_ASR	well we don't have plans
71-2_4425.142_0.92.wav_ASR	we're just traveling
71-2_4426.362_1.68.wav_ASR	and we're open to any experiences
71-2_4428.462_0.4.wav_ASR	and he said
71-2_4428.922_1.677.wav_ASR	well we're gonna be having a party tonight
71-2_4431.182_1.62.wav_ASR	would you like to come to our party my gosh
71-2_4433.777_1.345.wav_ASR	and of course you know
71-2_4435.601_1.401.wav_ASR	of course we'll come to your parties
71-2_4437.262_1.273.wav_ASR	we don't know anybody here
71-2_4438.722_1.324.wav_ASR	of course we'll come to your parties
71-2_4440.046_0.685.wav_ASR	it's new year's eve
71-2_4440.731_1.855.wav_ASR	we'd love to go to an italian party
71-2_4442.966_1.106.wav_ASR	and yeah they
71-2_4444.486_4.06.wav_ASR	i've seen the movie taken which means it could have gone very differently
71-2_4448.786_0.842.wav_ASR	but that's not what happened here
71-2_4450.606_1.32.wav_ASR	so we get to our hotel
71-2_4453.086_0.895.wav_ASR	and we check in
71-2_4454.966_4.62.wav_ASR	and the guy behind the desk looked at all of us and said
71-2_4459.59_1.88.wav_ASR	you all wanna be in one room together
71-2_4462.21_0.62.wav_ASR	and we said
71-2_4463.448_1.886.wav_ASR	we want one room two beds
71-2_4466.53_1.558.wav_ASR	and he looked at firstnamek
71-2_4468.088_2.082.wav_ASR	and he pulled him aside and said
71-2_4470.79_1.3.wav_ASR	you must not be italian
71-2_4472.41_4.094.wav_ASR	if i were in that room i would not be able to sleep the entire night
71-2_4476.504_3.19.wav_ASR	the entire night with all of these beautiful women around
71-2_4480.57_2.338.wav_ASR	and firstnamek he hadn't come out yet
71-2_4482.944_3.806.wav_ASR	but about a year later after that when we all had a reunion he said
71-2_4487.104_0.926.wav_ASR	you know i'm i'm gay
71-2_4488.81_0.614.wav_ASR	and we said
71-2_4489.544_1.514.wav_ASR	no we we didn't know that
71-2_4491.584_4.638.wav_ASR	but then i was thinking at the time you know he he actually didn't know he was gay
71-2_4496.25_7.099.wav_ASR	but he said one of the things that made clear to him that he was gay is when that italian man had said
71-2_4504.19_3.358.wav_ASR	i wouldn't be able to sleep if i were in the room with these beautiful women
71-2_4508.07_0.96.wav_ASR	and he was thinking
71-2_4509.29_1.838.wav_ASR	you know i'm not interested in any of them
71-2_4511.51_1.94.wav_ASR	he eventually thought
71-2_4513.97_1.867.wav_ASR	well maybe there's a reason for that
71-2_4515.85_1.695.wav_ASR	so but in any case
71-2_4518.19_2.637.wav_ASR	so we we i actually slept with firstnamek
71-2_4520.91_0.704.wav_ASR	that was
71-2_4523.37_1.48.wav_ASR	i mean there was no
71-2_4525.51_3.045.wav_ASR	really it didn't matter i mean who we were gonna sleep with
71-2_4528.59_1.436.wav_ASR	he was like my brother at that point
71-2_4530.79_1.74.wav_ASR	so firstnamek and i slept in one bed
71-2_4532.73_0.64.wav_ASR	and it was a double
71-2_4533.83_2.42.wav_ASR	and firstnames and firstnameka slept in the other one
71-2_4536.43_6.242.wav_ASR	and we put all our stuff up you know our backpacks and our sleeping bags
71-2_4542.95_1.454.wav_ASR	and then we all went to this party
71-2_4544.65_2.441.wav_ASR	and everybody's really well dressed at this party
71-2_4547.69_2.18.wav_ASR	i mean we're jeans sweaters
71-2_4558.543_1.81.wav_ASR	and everybody's all made up
71-2_4560.543_2.446.wav_ASR	and there we are look looking like we look
71-2_4563.963_5.82.wav_ASR	and the whole thing at the party became the focus of
71-2_4569.795_5.22.wav_ASR	so this guy is sleeping with all three of you in the hotel
71-2_4575.455_8.129.wav_ASR	and that's all we talked about all night long was just that firstnamek had three different women that he was having sex with
71-2_4583.835_2.445.wav_ASR	and so my god you know they all kept saying
71-2_4586.535_3.105.wav_ASR	i wish i could be an american man and travel with three women
71-2_4589.64_1.073.wav_ASR	and you know and
71-2_4591.62_1.186.wav_ASR	and poor firstnamek was so embarrassed
71-2_4593.08_2.472.wav_ASR	he was just so embarrassed by the whole thing
71-2_4595.68_0.879.wav_ASR	and we
71-2_4597.78_4.75.wav_ASR	well what's interesting is on the way back we stopped again in the the bathroom
71-2_4602.76_3.63.wav_ASR	and firstnamek came out of the men's bathroom and said
71-2_4607.06_1.72.wav_ASR	i just had the strangest encounter
71-2_4609.0_0.74.wav_ASR	and we go
71-2_4609.96_0.5.wav_ASR	what happened
71-2_4610.475_1.125.wav_ASR	he said
71-2_4611.66_1.84.wav_ASR	well i was at the urinal
71-2_4614.02_1.751.wav_ASR	and i was standing there
71-2_4615.94_0.733.wav_ASR	and i was peeing
71-2_4617.72_1.59.wav_ASR	and all of a sudden this man came in
71-2_4619.54_4.24.wav_ASR	and he could have gone to the other side of the row of urinals
71-2_4624.08_1.411.wav_ASR	but he came and stood right next to me
71-2_4626.74_0.6.wav_ASR	and he said
71-2_4627.405_1.298.wav_ASR	and i don't know what that means
71-2_4628.703_0.68.wav_ASR	and i said
71-2_4630.703_0.392.wav_ASR	i don't know
71-2_4631.095_1.208.wav_ASR	maybe it's italian you know
71-2_4632.523_0.44.wav_ASR	and he said
71-2_4633.223_4.051.wav_ASR	and you know he had the biggest penis i'd ever seen
71-2_4637.563_0.429.wav_ASR	and i my god
71-2_4638.163_1.275.wav_ASR	so somehow that
71-2_4640.283_2.322.wav_ASR	thinking about that a year later it kind of made sense
71-2_4642.723_0.997.wav_ASR	but at the time i kept saying
71-2_4643.84_0.556.wav_ASR	i don't know
71-2_4644.543_1.18.wav_ASR	maybe that's just what italian
71-2_4645.732_10.149.wav_ASR	we just thought italian men were so strange that some how they would not be able to sleep in a a a fully clothed woman and not be able to sleep when he is exhausted because
71-2_4656.872_1.771.wav_ASR	i could not sleep if i were in that room
71-2_4658.952_2.411.wav_ASR	i just couldn't imagine all those women around him
71-2_4661.432_1.043.wav_ASR	we were sharing a bathroom
71-2_4663.072_0.5.wav_ASR	oh my god
71-2_4663.885_1.9.wav_ASR	so anyway yeah
71-2_4665.989_3.342.wav_ASR	that's my goodness better than the one where i had to say
71-2_4669.685_0.92.wav_ASR	do you have any vaccinations
71-2_4670.828_2.306.wav_ASR	which is what i gave you last week
71-2_4673.345_2.38.wav_ASR	but i don't have a lot of hotel stories
71-2_4676.085_0.796.wav_ASR	but yeah anyway
71-2_4677.505_0.76.wav_ASR	that was one
71-2_4683.67_0.73.wav_ASR	okay alright
71-2_4684.79_1.88.wav_ASR	well we've already talked about my occupation
71-2_4687.29_1.19.wav_ASR	so i'll come up with a different one
71-2_4688.98_22.04.wav_ASR	i useta have this thing that i would do to family members and friends which involved embarrassing them in restaurants on birthdays their birthdays in in particular
71-2_4711.28_5.98.wav_ASR	and what i would do is i would usually go quietly
71-2_4718.12_0.593.wav_ASR	i would get up
71-2_4718.88_1.542.wav_ASR	i would excuse myself from the table
71-2_4720.7_0.485.wav_ASR	and i would go
71-2_4721.32_1.92.wav_ASR	and i would talk to the the waitresses
71-2_4723.38_1.18.wav_ASR	and i would say something like
71-2_4724.78_0.758.wav_ASR	this is my cousin
71-2_4725.64_1.14.wav_ASR	it's his birthday today
71-2_4727.48_2.1.wav_ASR	he doesn't like any attention
71-2_4729.698_4.925.wav_ASR	so is there any point in time in which you could bring us a cake
71-2_4734.623_3.695.wav_ASR	and then we could really embarrass him by singing really loudly all around
71-2_4738.31_3.62.wav_ASR	usually the waitress staff they're always like
71-2_4742.318_0.971.wav_ASR	yeah we'd love to do that
71-2_4743.298_0.762.wav_ASR	that would be fun
71-2_4744.738_1.792.wav_ASR	so i had this thing about doing that
71-2_4746.63_5.9.wav_ASR	and very often i would bring my own candles the kind that don't blow off
71-2_4752.99_5.848.wav_ASR	that yeah when you blow them they they relight because then you can really really embarrass people
71-2_4758.97_1.497.wav_ASR	and that was my plan
71-2_4761.43_2.915.wav_ASR	so it was my cousin's birthday
71-2_4764.86_4.14.wav_ASR	and his relationship with his girlfriend just ended
71-2_4769.48_3.76.wav_ASR	and he's always kind of quiet and and shy
71-2_4774.06_7.648.wav_ASR	so i decided that what we should really do is we should call a lot of attention to him because this would be good for him
71-2_4782.483_4.66.wav_ASR	so there were about fifteen of us there in the family
71-2_4787.403_2.28.wav_ASR	we weren't all sitting in the same table
71-2_4790.743_1.267.wav_ASR	we weren't in the same booth
71-2_4792.783_6.78.wav_ASR	but i decided that would actually add to the event if we had people singing from a distance around him
71-2_4800.425_7.26.wav_ASR	so i i took my niece and nephew with me to talk to the waitress staff
71-2_4808.085_1.875.wav_ASR	and firstnamem was then six
71-2_4810.545_1.415.wav_ASR	and firstnamee was eight
71-2_4812.62_1.14.wav_ASR	so they came with me
71-2_4813.825_0.36.wav_ASR	and i said
71-2_4814.405_1.486.wav_ASR	this is what we're gonna do to firstnamed
71-2_4815.905_1.236.wav_ASR	we're gonna go over
71-2_4817.285_1.99.wav_ASR	and we're going to surprise him on his birthday
71-2_4819.275_11.285.wav_ASR	so what we have to do is is we hafta make sure that everybody understands that they're gonna hafta start to sing at some point and that they shouldn't know in advance
71-2_4831.135_4.64.wav_ASR	so firstnamed is over talking to some other relative
71-2_4836.42_3.78.wav_ASR	and firstnamem and firstnamee and i are running around talking to everybody
71-2_4840.48_2.887.wav_ASR	okay now you have to sing very loud
71-2_4843.64_1.672.wav_ASR	but you've gotta be very very quiet
71-2_4845.6_1.096.wav_ASR	this hasta be a surprise
71-2_4847.02_9.14.wav_ASR	so he hears firstnamem talking to his brother probably my other cousin saying
71-2_4856.255_2.8.wav_ASR	now remember to sing very very loud
71-2_4859.535_1.02.wav_ASR	and they're just no laughing
71-2_4861.135_1.305.wav_ASR	they're enjoying this whole process
71-2_4864.14_0.78.wav_ASR	you know and we're just like
71-2_4865.495_0.665.wav_ASR	oh this is gonna be so good
71-2_4866.355_0.48.wav_ASR	and he's going
71-2_4867.715_1.611.wav_ASR	what are they going to do
71-2_4869.355_1.262.wav_ASR	he knew something was coming
71-2_4871.42_5.18.wav_ASR	but he didn't know about the type of production that we had put into it
71-2_4876.94_5.5.wav_ASR	he didn't know about the special candles that wouldn't blow out
71-2_4882.7_11.06.wav_ASR	he didn't know that we were gonna get the the entire people who were waiting on the tables to bring it
71-2_4894.34_6.12.wav_ASR	and he didn't know that everybody in my family would really enjoy the entire process though we're irish
71-2_4900.46_6.912.wav_ASR	and you know we get very kind of loud when we do things like this
71-2_4907.74_2.645.wav_ASR	so yeah of course they came from behind
71-2_4910.64_5.579.wav_ASR	and i only thought one food server was going to bring the cake
71-2_4917.02_1.8.wav_ASR	but instead we had like six or seven
71-2_4919.0_1.337.wav_ASR	everybody decided to come along
71-2_4920.337_2.048.wav_ASR	because they my gosh really gonna be fun
71-2_4922.677_1.435.wav_ASR	and they came from behind
71-2_4924.697_6.411.wav_ASR	and he could tell that it was coming because everybody on the other side are grinning and looking at him
71-2_4931.777_2.24.wav_ASR	and firstnamem and firstnamee are just laughing
71-2_4934.457_1.743.wav_ASR	and they're really jumping around and telling people
71-2_4936.937_0.93.wav_ASR	it's time to sing now
71-2_4938.097_0.862.wav_ASR	it's time to sing now
71-2_4938.959_2.806.wav_ASR	and firstnamed got done
71-2_4941.979_0.74.wav_ASR	he smiled
71-2_4943.099_1.014.wav_ASR	he blew it out
71-2_4944.419_1.009.wav_ASR	he came back up again
71-2_4945.559_0.321.wav_ASR	and i said
71-2_4946.139_1.029.wav_ASR	firstnamed you must be getting old
71-2_4947.999_3.841.wav_ASR	are you at least have the ability to blow out the candles
71-2_4951.84_1.08.wav_ASR	can you at least do that
71-2_4953.279_0.841.wav_ASR	do it again firstnamed
71-2_4955.019_0.65.wav_ASR	come on firstnamed
71-2_4955.879_0.703.wav_ASR	what's going on
71-2_4956.739_1.861.wav_ASR	and he's looking at me
71-2_4958.6_2.165.wav_ASR	and he got down and said
71-2_4961.02_4.396.wav_ASR	you know firstnamep i'm gonna remember this
71-2_4965.96_1.081.wav_ASR	i'm gonna remember this
71-2_4967.18_0.36.wav_ASR	and i said
71-2_4967.76_1.097.wav_ASR	was it a surprise
71-2_4968.88_0.538.wav_ASR	he said
71-2_4969.54_2.689.wav_ASR	it was not a surprise when i heard firstnamem saying
71-2_4972.7_2.78.wav_ASR	remember to sing very very loud
71-2_4976.56_11.193.wav_ASR	so i will say that i i you know i i think i handed the waitress twenty dollars or something for what she had done because she carried it off so well
71-2_4988.7_0.52.wav_ASR	and she said
71-2_4989.46_1.132.wav_ASR	this was so much fun
71-2_4990.7_0.32.wav_ASR	she said
71-2_4991.1_1.881.wav_ASR	your family is so much fun
71-2_4992.981_3.44.wav_ASR	and firstnamed just like looked at me and just
71-2_4998.102_3.085.wav_ASR	well alright yeah anyway that was fun
71-2_5001.681_0.427.wav_ASR	that was great
71-2_5016.87_9.94.wav_ASR	back in the days when i would make peanut butter and jelly sandwich because of course i can't anymore for all sorts of reasons
71-2_5026.95_5.193.wav_ASR	saturated fat and too much sugar and all the rest of it
71-2_5032.23_5.632.wav_ASR	but back in the days when i would've done this what i would've done is i would've started out with the bread
71-2_5038.61_13.295.wav_ASR	and i would've toasted it because the texture of toast works better for me than it does with untoasted bread when it comes to peanut butter and jelly
71-2_5052.65_3.64.wav_ASR	so i would begin by putting it in the toaster
71-2_5056.23_6.16.wav_ASR	and while it's toasting up i would pull out the peanut butter and the jelly
71-2_5063.89_6.546.wav_ASR	when the bread comes out of the toaster i would begin with the peanut butter
71-2_5070.71_0.899.wav_ASR	that goes on the bottom
71-2_5071.89_4.232.wav_ASR	and what i would do with a knife is i would pull out some peanut butter
71-2_5076.47_2.8.wav_ASR	i would spread it evenly on the bread
71-2_5079.93_2.64.wav_ASR	then i would take the other piece of toast
71-2_5083.17_7.54.wav_ASR	and i would take a spoon and spoon out some jelly
71-2_5091.25_1.174.wav_ASR	spread it around evenly
71-2_5093.29_1.54.wav_ASR	and then put the two of them together
71-2_5095.33_3.74.wav_ASR	and probably slice it before i ate it
71-2_5100.37_1.46.wav_ASR	but i don't eat things like that anymore
71-2_5102.25_1.58.wav_ASR	but if i did that's how i would do it
71-2_5111.35_0.5.wav_ASR	okay
71-2_5112.173_4.003.wav_ASR	well i think we talked about this last week
71-2_5116.353_4.662.wav_ASR	i've not done my laundry since last week which means i really needta do it at this point
71-2_5122.17_24.64.wav_ASR	when i do laundry what i'm able to do is not separate separate them from color and white because i've gotten to the point that i only buy clothes that can all be washed in cold water which is also much better for the environment
71-2_5147.64_14.38.wav_ASR	so all of my dirty laundry is already put aside because as clothes begin to fail the smell tests they end up in my basket
71-2_5163.84_1.68.wav_ASR	so when it's time to do laundry
71-2_5205.68_2.96.wav_ASR	my plan is probably tomorrow afternoon
71-2_5208.96_5.54.wav_ASR	i have a break in between two different appointments that will allow me to do that
71-2_5214.8_4.46.wav_ASR	and what i'm going to do is i pull into the laundry which is on streetnamee
71-2_5221.0_3.28.wav_ASR	i think it's about twenty one hundred block
71-2_5224.612_5.38.wav_ASR	i will walk into a medium size washing machine
71-2_5230.452_2.529.wav_ASR	i will put all of my laundry in
71-2_5233.212_2.606.wav_ASR	i will not separate it by color or white
71-2_5236.572_4.435.wav_ASR	i will then add the soap at the top of it
71-2_5241.89_6.96.wav_ASR	then i will put in enough quarters to be able to begin the cycle
71-2_5249.67_3.44.wav_ASR	and i will wash all my clothes on cold
71-2_5253.83_7.3.wav_ASR	after the quarters are in i push the cold water wash
71-2_5261.412_5.86.wav_ASR	and then i take note of the fact that it will take twenty five minutes for it to wash
71-2_5300.51_7.94.wav_ASR	because it's towels and sweaters and things and sweatshirts that will take longer to to dry
71-2_5309.73_7.36.wav_ASR	and then i throw it all back in the hamper and take it home and then sometimes unfold it or put it away
71-2_5317.17_8.72.wav_ASR	and sometimes i just take right out of the clean hamper and put it on my my my body or my bed or whatever i need it
71-2_5335.726_1.6.wav_ASR	okay alright
71-2_5338.086_0.904.wav_ASR	well i've never done that
71-2_5339.206_1.26.wav_ASR	i have tried
71-2_5341.05_1.916.wav_ASR	i will make very clear that i have tried
71-2_5343.826_8.14.wav_ASR	and not ever i have not ever succeeded in doing so for different reasons
71-2_5352.99_2.016.wav_ASR	if i wanted to do it correctly
71-2_5355.43_3.92.wav_ASR	and this is what it says on the seed package
71-2_5360.33_1.64.wav_ASR	which has never worked for me
71-2_5362.41_2.88.wav_ASR	but this is essentially the way that we would do it
71-2_5365.51_1.04.wav_ASR	i would get soiling
71-2_5368.81_1.36.wav_ASR	or i would get
71-2_5370.83_2.38.wav_ASR	i would go to a plant store
71-2_5374.88_3.677.wav_ASR	and there is one that's about a mile and a half from where i live
71-2_5378.64_3.28.wav_ASR	and you buy a special type of topsoil
71-2_5384.1_1.523.wav_ASR	or it it it comes in a bag
71-2_5385.8_1.105.wav_ASR	and i think it's it's
71-2_5387.32_6.933.wav_ASR	all i know is that it's it's it's fertile enough that you should be able to grow things on it
71-2_5394.253_3.88.wav_ASR	and i would put this into a pot
71-2_5398.493_12.547.wav_ASR	i would make sure that there was a hole in it for leakage so that if you put the water in the water if it's excessive water will be able to drain out into a tray
71-2_5412.06_6.94.wav_ASR	put the pot near a window so that there's enough sunlight
71-2_5420.54_3.72.wav_ASR	and what i would do is make sure that the
71-2_5424.56_4.012.wav_ASR	first i would read the directions on the seed package which i've done before
71-2_5429.36_2.358.wav_ASR	which is you have to go down about two inches
71-2_5431.718_2.05.wav_ASR	you take a seed
71-2_5434.438_1.243.wav_ASR	you place it
71-2_5436.118_0.689.wav_ASR	you cover it
71-2_5437.218_1.782.wav_ASR	you water it
71-2_5439.278_1.558.wav_ASR	and then you leave it alone
71-2_5441.258_2.82.wav_ASR	and supposedly nature takes its course
71-2_5444.438_5.88.wav_ASR	in my particular situation one time i didn't have enough sunlight
71-2_5451.69_10.26.wav_ASR	another time i simply overwatered it to the point that the soil was so saturated that the seed rotted
71-2_5463.05_8.069.wav_ASR	and i think the other time it just was too cold in my apartment to be able to sprout in the way that it was supposed to
71-2_5471.119_2.542.wav_ASR	but i've seen other people do it
71-2_5473.819_1.78.wav_ASR	i know the process exists
71-2_5475.839_4.031.wav_ASR	i've just been unable to actually do it in a way that makes it actually work
71-2_5480.75_10.703.wav_ASR	so yeah i'm still in the potential stage of understanding of what you're supposed to be able to do
71-2_5491.453_11.589.wav_ASR	but i haven't yet figured out how to keep the soil dry enough so that it it can sprout without me overwatering it to the point that i rot it
71-2_5503.85_5.443.wav_ASR	so i think there's a balance i haven't yet achieved to be able to do it correctly
84-1_17.07_2.48.wav_ASR	i would hafta say one of my favorite trips
84-1_19.816_4.091.wav_ASR	i have my wife and i have two sons that are older now
84-1_24.096_5.94.wav_ASR	and for a number of years we went skiing in utah in park city
84-1_31.276_2.24.wav_ASR	and i really enjoyed the opportunity
84-1_33.838_6.2.wav_ASR	so my youngest was probably about three years old and my oldest was probably
84-1_40.738_1.181.wav_ASR	well it was probably a little later
84-1_42.198_2.46.wav_ASR	maybe five and seven
84-1_45.878_4.42.wav_ASR	and it was just so much fun to get out there and and learn
84-1_50.529_3.88.wav_ASR	i i could ski already but my two kids
84-1_55.149_1.45.wav_ASR	my wife skied a little bit
84-1_56.809_3.24.wav_ASR	but my two kids became pretty good skiers
84-1_60.329_3.354.wav_ASR	and i am pretty sure that a lot of them was due
84-1_63.693_8.407.wav_ASR	we had a guide when we were in in in in in
84-1_72.333_1.915.wav_ASR	i just lost the name of the place
84-1_74.633_3.58.wav_ASR	in when we were in utah
84-1_78.653_2.88.wav_ASR	and we were guide with him for a number of years
84-1_81.538_1.66.wav_ASR	and he did a really good job
84-1_83.198_9.633.wav_ASR	i hope that will give you a little bit of sense of how number one i enjoy my kids and number two how much i enjoyed skiing with them while when i could
84-1_100.218_1.397.wav_ASR	it it was very nice
84-1_127.149_12.52.wav_ASR	well i just got accepted to be part of the bar again in philadelphia in pennsylvania
84-1_141.089_3.08.wav_ASR	i would say my my skills
84-1_144.711_5.549.wav_ASR	i think my skills are pretty good
84-1_150.311_2.822.wav_ASR	they're never gonna be great as they once were
84-1_153.811_8.199.wav_ASR	so on a scale of one to ten right now i would say i'm probably a seven
84-1_162.21_3.04.wav_ASR	so i feel like i've made a lot of progress
84-1_165.81_5.761.wav_ASR	but i know that there's more progress i need to make especially with with with big words
84-1_172.07_1.91.wav_ASR	big words can be difficult for me
84-1_174.17_3.53.wav_ASR	so i do see a speech therapist once a week
84-1_177.77_3.733.wav_ASR	and she's been extremely extremely helpful for me
84-1_181.503_0.887.wav_ASR	i i like her
84-1_182.39_6.734.wav_ASR	and i also have somebody does some some workout with me
84-1_189.203_1.429.wav_ASR	and the two of them are just great
84-1_196.9_1.27.wav_ASR	oh i remember that pretty well
84-1_207.12_2.95.wav_ASR	well my wife was away for the weekend
84-1_210.39_2.78.wav_ASR	we had a house in oxford maryland
84-1_214.15_3.64.wav_ASR	and i remember that weekend because i hadta work
84-1_217.968_4.82.wav_ASR	and i thought the biggest thing we i could do for the weekend was to stay home
84-1_223.738_8.03.wav_ASR	so i think she probably went down there on maybe wednesday or thursday
84-1_232.508_2.66.wav_ASR	and i came home from work on friday
84-1_236.128_0.848.wav_ASR	i had dinner
84-1_236.976_0.998.wav_ASR	i did some work
84-1_238.176_2.0.wav_ASR	i get up the next morning
84-1_240.536_5.24.wav_ASR	so that was the thirty thirtieth of may
84-1_247.676_1.721.wav_ASR	and i felt pretty good
84-1_249.716_1.188.wav_ASR	i went about my day
84-1_251.576_2.08.wav_ASR	i went out for a bicycle ride
84-1_254.296_1.0.wav_ASR	and i came home
84-1_255.22_20.6.wav_ASR	and that night was i think a week maybe after floyd was killed in in minneapolis
84-1_276.504_5.66.wav_ASR	and so on saturday night i went to bed a little bit early
84-1_282.524_4.46.wav_ASR	because well i i thought there might be some violence
84-1_287.724_3.66.wav_ASR	and i also thought it would be helpful in the morning
84-1_291.464_1.784.wav_ASR	so i could clean up a little bit
84-1_293.7_2.69.wav_ASR	so we live in a fairly nice area
84-1_297.14_2.43.wav_ASR	and i went to bed around ten thirty
84-1_300.6_5.7.wav_ASR	and saturday night there was a lot of violence in in center city philadelphia
84-1_307.16_3.84.wav_ASR	and i remember that that a building was burned
84-1_315.929_2.242.wav_ASR	and so i got up
84-1_318.529_2.98.wav_ASR	i i live in a fairly secure place
84-1_322.129_4.884.wav_ASR	and the next morning i got up really early and went outside
84-1_327.229_1.08.wav_ASR	and it was a total mess
84-1_329.189_1.324.wav_ASR	so i started cleaning up
84-1_331.129_3.4.wav_ASR	and sometime during the day i felt a little bit shaky
84-1_334.969_1.819.wav_ASR	so i went back home
84-1_337.0_1.019.wav_ASR	i rested for a little
84-1_338.309_1.26.wav_ASR	i went out and got a paper
84-1_340.069_2.184.wav_ASR	and then i felt pretty good for the rest of the day
84-1_342.769_10.717.wav_ASR	and sometime on that sunday night between may thirty first and june first i had my stroke
84-1_354.11_3.04.wav_ASR	and in the morning my wife could not get ahold of me
84-1_357.75_1.397.wav_ASR	so we have a doorman here
84-1_359.39_0.831.wav_ASR	and he went up
84-1_360.85_1.3.wav_ASR	and i was on the floor
84-1_362.37_2.0.wav_ASR	and so he called an ambulance
84-1_364.67_4.58.wav_ASR	and i i my wife was in oxford maryland
84-1_369.477_7.22.wav_ASR	so she was told that that
84-1_377.397_1.08.wav_ASR	see i'm bad with pronouns
84-1_378.897_3.68.wav_ASR	that that my wife should come home
84-1_382.428_8.24.wav_ASR	and i have two sons one who's in new orleans and one who's in san francisco
84-1_391.348_6.86.wav_ASR	and they were told it was probably a good idea for them to come home because i wasn't sure what was gonna happen
84-1_398.267_6.5.wav_ASR	and so i remember distinctly that i was brought into the emergency room
84-1_405.227_2.72.wav_ASR	and apparently i i could not say a lot
84-1_407.987_2.86.wav_ASR	my my voice was very garbled
84-1_411.47_14.3.wav_ASR	but by the end of the procedure my my wife told me later that she wasn't sure what she she was not sure what kind of shape i'd be in
84-1_425.77_14.463.wav_ASR	but by the end of the surgery which was i had a blood vessel the surgeon thought that i was going to be able to live
84-1_440.31_3.579.wav_ASR	but they didn't know how much exactly i'll be able to do
84-1_444.38_6.0.wav_ASR	so i i'd spent about six eight weeks in rehab
84-1_451.21_2.29.wav_ASR	and i came out not sure what i could do
84-1_453.84_4.18.wav_ASR	so today i i feel pretty good about my voice
84-1_458.6_2.9.wav_ASR	but as i said i still feel like there's more i can do
84-1_462.06_4.25.wav_ASR	so as i said i think i'm about seventy percent right now
84-1_478.63_9.28.wav_ASR	well i was in rehab for eight weeks in a place that's about maybe eight blocks from here
84-1_488.29_1.76.wav_ASR	and it was a time when it was covid
84-1_490.47_3.04.wav_ASR	so it wasn't really easy for me to see people
84-1_494.13_3.84.wav_ASR	but one of the people where we live
84-1_498.084_2.28.wav_ASR	because i live in a high story building
84-1_501.2_9.29.wav_ASR	one of the persons was maybe the second or third command at jefferson which is where i went to for my rehab
84-1_511.17_8.41.wav_ASR	and this person whose name is kate they were allowed to get two people in to see me a day
84-1_520.09_3.903.wav_ASR	well my two sisters came in
84-1_524.19_2.789.wav_ASR	and then my my children came in
84-1_527.21_2.02.wav_ASR	and then my wife came in
84-1_529.33_4.5.wav_ASR	so i had a very good treatment
84-1_534.47_8.45.wav_ASR	and so each day i would have o t p t and speech
84-1_543.73_2.66.wav_ASR	so that was every day except for saturdays and sundays
84-1_554.07_3.15.wav_ASR	well there's nothing i can do about that
84-1_558.98_2.94.wav_ASR	so i i mean i understood i hadta deal with that
84-1_562.65_2.916.wav_ASR	and i didn't always deal with it but i tried to
84-1_590.17_3.99.wav_ASR	well i hafta tell you i've had a pretty good life until my stroke
84-1_595.73_3.421.wav_ASR	i would say that one of the best things that ever happened to me was
84-1_599.151_7.46.wav_ASR	i was in a program at a school called wesleyan which is in middletown connecticut
84-1_607.212_12.7.wav_ASR	and when i was there part of this this program i was in this consortium responded made it so that i hadta spend a semester abroad
84-1_620.93_9.96.wav_ASR	and during starting in seventh grade through high school and then into college i spoke french pretty well
84-1_631.61_7.66.wav_ASR	because i had a teacher in in winnetka who was at the time going out with one of the cubs baseball players
84-1_639.596_3.36.wav_ASR	and so she was french
84-1_643.098_1.783.wav_ASR	and she useta talk about that a lot
84-1_645.456_2.323.wav_ASR	and so i took a class from her
84-1_648.376_1.811.wav_ASR	and somehow i did pretty well
84-1_650.376_6.36.wav_ASR	so then i was in the program at at wesleyan
84-1_657.064_3.6.wav_ASR	and i would say one of the happiest occasions for me was graduating
84-1_661.59_8.094.wav_ASR	i wound up doing pretty well at the school and even though i had gotten in on a waitlist
84-1_670.684_1.52.wav_ASR	and it was really exciting
84-1_672.25_9.12.wav_ASR	i i i i knew a bunch of people in my class but i was really close with the class behind me the class of eighty
84-1_681.67_2.875.wav_ASR	and it was just a fun time for me
84-1_684.545_1.765.wav_ASR	i i was president of my fraternity
84-1_687.01_6.06.wav_ASR	and i i i met someone who became one of my closest friends
84-1_693.27_2.1.wav_ASR	he was the provost at wesleyan
84-1_695.55_2.306.wav_ASR	so i i it was really nice
84-1_698.38_8.68.wav_ASR	after i graduated from high college i spent some vacations with him and some of my roommates
84-1_707.68_2.16.wav_ASR	he he was someone who was remarkable
84-1_710.58_2.476.wav_ASR	he went to harvard law school
84-1_713.273_5.48.wav_ASR	and at the end of his freshman year he won the moot court competition
84-1_719.733_2.72.wav_ASR	and he went down to the bookstore
84-1_722.973_3.56.wav_ASR	and he bought all books about italian renaissance history
84-1_726.863_7.22.wav_ASR	so he went back to to campus and he changed
84-1_734.443_1.76.wav_ASR	he he was already in law school
84-1_736.563_2.08.wav_ASR	he had been undergraduate at princeton
84-1_739.263_4.24.wav_ASR	and he after his first year of winning the moot court he said
84-1_743.663_0.992.wav_ASR	this wasn't for me
84-1_744.8_5.82.wav_ASR	and at harvard he went to a a program in italian renaissance history
84-1_756.57_3.48.wav_ASR	yeah it was a good place for me
84-1_764.754_4.32.wav_ASR	i haven't been visiting since my stroke
84-1_769.655_5.279.wav_ASR	but you know i useta be fairly involved at at the university
84-1_775.834_6.1.wav_ASR	and my youngest son went there after spending a year in scotland
84-1_782.807_7.94.wav_ASR	and he was he did really well at the school
84-1_790.907_3.04.wav_ASR	so i was very excited for him
84-1_828.61_2.67.wav_ASR	well i happen to know these pictures quite well
84-1_832.07_3.18.wav_ASR	it's a story about a kid playing soccer
84-1_836.05_3.3.wav_ASR	and he he striked the ball
84-1_839.99_3.52.wav_ASR	and it went through the window of a nearby house
84-1_843.796_24.848.wav_ASR	and landed inside the house where it was taken by one of the young or middle aged husband or just a a regular person who lived in the house
84-1_868.644_20.254.wav_ASR	and then he looked out the window to see if he could figure out who may have hit hit hit the soccer ball so that it landed on his close to his lap i think
84-1_907.89_1.94.wav_ASR	this one i also know
84-1_909.988_8.342.wav_ASR	is it's about a young boy who when he went to school he was deciding whether or not to take an umbrella
84-1_918.59_2.6.wav_ASR	he decided not to take the umbrella
84-1_921.69_2.48.wav_ASR	and it turned out that it it started raining
84-1_924.87_1.88.wav_ASR	so he went back home
84-1_926.94_1.818.wav_ASR	and he was soaking wet
84-1_929.34_2.127.wav_ASR	but apparently he changed his clothes
84-1_932.02_5.76.wav_ASR	and he went back outside with a umbrella so that he could get to school
84-1_938.24_6.041.wav_ASR	i assume he went to school on time but i really don't know whether that's part of the story or not
84-1_957.58_7.15.wav_ASR	so this is a little girl maybe under ten who had a cat who was stuck up in a tree
84-1_965.45_7.58.wav_ASR	so apparently the the dad got a ladder
84-1_973.283_3.967.wav_ASR	the girl was on a tricycle
84-1_977.59_1.904.wav_ASR	but she stopped and looked at the cat
84-1_979.94_19.956.wav_ASR	so the the the the the the the the father went up to get the cat
84-1_999.896_13.754.wav_ASR	and i guess the the the ladder got kicked away so that the the husband was stuck up there with the cat
84-1_1014.556_2.6.wav_ASR	and the the dog started barking
84-1_1017.78_2.68.wav_ASR	and eventually the fire department came
84-1_1021.24_0.94.wav_ASR	and they were able
84-1_1022.44_0.5.wav_ASR	i presume
84-1_1023.32_0.654.wav_ASR	i don't know
84-1_1024.06_3.563.wav_ASR	but i think they were able to get the cat and get the man down
84-1_1188.54_7.06.wav_ASR	so this is a story about a young woman named cinderella
84-1_1196.189_19.982.wav_ASR	and she was working at a place where there was a a middle aged lady and two people who had grown up with her and was interested in trying to get someone to marry them
84-1_1216.59_15.38.wav_ASR	so it turned out that there was a young prince who was living his with his family
84-1_1232.85_29.52.wav_ASR	and the young prince decided that they should get together and have a ball so that maybe the people from the community could find out if anybody if if the girls were possibly interested in in having a relationship with the prince
84-1_1263.48_2.52.wav_ASR	i don't remember the name of the prince
84-1_1266.09_4.89.wav_ASR	but so they sent around an invitation to all the people in the community
84-1_1272.04_9.98.wav_ASR	and the two young ladies who lived with her
84-1_1284.38_8.84.wav_ASR	her older mother decided that they would go to the ball and started getting dressed to go to the ball
84-1_1293.98_17.52.wav_ASR	but cinderella who was like a caretaker on the property and was stuck doing things like washing clothes and cleaning the floor and stuff like that she found out about there being this ball
84-1_1312.413_4.54.wav_ASR	and she wanted to know if there was some way she could attend
84-1_1317.593_1.78.wav_ASR	so she
84-1_1320.333_2.28.wav_ASR	i don't remember exactly how it happened
84-1_1323.133_6.02.wav_ASR	but she was able to get in touch with somebody i think they called the fairy godmother
84-1_1330.065_3.52.wav_ASR	and she talked to the fairy godmother
84-1_1334.45_20.985.wav_ASR	and so while the two people from the house were going with her her her older lady to the dance she decided that she could go
84-1_1355.435_4.2.wav_ASR	so she got dressed up in in fancy clothing
84-1_1360.415_5.337.wav_ASR	and she was told by the fairy godmother that she could go to the ball
84-1_1365.795_1.72.wav_ASR	but she had only one request
84-1_1368.295_2.94.wav_ASR	and that is that she'd be be back by midnight
84-1_1371.407_11.811.wav_ASR	so she went to the ball and fell in love the prince with the prince and was having a good time with the prince
84-1_1383.218_12.28.wav_ASR	but when the clock strike struck midnight cinderella knew that she hadta get out of there
84-1_1396.098_5.08.wav_ASR	so she raced for the door and down the steps and into the carriage
84-1_1401.35_2.26.wav_ASR	but soon the carriage disappeared
84-1_1404.69_9.9.wav_ASR	and she was by herself with some young people who may have been rabbits and other members of the community
84-1_1415.23_19.09.wav_ASR	so she she found out that the young prince was looking for the the young lady who had disappeared disappeared at midnight
84-1_1434.84_11.51.wav_ASR	and he sent out a some sort of plea or something that if the person was around she should please contact him
84-1_1446.76_12.16.wav_ASR	and when that didn't happen then a young man went around the village to see if by chance anybody knew anything about this young lady
84-1_1459.92_3.1.wav_ASR	and when he went to the house that had the two
84-1_1463.595_2.1.wav_ASR	i guess you might by now call them spinsters
84-1_1468.04_9.89.wav_ASR	she somehow got ahold of cinderella who may be washing clothes in the basement or something like that
84-1_1478.88_7.897.wav_ASR	and when she was brought upstairs the one shoe that had been left behind she tried on that one shoe
84-1_1486.777_13.623.wav_ASR	and it fit her so that it he knew that the young prince was going to continue to like this young lady
84-1_1501.077_2.06.wav_ASR	and so i guess they got back together
84-1_1503.537_1.94.wav_ASR	and eventually they got married
84-1_1550.75_3.76.wav_ASR	i never really had a lot of experiences with clocks
84-1_1555.47_3.2.wav_ASR	i was pretty much always on time
84-1_1559.37_10.68.wav_ASR	and when i was growing up particularly when i was in high school there for some reason was no real time limit on what time i hadta get home
84-1_1570.61_8.74.wav_ASR	so i went to a lot of parties on friday night and saturday night and could come home when i wanted
84-1_1579.38_20.6.wav_ASR	i think it was in large part because my two social worker parents decided that the two of them really hadta teach me how to be comfortable with myself and then to be able to know when i was out too late
84-1_1600.084_3.495.wav_ASR	so i mean there were a few times when i was out too late
84-1_1604.124_2.309.wav_ASR	but nothing really ever happened to me
84-1_1606.924_3.866.wav_ASR	and then when i went to college i would come home during the summertime
84-1_1611.804_6.56.wav_ASR	and i remember that i was involved with a couple young ladies
84-1_1618.528_4.623.wav_ASR	but i would go out with them but i could get home whenever i wanted to
84-1_1623.52_6.58.wav_ASR	and i remember once that summer i had a job that required me to be to work at six o'clock in the morning
84-1_1630.928_3.42.wav_ASR	so sometimes during the summer i would stay out all night and then go to work
84-1_1645.61_7.485.wav_ASR	well so i worked a lot particularly when i turned out to be
84-1_1653.47_2.186.wav_ASR	i think i may have told you this
84-1_1655.73_0.463.wav_ASR	i'm not sure
84-1_1656.193_3.42.wav_ASR	but i worked for a french company for years
84-1_1660.878_8.049.wav_ASR	and i when i had my stroke i started thinking about things i could do
84-1_1668.927_8.2.wav_ASR	because really between vacations and between a lot of time i spent particularly with my children
84-1_1678.067_2.92.wav_ASR	because they were in a town in new jersey called princeton
84-1_1681.727_2.08.wav_ASR	and they both played a lot of hockey
84-1_1684.367_2.89.wav_ASR	so i never really had a lot of time
84-1_1687.246_2.783.wav_ASR	but one thing i decided i'm going to do
84-1_1690.506_4.76.wav_ASR	because within the next year we're gonna be moving a little further south
84-1_1695.886_3.08.wav_ASR	and i really thought that one thing i could do was birdwatching
84-1_1699.586_2.933.wav_ASR	because i've always had an interest in that
84-1_1702.606_1.984.wav_ASR	but i've never really focused on that
84-1_1705.086_1.62.wav_ASR	and i really thought particularly
84-1_1706.856_2.9.wav_ASR	now i ride a three wheel bicycle
84-1_1709.936_4.506.wav_ASR	i can't ride a a two wheel bicycle like i useta do
84-1_1714.521_16.081.wav_ASR	so i'm really hoping that when we move i can learn about birds and maybe become somewhat of an interest in in in birdwatching because i think that would be a good thing for me to do
84-1_1736.76_2.52.wav_ASR	oh so did she live in bloomington
84-1_1760.0_20.64.wav_ASR	well i guess when i started traveling for this french company i was mainly responsible for the united states canada and mexico
84-1_1780.938_3.5.wav_ASR	but they quickly figured out that i could speak
84-1_1785.098_1.94.wav_ASR	most of the lawyers were in france
84-1_1787.898_2.948.wav_ASR	and i was one of the few lawyers outside of france
84-1_1791.078_1.06.wav_ASR	i was in the united states
84-1_1793.658_4.48.wav_ASR	so they useta send me to various places
84-1_1798.398_5.96.wav_ASR	and i remember that i stayed in a real nice hotel in buenos aires
84-1_1805.978_2.42.wav_ASR	and i also stayed in a nice hotel
84-1_1809.158_3.84.wav_ASR	i was in a nice hotel when i went to china
84-1_1813.177_5.8.wav_ASR	and i also was in a nice hotel when i was in australia
84-1_1822.457_6.54.wav_ASR	and during one of the times i was there and it was the fourth of july
84-1_1829.537_3.16.wav_ASR	so i remember that the staff brought me a little cake
84-1_1833.15_7.12.wav_ASR	so i i i i i don't really need a big hotel although my wife likes them
84-1_1841.05_10.3.wav_ASR	i i always thought i was in places that i could be comfortable even when
84-1_1851.626_2.28.wav_ASR	even i i i do remember staying in one hotel
84-1_1854.01_5.896.wav_ASR	i was in birmingham alabama for for to to be part of a case that was pending
84-1_1860.446_2.235.wav_ASR	and we stayed in a godawfuladj hotel
84-1_1862.726_3.066.wav_ASR	but even that turned out to be good for me
84-1_1865.941_11.7.wav_ASR	so it was a good way for me to learn about the way different hotels can treat me differently
84-1_1878.421_3.38.wav_ASR	i i was in a hotel in a bad part of town in birmingham
84-1_1882.0_1.381.wav_ASR	i remember that pretty well
84-1_1897.088_7.408.wav_ASR	well when i was in college there was this person
84-1_1904.816_0.654.wav_ASR	i think i told you
84-1_1905.47_0.58.wav_ASR	the provost
84-1_1906.59_6.9.wav_ASR	and he was there for about about thirty thirty five years
84-1_1913.91_2.92.wav_ASR	and in nineteen ninety nine he died
84-1_1917.85_5.54.wav_ASR	but before that time he and a group of people
84-1_1923.607_16.1.wav_ASR	there was a one person from the class of sixty five one person from the class of sixty two and then a person from the class of seventy nine which was me and a person from the class of eighty
84-1_1939.914_5.6.wav_ASR	the five of us became very good friends
84-1_1945.874_9.776.wav_ASR	and because firstnamew did not really have any friends
84-1_1955.75_8.1.wav_ASR	he had a child who died when when when he was maybe six or seven years old
84-1_1964.11_8.96.wav_ASR	and and so one thing he useta do once a quarter from connecticut he useta go down to new york city
84-1_1973.501_5.94.wav_ASR	and i went for my graduation
84-1_1979.861_3.68.wav_ASR	and i went for every year thereafter for about twenty five years
84-1_1983.921_5.12.wav_ASR	i went to a place that's no longer in existence but it's called blue test
84-1_1989.678_3.6.wav_ASR	and it was a a very nice place
84-1_1994.718_3.712.wav_ASR	and we just had a wonderful time every year i was there
84-1_1998.43_14.51.wav_ASR	so i really think back upon that a lot and remember just how much fun i had with these people and how much i still keep in contact with them
84-1_2012.94_5.74.wav_ASR	and so these these people are some very wellknown people
84-1_2019.2_6.8.wav_ASR	and so one of the wives has already died
84-1_2026.88_4.22.wav_ASR	but he was the head of this thing called the the
84-1_2031.651_17.0.wav_ASR	it they work for a family
84-1_2048.851_0.828.wav_ASR	i forgot the name
84-1_2049.811_1.4.wav_ASR	but they have a huge trust
84-1_2051.568_3.28.wav_ASR	and so he's gonna retire and move back to new york city
84-1_2055.648_10.086.wav_ASR	so i'm very excited that at the end of september i'm gonna be meeting with them and and these people who go back to the class of sixty two
84-1_2066.128_2.086.wav_ASR	so i'm i'm looking forward to that
84-1_2068.397_8.98.wav_ASR	i i i i some days i kind of wish i would be in a little better strength than i am now
84-1_2077.677_3.26.wav_ASR	they all know i had a stroke
84-1_2081.677_3.36.wav_ASR	but i i'm really looking forward
84-1_2085.17_5.06.wav_ASR	some days i think that maybe i shouldn't go because i'm not far enough along
84-1_2090.73_1.56.wav_ASR	but it it
84-1_2093.19_1.8.wav_ASR	i can't even remember what we were talking about
84-1_2100.86_4.44.wav_ASR	so so so we went to this very nice restaurant
84-1_2105.464_2.296.wav_ASR	and we did it for about twenty or twenty five years
84-1_2108.22_5.907.wav_ASR	and it was a good place for me and for the other people that were in the group
84-1_2114.08_11.39.wav_ASR	we useta do it every year in december because it was near the time when one of our favorite people from the class of sixty two had a birthday
84-1_2132.16_4.04.wav_ASR	it was a french restaurant called called lutece
84-1_2137.66_14.62.wav_ASR	yeah it's if if you go back to the nineteen seventies and eighties and look up the restaurant it's at two fifty nine east fiftieth street
84-1_2152.28_7.02.wav_ASR	you'll it's in a nice old building that has three or four floors
84-1_2159.56_1.7.wav_ASR	and it was exquisite
84-1_2161.495_22.32.wav_ASR	and because because firstnamew would go there on three or four times throughout the year he knew the staff really really well so that when we came in for the birthday party it was just fantastic
84-1_2184.085_1.14.wav_ASR	it was really nice
84-1_2189.53_1.988.wav_ASR	it's not there anymore yeah
84-1_2191.525_0.84.wav_ASR	it was sold
84-1_2192.725_1.984.wav_ASR	there was a an owner and his wife
84-1_2195.385_3.86.wav_ASR	and i think they eventually you know was retired
84-1_2199.985_8.94.wav_ASR	and they sold the restaurant to a guy who was i think from either france or from germany
84-1_2210.365_2.624.wav_ASR	and he did not do a very good job
84-1_2212.939_7.3.wav_ASR	so it i would say after three or four years it it it it it didn't exist anymore
84-1_2224.89_2.489.wav_ASR	so we're going to
84-1_2228.519_2.26.wav_ASR	so the fellow who it was
84-1_2231.118_5.52.wav_ASR	i wish i could remember the name of the place that he was involved in miami
84-1_2237.538_4.0.wav_ASR	but he he has one son who's got three wonderful children
84-1_2242.058_2.84.wav_ASR	and they live in in north jersey
84-1_2245.216_14.64.wav_ASR	so my my friend who's now widowed is has has fixed up a place i think in the fifties or sixties in new york city
84-1_2260.677_6.594.wav_ASR	so i know that's where the party's gonna be because the apartment is apparently finished now
84-1_2267.297_1.81.wav_ASR	he's been working on it for a couple years
84-1_2290.78_3.59.wav_ASR	oh interestingly enough i had one for lunch
84-1_2296.1_4.56.wav_ASR	i like it once in a while
84-1_2300.734_16.34.wav_ASR	who one of the people who's part of the group from lutece is a fellow from the class of sixty five or sixty six
84-1_2317.101_4.2.wav_ASR	and he has a peanut butter and jelly sandwich every day for lunch
84-1_2321.761_2.78.wav_ASR	but what you do is you take two pieces of bread
84-1_2325.321_9.159.wav_ASR	i have my bread in the freezer because i only use a certain amount of it every day
84-1_2335.061_1.789.wav_ASR	so i take the pieces of bread out
84-1_2336.89_7.96.wav_ASR	i i i they come to room temperature
84-1_2347.07_2.92.wav_ASR	then i have a special peanut butter that i use
84-1_2350.01_1.08.wav_ASR	have you ever been to costco
84-1_2353.6_1.85.wav_ASR	well the peanut butter there is natural
84-1_2356.05_2.9.wav_ASR	so that's the peanut butter i buy
84-1_2359.35_3.68.wav_ASR	and we have a few jars of that around
84-1_2363.63_3.48.wav_ASR	so i would open the jar take some peanut butter
84-1_2367.83_2.504.wav_ASR	and then i would take different kinds of jelly
84-1_2370.434_9.058.wav_ASR	but right now i'm on on a kick where i have blueberry strawberry and raspberry together in a mix
84-1_2380.014_1.86.wav_ASR	and i put that on the sandwich
84-1_2382.514_2.34.wav_ASR	then i close the sandwich
84-1_2385.454_3.553.wav_ASR	and you can either cut it in half or leave it whole
84-1_2389.007_2.9.wav_ASR	and for some stupid reason i always leave it whole
84-1_2392.387_1.62.wav_ASR	and i had what was a nice sandwich
84-1_2394.347_5.34.wav_ASR	so i had that about one thirty as i was preparing for my two o'clock call
84-1_2413.71_5.31.wav_ASR	well laundry is something i still try to do but i think my wife probably does more of it
84-1_2420.092_4.906.wav_ASR	so i would choose what kind of temperature i would want it
84-1_2424.998_6.36.wav_ASR	but typically i would choose cold water because most of the stuff i need to wash is cold water
84-1_2431.958_3.042.wav_ASR	so we have a machine
84-1_2435.278_2.14.wav_ASR	now we live in a an apartment
84-1_2437.656_7.8.wav_ASR	we live in an area that was where we hafta buy the condominium
84-1_2446.076_9.42.wav_ASR	but because we're getting ready to move next year we sold our condominium and we moved into a rental unit in the same building
84-1_2455.617_4.36.wav_ASR	so we would get the water set
84-1_2461.32_13.017.wav_ASR	once the water set it's a machine that it it it comes out on the side
84-1_2474.39_1.33.wav_ASR	so there's nothing on the top
84-1_2476.55_1.89.wav_ASR	so we hafta load the washer
84-1_2479.39_8.06.wav_ASR	and then we put the the laundry detergent in it and start it running
84-1_2487.48_6.74.wav_ASR	we can see it from the outside
84-1_2495.135_8.325.wav_ASR	it's something that is easy to see from the floor
84-1_2504.52_2.52.wav_ASR	and so we put it on washq
84-1_2507.302_4.58.wav_ASR	and it usually lasts for some reason for an hour and five minutes
84-1_2512.062_3.808.wav_ASR	but after an hour and five minutes the wash is done
84-1_2515.962_6.0.wav_ASR	and if we have particular clothes that need to be put on a line we would typically put it on the line
84-1_2522.162_4.18.wav_ASR	and the rest of it would go into the dryer where it would dry
84-1_2526.352_8.24.wav_ASR	and then it would be ready to be folded and put in the couple of drawers that we use for for laundry
84-1_2535.332_2.932.wav_ASR	my wife has quite a few more than i do
84-1_2538.264_8.158.wav_ASR	but it's a place where we can put our stuff and use it as we need to
84-1_2557.42_3.87.wav_ASR	well you hafta understand that now it takes me a while
84-1_2562.42_5.82.wav_ASR	so i usually get up in the morning
84-1_2568.47_8.6.wav_ASR	and i will put on my underwear
84-1_2578.86_3.09.wav_ASR	and then i would put on my shirt
84-1_2583.37_2.06.wav_ASR	and i would put on my socks
84-1_2586.38_6.68.wav_ASR	and then i would lie in bed for a little bit and do some exercise because exercise is very important to me
84-1_2593.52_9.62.wav_ASR	especially even though i'm nearly more than three years out it's still important for me to to get some exercise in every day
84-1_2603.74_0.96.wav_ASR	so i do that
84-1_2604.776_5.64.wav_ASR	and then i will typically once that is done i'll turn on the tv
84-1_2610.876_6.2.wav_ASR	and i'll get dressed the rest of my way which includes you know my socks
84-1_2617.536_4.7.wav_ASR	and you haven't seen this but i wear a brace on my right foot
84-1_2622.416_1.873.wav_ASR	so i put that on as well
84-1_2624.77_4.28.wav_ASR	and i i start my day
84-2_12.09_1.1.wav_ASR	my favorite holiday
84-2_13.79_9.28.wav_ASR	it's easily thanksgiving because i have a very small family but usually the family comes as well as my two sons
84-2_24.03_1.468.wav_ASR	and now one of them's married
84-2_25.77_2.32.wav_ASR	and the other is gonna be married pretty soon
84-2_28.25_4.26.wav_ASR	so i look forward to a table with a few more people
84-2_32.564_2.32.wav_ASR	i have two sisters
84-2_35.624_2.44.wav_ASR	one of them who lives i think i told you in new york
84-2_38.244_1.46.wav_ASR	and one of them who lives in chicago
84-2_40.424_2.76.wav_ASR	so they typically come
84-2_43.573_14.028.wav_ASR	and for many many years until i had my stroke i was in charge of the cooking of the turkey which i do on a grill
84-2_58.053_1.58.wav_ASR	so it's really really nice
84-2_60.413_2.52.wav_ASR	but now i don't do it on the grill anymore
84-2_63.47_4.5.wav_ASR	and we useta have a place at the shore but we don't have that anymore
84-2_68.71_4.28.wav_ASR	so i somebody else cooks it in the oven
84-2_78.94_7.65.wav_ASR	well i've been the host for thanksgiving since my mother died in nineteen ninety eight
84-2_86.96_1.04.wav_ASR	so it's been a while
84-2_92.66_0.372.wav_ASR	it is
84-2_93.22_2.6.wav_ASR	it's it's nice but it doesn't last for very long
84-2_100.512_2.1.wav_ASR	we celebrate hanukkah
84-2_103.112_6.44.wav_ASR	so we don't even give presents anymore
84-2_109.668_11.36.wav_ASR	unfortunately both of the young ladies that my two sons married are both not jewish
84-2_121.788_3.708.wav_ASR	one of them has no religion which is fine with me
84-2_125.777_3.18.wav_ASR	and one of them is basically christian
84-2_130.297_4.6.wav_ASR	but i think she likes celebrating hanukkah as well
84-2_154.92_3.84.wav_ASR	my speech is probably the thing that i'm working on the most
84-2_159.16_7.84.wav_ASR	as you know i used to be a lawyer and i've just gone back on active duty
84-2_167.46_3.07.wav_ASR	so i can still be a lawyer if i wanna be a lawyer
84-2_171.22_15.68.wav_ASR	but i i feel that a lot of times especially with small words and pronouns and with hisq and herq and leftq and rightq i'm not great with that
84-2_187.36_3.34.wav_ASR	so that that i hafta think for a while
84-2_190.722_2.64.wav_ASR	especially now that firstnamel does more
84-2_193.622_1.4.wav_ASR	well firstnamel does all the driving
84-2_195.302_2.954.wav_ASR	i hafta remember which is left and which is right
84-2_198.782_1.54.wav_ASR	that confuses me sometimes
84-2_200.742_3.33.wav_ASR	and i'm i'm pretty good about backward and forward
84-2_204.582_2.796.wav_ASR	and i'm hoping that i'll be able to drive at some point
84-2_207.378_8.784.wav_ASR	not that i really wanna drive because i i've always driven a lot but i've never been particularly interested in driving
84-2_216.44_9.7.wav_ASR	i just do it because my wife sits in the other seat and my two kids when they were around sometimes they would drive but sometimes they would also sit in the back
84-2_227.22_6.2.wav_ASR	but but now since my stroke my wife does all the driving
84-2_234.05_6.33.wav_ASR	and as i say i think maybe in a year or so i may be able to start driving again
84-2_240.74_0.76.wav_ASR	i'm i'm not sure
84-2_247.16_2.58.wav_ASR	don't tell my wife that but yes it's true
84-2_257.54_0.74.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
84-2_263.0_2.98.wav_ASR	oh yeah i i remember my stroke pretty well
84-2_273.18_11.211.wav_ASR	well i was in the hospital for about eight days before i went to the rehab program which is also connected to thomas jefferson hospital
84-2_285.39_20.682.wav_ASR	and that's where in my area of town which is near rittenhouse square instead of going up to penn which is probably about maybe ten blocks from here we go down to jefferson which is probably around about the same
84-2_306.65_15.44.wav_ASR	and you know i think i told you that on sunday morning i went out because there was a riot the night before from the guy up in minnesota
84-2_322.53_1.5.wav_ASR	i forget his name right now
84-2_324.03_2.88.wav_ASR	so there's a huge riot
84-2_327.03_2.723.wav_ASR	we had a building actually burned here
84-2_330.29_4.617.wav_ASR	and i went out at about six o'clock in the morning to start cleaning up
84-2_335.07_2.209.wav_ASR	and i was one of the few people out there
84-2_337.63_2.1.wav_ASR	and i remember there being a ton of cleanup
84-2_339.843_5.105.wav_ASR	and so i was there for about six to nine o'clock in the morning
84-2_345.103_1.957.wav_ASR	and then i went to get a newspaper
84-2_347.387_0.994.wav_ASR	i didn't feel great
84-2_348.683_2.769.wav_ASR	so i lie lie laid down for a little bit
84-2_351.763_2.48.wav_ASR	and then i went to work in the afternoon
84-2_354.303_6.287.wav_ASR	and by the evening i was starting to feel a little worse but not terribly worse
84-2_361.05_2.15.wav_ASR	and i went to bed around ten thirty
84-2_364.003_2.577.wav_ASR	and i had my stroke in the middle of the night
84-2_367.183_3.063.wav_ASR	and in the morning my wife could not get ahold of me
84-2_370.723_2.645.wav_ASR	so we have a concierge who came up and found me
84-2_373.648_1.7.wav_ASR	and they took me to the hospital
84-2_375.668_2.58.wav_ASR	and that's when i spent about eight days in the hospital
84-2_378.928_4.34.wav_ASR	because because it was during covid
84-2_383.468_2.537.wav_ASR	so i really didn't see anybody there
84-2_386.828_5.56.wav_ASR	and it was difficult for me because i feel felt my talking was not great
84-2_392.4_3.057.wav_ASR	and it was just difficult for me
84-2_395.58_4.82.wav_ASR	so i mean i must have watched tv
84-2_400.74_2.02.wav_ASR	and i was in a room by myself
84-2_402.991_12.52.wav_ASR	and eventually on a monday night about a week and a couple days later i went to mcgee which is only about six blocks away
84-2_415.551_0.838.wav_ASR	it was pretty close
84-2_416.971_3.157.wav_ASR	and so that's when i stayed for two months
84-2_430.74_2.047.wav_ASR	oh i've done a lot of things to try to get better
84-2_433.0_1.662.wav_ASR	i i don't know if all of them works but
84-2_435.24_3.841.wav_ASR	so i was in the hospital for for eight weeks
84-2_439.239_9.64.wav_ASR	and every day except the weekends i had o t and p t
84-2_449.599_1.36.wav_ASR	and then i also had speech
84-2_451.039_1.499.wav_ASR	and that was typically in the morning
84-2_453.139_4.394.wav_ASR	and then in the afternoon i for a while i didn't do anything
84-2_457.533_3.458.wav_ASR	but then eventually i started going to art
84-2_461.433_4.9.wav_ASR	and i i i did some stuff but it wasn't really very good
84-2_467.093_6.865.wav_ASR	and i thought by the time i left there i wasn't so sure i was gonna do it
84-2_474.15_7.18.wav_ASR	so i tried it a little bit more at mcgee which is where i go for outpatient
84-2_481.83_0.958.wav_ASR	and it wasn't great
84-2_483.11_2.78.wav_ASR	but soon they introduced a music program
84-2_486.65_2.184.wav_ASR	and i was always interested in singing
84-2_489.35_2.38.wav_ASR	but i don't sing a lot
84-2_491.79_3.961.wav_ASR	and i'm afraid i don't always sing on key
84-2_496.23_1.816.wav_ASR	so i thought it might be good
84-2_498.25_2.78.wav_ASR	so i took some singing lessons which i still take
84-2_501.63_4.7.wav_ASR	and then also at temple there's an aphasia program
84-2_506.586_10.4.wav_ASR	and so there's a singing program there which i think i like better because i get real songs instead of made up songs at mcgee
84-2_517.118_19.5.wav_ASR	and we're on something called impact where we try to do stuff to help people learn about aphasia and see see how we can help other people who have aphasia
84-2_563.78_6.71.wav_ASR	well i have a lot of good experiences because i've had a pretty positive life
84-2_570.49_11.14.wav_ASR	up until first grade i went to school in a suburb of cleveland ohio called south euclid
84-2_582.166_13.72.wav_ASR	and then between my first and second grade years i moved to chicago and was in a really nice suburb there called winnetka
84-2_596.144_6.909.wav_ASR	and so growing up i i i i was participating in a lot of different things
84-2_603.184_3.92.wav_ASR	i was not a great athlete but i was an okay enough athlete
84-2_607.264_4.74.wav_ASR	so i'd usually make the last player on the team or the second last player on the team
84-2_612.29_4.45.wav_ASR	and i really liked playing hockey which we did outdoors at the time
84-2_617.81_12.14.wav_ASR	and so i would say i learned a lot of experience from hockey just just about the game and about you know how to set up different plays
84-2_630.86_17.583.wav_ASR	and eventually eventually when i was in my what's called the bantam league which is fourteen and fifteen i was made captain of the team
84-2_648.56_1.971.wav_ASR	so that was a really nice honor for me
84-2_650.531_4.636.wav_ASR	and it was a good time for me
84-2_655.371_2.836.wav_ASR	my my i was on the bl team i was not on the al team
84-2_658.411_5.549.wav_ASR	but but there's enough players on the bl team that i was pretty friendly with
84-2_664.191_1.68.wav_ASR	and all of them were from winnetka
84-2_666.031_2.66.wav_ASR	so it was winnetka and northfield
84-2_668.951_1.04.wav_ASR	it was a nearby suburb
84-2_670.145_2.671.wav_ASR	so it was really nice to meet all the people
84-2_673.365_10.54.wav_ASR	and we would have games basically from lake forest and from lake county to cook county
84-2_684.865_2.36.wav_ASR	so it was just nice to get to know some people
84-2_693.81_2.2.wav_ASR	i did get hurt while i was playing hockey
84-2_696.361_5.44.wav_ASR	i broke my collarbone
84-2_706.07_1.072.wav_ASR	it wasn't that bad
84-2_710.85_1.037.wav_ASR	can be
84-2_712.13_2.397.wav_ASR	but it wasn't bad for me
84-2_714.67_2.22.wav_ASR	maybe it wasn't a particularly bad break
84-2_717.63_4.6.wav_ASR	but i remember i came home and i still wasn't feeling great
84-2_722.231_11.86.wav_ASR	so my dad took me to what was then called evanston hospital which is now part of northwestern medical center from downtown
84-2_735.0_4.82.wav_ASR	and so i remember i did some xrays and some other things
84-2_740.071_1.66.wav_ASR	and they said i had a broken collarbone
84-2_741.98_7.66.wav_ASR	so you know i i think i i actually broke my collarbone
84-2_751.48_1.24.wav_ASR	maybe it was only once
84-2_753.1_1.699.wav_ASR	and then i also broke my wrist
84-2_755.56_1.969.wav_ASR	but i can't remember exactly how i did that
84-2_765.892_4.149.wav_ASR	yeah yeah yeah you you can't have a cast on that
84-2_776.028_1.013.wav_ASR	it can be yeah
84-2_777.152_1.08.wav_ASR	do you play any sports
84-2_781.243_1.08.wav_ASR	oh wow
84-2_785.063_2.76.wav_ASR	yeah yeah so did did you do that in college too
84-2_797.763_0.72.wav_ASR	well good
84-2_845.89_2.26.wav_ASR	oh yes that's the same thing we saw the last time
84-2_858.01_2.94.wav_ASR	so it's a story of a young man
84-2_861.0_5.48.wav_ASR	i would say he's around twelve years old kicking a soccer ball
84-2_867.26_13.14.wav_ASR	and i guess one of the errant kicks went through a plate glass window and landed next to someone who was probably either reading or maybe watching tv
84-2_880.69_3.33.wav_ASR	and so he saw the ball coming at him
84-2_884.43_10.34.wav_ASR	and he he noticed that a lamp had come to rest on beside him
84-2_895.09_3.248.wav_ASR	and he could he could see the ball coming at him
84-2_898.338_2.865.wav_ASR	so he might have caught the ball
84-2_902.03_2.001.wav_ASR	and then he wasn't sure what to do
84-2_904.138_2.02.wav_ASR	so he saw that the glass was broken
84-2_906.678_4.26.wav_ASR	so he went over to the window to see what had happened
84-2_911.418_4.592.wav_ASR	and i'm assuming that he saw the person who kicked the soccer ball
84-2_916.01_6.4.wav_ASR	but by then perhaps the person with the soccer ball had run away
84-2_930.177_7.24.wav_ASR	so it's the story of a young boy who was on his way to school
84-2_938.237_5.22.wav_ASR	and he wasn't sure that he needed umbrella
84-2_943.61_7.119.wav_ASR	so he decided that he wouldn't take an umbrella because it maybe didn't look like it was gonna rain
84-2_951.25_5.94.wav_ASR	but as soon as he stepped outside and started walking a little bit the rain came down
84-2_957.89_1.84.wav_ASR	so he went back to his house
84-2_959.73_4.444.wav_ASR	and he he was all wet
84-2_964.39_3.26.wav_ASR	and his mother had a stern look on her face
84-2_967.95_1.755.wav_ASR	but there was nothing he could do
84-2_969.89_4.927.wav_ASR	so he got some new clothes and went back out into the rain
84-2_975.35_1.92.wav_ASR	but this time he had an umbrella
84-2_988.79_6.25.wav_ASR	this is the picture of a young lady who had a cat stuck up in a tree
84-2_995.279_8.66.wav_ASR	so she she got off her tricycle and saw what must have been her dad
84-2_1004.61_2.312.wav_ASR	and her dad climbed up the tree
84-2_1007.139_3.56.wav_ASR	but then the ladder broke and fell to the ground
84-2_1011.04_7.14.wav_ASR	there is a a puppy who's trying to see if maybe the man or could come down
84-2_1018.34_18.709.wav_ASR	but he he was up there and needed to be rescued by the fire department who came over and was going to get the father down and perhaps i imagine also get the cat down
84-2_1188.82_0.522.wav_ASR	got ya
84-2_1190.29_11.04.wav_ASR	well so this is a story about cinderella and her two stepdaughters and her old mother
84-2_1202.87_5.93.wav_ASR	so i believe that cinderella needed some help
84-2_1208.85_10.08.wav_ASR	and since she was on her own she was able to get a job with the two stepsisters and the stepmother
84-2_1219.6_12.86.wav_ASR	and she was doing a lot of stuff like washing the clothes and cleaning the floors and doing stuff like that and probably also doing the laundry
84-2_1233.61_13.66.wav_ASR	and then it came to pass that there was a prince who lived in the castle with his father and mother and perhaps some sisters and brothers
84-2_1247.87_7.51.wav_ASR	and he he was looking for somebody to fall in love with
84-2_1255.91_10.09.wav_ASR	so they everybody in the town got an invitation to this big party that they were gonna have
84-2_1266.0_7.976.wav_ASR	so the two stepsisters dressed up in fine clothes and the mother went with them
84-2_1273.976_12.38.wav_ASR	and the prince was looking for someone
84-2_1286.996_3.0.wav_ASR	and so he he decided to have this party
84-2_1290.119_5.02.wav_ASR	and so they were at the party
84-2_1295.299_12.78.wav_ASR	and then a fairy godmother came along and said to the young woman cinderella that cinderella should go to the party too
84-2_1308.226_9.88.wav_ASR	so she she was able to get a dress and some nice clothing including a some beautiful shoes
84-2_1319.006_8.0.wav_ASR	and they they were in somehow invited to the ball
84-2_1327.231_10.9.wav_ASR	and they came to the ball in a special chariot which had a rider and someone who was in the back
84-2_1338.211_7.36.wav_ASR	and and they came out at the at the party
84-2_1345.673_6.279.wav_ASR	and the the the prince was there
84-2_1352.133_2.54.wav_ASR	and the prince saw cinderella
84-2_1355.293_3.02.wav_ASR	and they had a very good time
84-2_1358.335_10.88.wav_ASR	the the cinderella had been told that she needed to be home by midnight
84-2_1370.035_5.014.wav_ASR	so as the clock struck twelve she knew she hadta get out
84-2_1375.049_3.707.wav_ASR	so she left and left the prince there
84-2_1378.756_17.48.wav_ASR	and as she went out to the carriage the princess cinderella turned back to a like a servant
84-2_1396.299_11.02.wav_ASR	a and the prince prince was really upset about what had happened
84-2_1407.593_17.28.wav_ASR	so he he sent his some people from his castle to go out and see if they could find cinderella
84-2_1425.678_6.62.wav_ASR	and so he went he went to different houses and could not find anybody
84-2_1432.618_11.82.wav_ASR	when he went to the house where the two stepsisters lived he was wanting to know if anybody else was there
84-2_1444.93_13.02.wav_ASR	and somehow i think maybe he figured out that the young lady who was cinderella was in the other room
84-2_1458.25_1.72.wav_ASR	so he brought out cinderella
84-2_1460.57_2.92.wav_ASR	and the shoes fit
84-2_1463.42_8.56.wav_ASR	so he went back to the prince and told him about this person
84-2_1472.66_6.16.wav_ASR	and eventually the person became close again with the prince
84-2_1480.57_3.74.wav_ASR	and and and in the end the prince and cinderella got married
84-2_1514.01_3.94.wav_ASR	i don't remember what i talked about last week
84-2_1518.63_6.689.wav_ASR	so there was always a clock in my house growing up
84-2_1526.11_3.865.wav_ASR	and so i i knew pretty easily what time it was
84-2_1530.23_1.698.wav_ASR	oh i think i know the story
84-2_1531.9_8.72.wav_ASR	and so i remember especially in high school that there wasn't really any time i hadta be home
84-2_1541.12_5.3.wav_ASR	so my parents said that you know whenever you get home it's fine
84-2_1546.84_4.825.wav_ASR	you know obviously not too late but you know you you wanna have a good time
84-2_1551.665_5.02.wav_ASR	so especially on friday and saturday nights we useta go out
84-2_1556.735_4.043.wav_ASR	we useta drink beer in one of my friends' basement and then go out
84-2_1561.105_4.17.wav_ASR	and so we would go to different parties which was a lot of fun
84-2_1565.275_7.34.wav_ASR	but i always made it home except one time i actually fell asleep at the wheel
84-2_1573.075_7.54.wav_ASR	but i was driving
84-2_1580.922_5.48.wav_ASR	and one of my friends who was named firstnamet was in the other seat
84-2_1587.065_3.064.wav_ASR	and he he yelled at me
84-2_1590.202_0.83.wav_ASR	and i woke up
84-2_1591.802_1.28.wav_ASR	so it was at a stoplight
84-2_1593.302_0.94.wav_ASR	so nothing happened
84-2_1594.562_1.16.wav_ASR	but i was pretty lucky
84-2_1595.743_6.552.wav_ASR	so i guess it it's just good to know that a clock is always there knowing what time it is
84-2_1602.295_18.18.wav_ASR	and hopefully you know i i i then when i was in college i dated a couple different girls where i was from in in in winnetka kennelworth and in wilmette
84-2_1621.213_5.323.wav_ASR	and so i had a job that started at six o'clock in the morning during the summer
84-2_1626.636_8.781.wav_ASR	so i useta stay out with my friends or at my girlfriend's house until about four in the morning and then go go to work
84-2_1635.473_3.123.wav_ASR	or i would come home and get my bike and then go to work
84-2_1638.596_3.3.wav_ASR	so it was fun but it was also pretty exhausting
84-2_1661.747_12.78.wav_ASR	i think the only thing i can say about birds is that growing up i pretty much took birds for granted
84-2_1674.744_11.46.wav_ASR	and i remember even when i was in undergraduate i went to law school i i mean i never really thought about birds
84-2_1686.85_16.941.wav_ASR	well i i i guess i should say that i worked a lot in when i was a lawyer
84-2_1703.791_4.937.wav_ASR	and then i went to a company where i was for a long time
84-2_1709.271_8.12.wav_ASR	but now that i'm looking for stuff to do one of the things i'm pretty interested in doing is birdwatching
84-2_1718.071_2.377.wav_ASR	so it's something i'm gonna try to do
84-2_1720.448_13.26.wav_ASR	i i'm sure i told you but maybe i didn't that me and my wife are gonna move to south carolina and in a community there where i feel i can do some birdwatching
84-2_1734.128_1.611.wav_ASR	so i'd like to try it
84-2_1735.948_1.252.wav_ASR	i hope i'm good at it
84-2_1737.348_1.265.wav_ASR	i hope i know what i'm doing
84-2_1738.613_8.402.wav_ASR	but it's important for me to find some hobbies that i can work on and try to get feel feel good about it
84-2_1751.233_2.428.wav_ASR	oh we've already picked a place
84-2_1753.973_1.755.wav_ASR	it's called kiawah kiawah island
84-2_1755.813_0.848.wav_ASR	have you ever been there
84-2_1757.804_3.6.wav_ASR	it's off the coast of charleston
84-2_1763.495_4.149.wav_ASR	it's about forty minutes from the charleston airport
84-2_1768.604_1.36.wav_ASR	and it's a beautiful
84-2_1772.244_3.34.wav_ASR	well i don't wanna go into too much detail
84-2_1775.781_12.445.wav_ASR	but we we we are constructing a place there that's part of a condominium that's right on the beach
84-2_1788.901_5.343.wav_ASR	and so so i my wife is down there right now
84-2_1794.244_5.8.wav_ASR	so she could actually go into the building which is being constructed
84-2_1800.532_16.3.wav_ASR	and she was able to tell me that from where our condominium is placed my wife says that she can actually see the beach you know for the oceans
84-2_1817.192_13.006.wav_ASR	so for me that was really nice because my i useta have a place in oxford maryland which my wife really liked that i didn't like so much
84-2_1830.198_1.1.wav_ASR	it was right on the water
84-2_1831.912_4.94.wav_ASR	and so now i feel that i've been able to give something you know
84-2_1837.124_5.433.wav_ASR	some i've wanted to find a place that would be good for her
84-2_1843.004_3.038.wav_ASR	and i mean it's gonna be a little hot for me
84-2_1846.364_6.04.wav_ASR	but i think it's gonna be worth it because it's gonna be a great place for my wife
84-2_1861.804_4.88.wav_ASR	hilton head is it's in south carolina or north carolina
84-2_1868.964_0.303.wav_ASR	got ya
84-2_1877.712_1.04.wav_ASR	well it's pretty conservative
84-2_1879.112_1.64.wav_ASR	and i'm not very conservative so
84-2_1882.912_1.763.wav_ASR	but i think it should be good
84-2_1885.012_4.164.wav_ASR	and we know some people down there who live there
84-2_1889.212_1.86.wav_ASR	so that's gonna be really helpful too
84-2_1891.217_9.274.wav_ASR	but the the person i know really well made a fortune in in a company that he was in
84-2_1900.657_4.7.wav_ASR	so he has a lot of places now all over the world including kiawah
84-2_1929.085_7.92.wav_ASR	well i've stayed in some nice hotels
84-2_1937.925_5.3.wav_ASR	but probably the nicest hotel i stayed in was for my wedding
84-2_1943.216_11.64.wav_ASR	i married a a law student when i was in law school who lived in washington dc
84-2_1955.736_3.62.wav_ASR	so we got married at the four seasons hotel in georgetown
84-2_1960.256_1.29.wav_ASR	and that was a real nice place
84-2_1961.546_2.702.wav_ASR	we we were able to be there for a couple days
84-2_1964.566_2.56.wav_ASR	we had a fair amount of people at our wedding
84-2_1967.137_1.529.wav_ASR	i think it was about two hundred
84-2_1969.686_5.86.wav_ASR	and we were able to have a wedding on a sunday afternoon
84-2_1976.586_2.56.wav_ASR	and we had a nice lunch
84-2_1979.209_12.504.wav_ASR	and then i remember that many of my friends went down to a bar further down in georgetown and with my wife and some friends and had a nice evening there
84-2_1992.089_1.731.wav_ASR	so for me it was a good place
84-2_1994.369_2.18.wav_ASR	but truly i like being home
84-2_1996.549_3.359.wav_ASR	so i you know i did it
84-2_1999.989_0.545.wav_ASR	it was good
84-2_2000.709_3.348.wav_ASR	but you know i like being where i am now
84-2_2196.154_4.351.wav_ASR	well i think i told you about my favorite restaurant in new york right
84-2_2200.505_1.925.wav_ASR	the one that i went to for about twenty years
84-2_2204.4_1.8.wav_ASR	so i won't talk about that
84-2_2206.653_12.64.wav_ASR	well here in philadelphia i've gotten to know a few restaurants
84-2_2219.853_5.936.wav_ASR	because i lived here when i first took a job
84-2_2225.789_3.92.wav_ASR	i was a law clerk for a judge in philadelphia
84-2_2230.669_3.36.wav_ASR	and then i lived here for a while before i moved to princeton
84-2_2234.197_14.716.wav_ASR	but one of the places i like to eat a lot although it's gone up in price a little bit is a restaurant called parc parck which is how you spell parc in french
84-2_2249.537_1.139.wav_ASR	and i don't know if i told you
84-2_2250.676_4.494.wav_ASR	but i useta be able to speak french pretty well
84-2_2255.756_5.814.wav_ASR	and i like going there because they have a lot of good food
84-2_2262.196_5.2.wav_ASR	it's gotten to be overpriced like so many restaurants
84-2_2267.49_9.604.wav_ASR	but one thing i really like there is my my they have a hamburger that's really nice
84-2_2277.79_5.42.wav_ASR	and it's it can be cooked different ways
84-2_2283.415_9.06.wav_ASR	and i like my meat very very raw not completely cooked but cooked most of the way
84-2_2293.155_8.88.wav_ASR	and it's a really nice place to get a juicy burger and either a salad or some some french fries
84-2_2302.33_4.163.wav_ASR	if if but the french fries are usually for my wife
84-2_2307.01_2.4.wav_ASR	so i usually wind up getting a a salad
84-2_2309.77_7.26.wav_ASR	but sometimes she makes me order the french fries
84-2_2336.29_0.91.wav_ASR	oh we had this too
84-2_2337.64_6.1.wav_ASR	well the peanut butter and jelly sandwich for me is pretty easy to make
84-2_2344.78_4.14.wav_ASR	most of my bread is in the freezer
84-2_2349.56_2.46.wav_ASR	so i take out two pieces of bread
84-2_2352.03_13.906.wav_ASR	i like a particular kind of peanut butter that is made at costco which has nothing but peanuts in it
84-2_2365.936_10.164.wav_ASR	when i have a peanut butter jelly sandwich which lately has been occurring a little more frequently for some reason i don't know
84-2_2376.676_2.695.wav_ASR	and then i'll take just about any jelly
84-2_2379.371_10.336.wav_ASR	but i've found a jelly at wegmans that has three different types of fruit in it
84-2_2389.5_27.09.wav_ASR	and so i put that with the peanut butter on a bread that is a a type of wheat bread that i find to be very good
84-2_2416.69_4.042.wav_ASR	so i i'm i'm gonna have a sandwich a little later today
84-2_2420.83_1.92.wav_ASR	but i'm probably gonna have a turkey sandwich
84-2_2423.13_2.155.wav_ASR	but yeah i like peanut butter and jelly a lot
84-2_2425.63_8.46.wav_ASR	and i've got the sandwich down to a science
84-2_2440.382_15.965.wav_ASR	well we i think i may have told you that we used to live in an apartment that we owned across the hall
84-2_2456.416_4.325.wav_ASR	but we found somebody that we thought we could sell it to
84-2_2460.976_7.3.wav_ASR	and it turned out that he the two of them bought it at a price that i think was pretty good
84-2_2468.485_11.2.wav_ASR	so while we're waiting for the place to be built in kiawah we've moved across the hall where there's a rental unit
84-2_2479.5_13.0.wav_ASR	so and there's a washer and a dryer with the rental with all the
84-2_2493.08_0.68.wav_ASR	not the rooms
84-2_2494.18_4.5.wav_ASR	all the locations i guess you could say have a washer and a dryer
84-2_2499.03_7.61.wav_ASR	so usually there may be a couple pieces of clothes that may go to the dry cleaner
84-2_2506.81_8.7.wav_ASR	but for the most part i will open the washer
84-2_2516.541_5.6.wav_ASR	it's a washer that it operates from the side
84-2_2522.721_4.203.wav_ASR	so i put all the clothes in which is something i'm still able to do
84-2_2527.541_5.5.wav_ASR	and then i will turn on the washer
84-2_2533.721_1.86.wav_ASR	usually it's on a cold cycle
84-2_2535.923_4.6.wav_ASR	and once it starts moving a little bit i put in the detergent
84-2_2541.603_5.972.wav_ASR	and for some reason this this washer takes a long time
84-2_2548.263_2.18.wav_ASR	but in about an hour it's done
84-2_2550.963_2.58.wav_ASR	and the clothes have always come up pretty clean
84-2_2553.677_3.5.wav_ASR	so i then put them in the dryer
84-2_2558.157_3.06.wav_ASR	and that's about another forty five minutes
84-2_2561.777_10.454.wav_ASR	but usually within two hours the clothes come out and they're ready to be folded which for me takes a while because i only have the one hand
84-2_2572.231_6.68.wav_ASR	so what i've tried to do is just limit the stuff that goes in my closet
84-2_2579.691_1.311.wav_ASR	and firstnamel's on her own
84-2_2582.091_6.46.wav_ASR	yeah she she she her clothes get washed with mine but i can't really put them away
84-2_2588.911_1.977.wav_ASR	and she's got a lot more clothing than i do
84-2_2605.921_5.7.wav_ASR	well i i grew up with a lot of flowers
84-2_2612.441_6.897.wav_ASR	but somehow when i married firstnamel that was not one of the things that she was really interested in
84-2_2619.338_7.26.wav_ASR	so we we have a few not a lot of fake flowers around our apartment
84-2_2627.098_3.1.wav_ASR	but i had a birthday in march
84-2_2630.778_6.74.wav_ASR	and one of the people i've become very close with is a personal trainer named firstnameg
84-2_2637.618_7.84.wav_ASR	and so firstnameg's been with me now for about two and a half years
84-2_2645.678_7.36.wav_ASR	and she got a small plant for me that is the only living plant in this apartment
84-2_2654.178_0.9.wav_ASR	and for some reason
84-2_2655.359_3.54.wav_ASR	i i got it at the end of march
84-2_2661.499_3.353.wav_ASR	and for some reason the plant is still chugging along
84-2_2664.959_0.989.wav_ASR	it's doing pretty well
84-2_2666.159_8.647.wav_ASR	so i feel good that i can keep a plant now for four months
84-2_2681.403_5.463.wav_ASR	i think the biggest success is is that i don't hafta water it very often
84-2_2689.146_3.773.wav_ASR	i can show it to you but i don't know what it is
84-2_2692.919_6.577.wav_ASR	maybe at the end if we have enough time i'll see if i can see it
84-2_2699.679_5.76.wav_ASR	but it it i it's just hard for me to see because it's on the window over there
84-2_2707.71_1.15.wav_ASR	are you big on plants
84-2_2725.24_2.756.wav_ASR	well find the easy ones to start with
54-1_7.551_3.64.wav_ASR	you hear
54-1_21.615_0.5.wav_ASR	don't know
54-1_45.538_0.63.wav_ASR	alright
54-1_52.124_1.42.wav_ASR	same thing
54-1_54.165_0.92.wav_ASR	was good
54-1_58.042_0.47.wav_ASR	so
54-1_65.795_0.53.wav_ASR	oh yeah
54-1_67.255_0.52.wav_ASR	this morning
54-1_79.297_1.64.wav_ASR	heh whoa no
54-1_83.228_2.09.wav_ASR	i was think of going yeah
54-1_85.678_3.31.wav_ASR	well because well well
54-1_92.23_8.37.wav_ASR	i i don't know
54-1_100.647_2.22.wav_ASR	it's really
54-1_110.078_0.49.wav_ASR	maybe
54-1_120.106_2.56.wav_ASR	long long time
54-1_125.931_4.869.wav_ASR	yeah it's probably probably
54-1_139.082_1.38.wav_ASR	i was
54-1_150.834_1.17.wav_ASR	yeah it is
54-1_152.101_2.33.wav_ASR	well i was dead
54-1_154.706_1.61.wav_ASR	you know i was
54-1_157.025_0.34.wav_ASR	yeah

61-1_25.037_0.33.wav_ASR	yes
61-1_26.772_10.59.wav_ASR	first of all i i had a sensation
61-1_37.381_1.15.wav_ASR	i i couldn't speak
61-1_38.607_5.59.wav_ASR	and then all of a sudden i started speaking again
61-1_45.366_12.18.wav_ASR	and i was two two forty seven over ninety
61-1_58.751_15.99.wav_ASR	so i asked to see go to the ambulance and go to the the
61-1_76.25_3.64.wav_ASR	and when i got there he couldn't find anything wrong with me
61-1_80.439_7.66.wav_ASR	but he he thought thought he would put me in a place e
61-1_88.709_1.3.wav_ASR	and they put me in
61-1_90.349_3.38.wav_ASR	they hooked me up and did everything
61-1_95.155_1.83.wav_ASR	and i was doing fine
61-1_97.039_1.31.wav_ASR	i i felt fine
61-1_98.399_1.83.wav_ASR	i was talking fine
61-1_100.966_6.14.wav_ASR	and the doctor came in and was going to discharge me
61-1_107.936_1.9.wav_ASR	and i couldn't talk
61-1_111.68_0.89.wav_ASR	and so he goes
61-1_112.95_2.58.wav_ASR	i think you better stay
61-1_117.965_4.57.wav_ASR	and then i went
61-1_123.467_9.27.wav_ASR	and the nurse was sposta help me go to the restroom but she didn't
61-1_133.067_3.3.wav_ASR	and i went into the restroom
61-1_136.391_1.53.wav_ASR	and i stumbled and fell
61-1_140.685_3.91.wav_ASR	and they got me up
61-1_144.655_8.54.wav_ASR	and they took me down to do another head scan
61-1_154.705_13.28.wav_ASR	and then they hooked me up to a bird airplane and drove me up to methodist
61-1_169.781_4.37.wav_ASR	and then it gets kind of flaky
61-1_174.309_2.62.wav_ASR	i'm not real sure
61-1_178.661_5.2.wav_ASR	i wasn't performing much of anything
61-1_184.822_2.75.wav_ASR	and they kept me overnight
61-1_188.082_10.52.wav_ASR	and the next day i woke up and i i i could mostly talk but not very well
61-1_200.408_8.51.wav_ASR	and i started having all kinds of trouble
61-1_226.007_5.97.wav_ASR	well i i was in rehab for four or five weeks
61-1_233.191_11.69.wav_ASR	and i finally got to the point where i could you know walk with my walker
61-1_245.707_15.99.wav_ASR	and i could speak more terms and you know help me do better
61-1_262.172_3.67.wav_ASR	i didn't have any movement of my arm
61-1_266.267_3.84.wav_ASR	then i went home
61-1_315.699_2.93.wav_ASR	and i did that for a a year
61-1_330.479_11.46.wav_ASR	yeah i i i work with
61-1_349.383_4.85.wav_ASR	well she would help me with my walking and my arm
61-1_356.687_5.12.wav_ASR	so she worked one day a week with me on all of those
61-1_362.665_17.62.wav_ASR	and then i had three exercises that i did with my legs and my arms and my you know
61-1_380.9_21.52.wav_ASR	i didn't do anymore speech mainly because the speech was gonna cost money
61-1_404.089_2.27.wav_ASR	and i don't have money
61-1_435.895_8.56.wav_ASR	i went to butler for physician assistant
61-1_445.985_13.32.wav_ASR	and i i felt really good about it because when i i was out i could take care of people
61-1_461.683_4.17.wav_ASR	and i worked at camp atterbury
61-1_467.67_6.41.wav_ASR	and i we had a lot of people go through there

61-1_528.141_1.88.wav_ASR	and he kicked it
61-1_530.607_1.18.wav_ASR	and it hit the window
61-1_533.027_1.13.wav_ASR	and it came through
61-1_535.235_9.91.wav_ASR	and the guy was got up and looked out the window to see what caused the problem
61-1_576.326_1.63.wav_ASR	the mother says
61-1_578.502_0.9.wav_ASR	it's gonna rain
61-1_580.406_8.01.wav_ASR	and i'm gonna give you a umbrella
61-1_588.979_0.31.wav_ASR	and he said
61-1_589.931_1.01.wav_ASR	no i don't want it
61-1_592.076_3.31.wav_ASR	and so he walked and he walked

61-1_599.072_1.87.wav_ASR	and he was all drenched
61-1_601.589_1.22.wav_ASR	and his mom said
61-1_603.285_1.59.wav_ASR	you should've taken the umbrella
61-1_606.37_4.87.wav_ASR	and then so he took the umbrella and carried it out in the rain
61-1_632.32_7.8.wav_ASR	well there was a cat that was up in tree
61-1_640.874_3.84.wav_ASR	and so the guy got up there to try to help get the cat down
61-1_645.588_4.39.wav_ASR	there was a girl underneath trying to catch the cat
61-1_651.054_4.93.wav_ASR	and then they called for the firetruck

63-1_392.33_9.53.wav_ASR	and i needed to take the ladder up to the man so he could get down
63-1_402.248_11.88.wav_ASR	but he was couldn't get up because the dog was growling on him
63-1_414.71_2.09.wav_ASR	so i got some firemen
63-1_416.822_3.82.wav_ASR	and he he got up there
63-1_421.431_4.55.wav_ASR	and on his way to the ground he saw a wren
63-1_425.998_2.87.wav_ASR	and that was it
63-1_965.553_24.44.wav_ASR	cinderella cinderella was introduced by her two sisters and her mother and by
63-1_990.015_24.73.wav_ASR	and they told her she she couldn't go to the castle
63-1_1017.014_15.52.wav_ASR	but but cinderella had a fairy godmother who who got her all dressed up and sent her to the ball
63-1_1032.558_7.14.wav_ASR	and at midnight she hadta go
63-1_1043.301_2.52.wav_ASR	and she lost her slipper
63-1_1045.915_8.16.wav_ASR	and so everyone was wondering about the slipper
63-1_1055.11_1.24.wav_ASR	but she only had one
63-1_1056.449_6.94.wav_ASR	and then the count came and said he had the other slipper
63-1_1063.516_1.95.wav_ASR	and he took it from her
63-1_1065.485_2.85.wav_ASR	and it was her slipper
63-1_1069.277_5.73.wav_ASR	and so cinderella and the prince lived happily ever after
63-1_1076.923_0.77.wav_ASR	something like that
63-1_1089.922_3.5.wav_ASR	i get two pieces of bread
63-1_1094.826_14.33.wav_ASR	i put jelly on one slice and peanut butter on the other
63-1_1109.178_2.18.wav_ASR	and i put it together and eat them
63-2_8.939_3.81.wav_ASR	my speech is oka
63-2_12.805_5.82.wav_ASR	but a lot of times i i i know what it is but i can't say it
63-2_20.929_0.67.wav_ASR	that's what it is
63-2_21.647_1.36.wav_ASR	i i know what it is
63-2_23.054_4.5.wav_ASR	and until someone tells me what it is i just can't say it
63-2_27.999_0.71.wav_ASR	i don't know why
63-2_28.733_2.26.wav_ASR	but it's the way it is now
63-2_38.859_0.35.wav_ASR	yeah
63-2_44.303_3.08.wav_ASR	well i got up in the morning
63-2_48.081_2.82.wav_ASR	and right away i i i i rolled over
63-2_51.772_2.14.wav_ASR	she she was by my side
63-2_54.63_3.83.wav_ASR	and i told her i felt a little queasy
63-2_59.076_3.32.wav_ASR	and she didn't say much about it
63-2_62.957_13.02.wav_ASR	so then i i i i i i i went to the bathroom and did my thing
63-2_76.575_5.33.wav_ASR	and then right after i did my thing something happened in here
63-2_83.156_2.36.wav_ASR	and i said
63-2_86.28_0.56.wav_ASR	oh no
63-2_87.247_4.1.wav_ASR	and that's the last thing i remember for weeks
63-2_110.622_8.52.wav_ASR	well the the last thing i knew before my stroke hit was
63-2_119.546_6.29.wav_ASR	well after my stroke hit i i woke up
63-2_125.884_5.95.wav_ASR	well i i remember this was amsterdam new york
63-2_131.943_3.96.wav_ASR	so the next thing i know i'm back in wichita
63-2_137.638_4.23.wav_ASR	and i'm i'm on a bed
63-2_141.886_3.02.wav_ASR	my wife's there
63-2_145.895_8.26.wav_ASR	and and i i slowly start talking to her
63-2_154.83_6.86.wav_ASR	but at at the first thing i don't think i made much sense to her
63-2_161.771_2.36.wav_ASR	but she was always there for me
63-2_166.318_5.94.wav_ASR	so it it it you know it was okay because i i could tell her anything i wanted
63-2_172.567_0.74.wav_ASR	she'd listen
63-2_174.287_2.43.wav_ASR	did whatever she could
63-2_179.54_8.31.wav_ASR	and then after awhile two or three nurses would come in everyday
63-2_187.899_9.62.wav_ASR	and they would do crazy things like lift my legs and lift my back
63-2_197.735_3.12.wav_ASR	and every day it was something different
63-2_200.878_1.4.wav_ASR	and i would go down the hall
63-2_203.68_13.15.wav_ASR	and they would do leg lifts trying to get me whatever
63-2_216.852_3.61.wav_ASR	and i i would do do stairs
63-2_220.72_2.27.wav_ASR	i remember that i did stairs
63-2_223.735_6.54.wav_ASR	did a lot of i don't know
63-2_231.307_0.98.wav_ASR	then i don't know
63-2_232.337_1.88.wav_ASR	there was always somebody there
63-2_234.266_4.36.wav_ASR	there was always always somebody doing something to me
63-2_238.866_2.82.wav_ASR	a lot of it i don't know anymore
63-2_241.734_6.07.wav_ASR	but it for the first couple weeks i it was very extensive
63-2_270.707_16.25.wav_ASR	well the the best thing i can remember before my stroke was getting married of course
63-2_287.802_2.96.wav_ASR	and i was in the service at the time
63-2_290.815_10.36.wav_ASR	we we before i was a privacy officer i was also in the airforce for twenty two years
63-2_302.963_14.46.wav_ASR	so other from that i think the thing that i i do the most about in in in helenikon greece
63-2_318.711_10.5.wav_ASR	i i was very interested in basketball and baseball and and especially football
63-2_330.401_3.01.wav_ASR	had a lot of good memories about football
63-2_335.59_16.4.wav_ASR	yeah i i i i i'm not a blowing my own horn but after the season i was the best player defensively on the team
63-2_352.759_1.93.wav_ASR	i had a lot of interceptions
63-2_356.795_1.32.wav_ASR	a lot of things happened
63-2_358.702_5.14.wav_ASR	but there's a a a lot of things
63-2_363.887_3.23.wav_ASR	oh there there's so much i i
63-2_367.253_10.28.wav_ASR	in fact you know there's so many things good and bad that have happened to me
63-2_377.551_2.11.wav_ASR	i i i can't do anything
63-2_379.803_3.54.wav_ASR	in fact there's a lot of them i don't even remember anymore
63-2_384.569_2.54.wav_ASR	they're either trivial or whatever
63-2_387.736_1.31.wav_ASR	but that's the way it is
63-2_411.303_0.58.wav_ASR	okay
63-2_413.03_4.45.wav_ASR	there there was a boy who kicked the ball
63-2_417.912_3.64.wav_ASR	and the ball went into a glass window
63-2_422.674_15.1.wav_ASR	and when when it went into the window and it hit the guy on the chair and and knocked over the lamp
63-2_438.726_2.45.wav_ASR	and so he he grabbed the ball
63-2_442.108_7.4.wav_ASR	and he he told him he wasn't getting it back til the lamp was fixed
63-2_481.005_0.36.wav_ASR	okay
63-2_481.732_8.03.wav_ASR	first of all the boy did not want to take an umbrella
63-2_491.361_5.2.wav_ASR	he he he he said it was okay that he didn't have it
63-2_497.241_6.7.wav_ASR	so he he he walked out to in the rain and saw it was raining
63-2_504.464_2.37.wav_ASR	so he he hadta go back home
63-2_508.083_4.21.wav_ASR	and he was all wet now
63-2_512.317_9.689.wav_ASR	and so he he had had hadta get his umbrella
63-2_522.629_3.17.wav_ASR	and he put it in in his hand
63-2_525.853_3.21.wav_ASR	and he went to school with it
63-2_544.992_0.48.wav_ASR	okay
63-2_557.835_3.71.wav_ASR	first of all i see a little girl
63-2_561.562_1.48.wav_ASR	and she's trying to get a cat
63-2_564.448_3.49.wav_ASR	but her her her ladder broke
63-2_568.152_0.97.wav_ASR	so she couldn't get it
63-2_569.138_10.13.wav_ASR	so she she went to her father father who couldn't get it either because the the the ladder was gone
63-2_579.979_9.18.wav_ASR	and he had a dog
63-2_589.176_4.92.wav_ASR	and had a dog
63-2_594.116_4.12.wav_ASR	and up up the tree trying to get him
63-2_599.141_4.71.wav_ASR	and so because she couldn't get him
63-2_603.984_1.24.wav_ASR	and she couldn't get the cat
63-2_606.497_1.25.wav_ASR	she couldn't get the dog
63-2_608.377_9.35.wav_ASR	she went with the firemen who got her out and got everything back to normal
63-2_1440.511_0.74.wav_ASR	okay
63-2_1441.268_16.0.wav_ASR	when the stepmother and her two daughters were small they brought in cinderella to to clean up the house
63-2_1458.806_6.78.wav_ASR	and cinderella did all the work
63-2_1466.686_10.03.wav_ASR	and as kids got older there were more things for cinderella to do that that they wouldn't do
63-2_1478.756_14.77.wav_ASR	and finally they they got an invitation from the prince that there was gonna be a gala at the prince's palace
63-2_1495.182_6.21.wav_ASR	and they they told her she couldn't go because she she wasn't invited
63-2_1501.414_1.13.wav_ASR	and only they went
63-2_1503.72_13.93.wav_ASR	so after they were gone the fairy godmother showed up and and showed them how she could do it
63-2_1518.63_15.49.wav_ASR	and so the first thing the fairy godmother did was turn all the mice and everything into into the carriage and the horse and all
63-2_1535.312_12.67.wav_ASR	and then then cinderella was was given a fine dress to wear
63-2_1549.523_20.5.wav_ASR	and then when she got to the ball the prince could see nothing but cinderella
63-2_1571.01_3.63.wav_ASR	and they danced the night away
63-2_1575.707_4.89.wav_ASR	and then at twelve o'clock she said she hadta go
63-2_1580.617_5.67.wav_ASR	and while she was going one of her slippers was left on the ground
63-2_1586.306_15.28.wav_ASR	so when she got home cinderella was back in her shabby clothes and with the dogs and cats and everything
63-2_1601.634_26.69.wav_ASR	and then the the the shoe was supposed to be broken by by by the ugly mother
63-2_1629.078_3.66.wav_ASR	but they they it it wasn't
63-2_1632.753_6.42.wav_ASR	and so cinderella put on the shoe
63-2_1639.194_4.61.wav_ASR	and it was an exact match of the other other one
63-2_1644.445_0.98.wav_ASR	so he knew it was her
63-2_1646.792_3.37.wav_ASR	and so her and the prince got married
63-2_1650.177_1.77.wav_ASR	and they lived happily ever after
63-2_1666.397_8.74.wav_ASR	you put two slices of bread together
63-2_1675.69_2.37.wav_ASR	one with peanut butter and one with jelly
63-2_1678.161_2.74.wav_ASR	and you get them together
63-2_1680.917_3.87.wav_ASR	you got a peanut butter jelly sandwich
65-1_9.517_0.96.wav_ASR	seems to be adequat
65-1_28.81_2.53.wav_ASR	the eighty four incident last i remember is five days before that
65-1_35.471_0.49.wav_ASR	let's see
65-1_36.531_2.9.wav_ASR	it happened on a thursday march the eighth of eight four
65-1_40.334_5.76.wav_ASR	i remember we were at some friends' house having supper the previous saturday night
65-1_46.238_15.54.wav_ASR	and i remember nothing nothing after that until until until after outta i c u and started started remembering things slowly about three days after i was moved out of i c u
65-1_63.223_3.95.wav_ASR	and nineteen ninety
65-1_67.496_0.83.wav_ASR	let's see the
65-1_69.041_4.34.wav_ASR	i was crossing tenth street indianapolis
65-1_74.421_2.67.wav_ASR	and i remember crossing in the pedestrian crosswalk
65-1_77.109_7.56.wav_ASR	crossing with the light and seeing getting up close in the quarter panel on the car going from west to east
65-1_86.021_1.74.wav_ASR	and then i have the sensation being spun around
65-1_87.783_6.82.wav_ASR	that's the last thing i remember for probably i don't know twenty twenty minutes or so
65-1_104.608_1.57.wav_ASR	one eighty four accident
65-1_107.092_0.66.wav_ASR	one eighty four accident
65-1_107.8_10.32.wav_ASR	that was really troubling because didn't know where i was
65-1_119.162_6.17.wav_ASR	and there were visitors in in my hospital room
65-1_125.543_3.84.wav_ASR	and these guys were saying the the the visit
65-1_129.431_3.17.wav_ASR	i i knew who they were knew knew these these people
65-1_132.616_1.52.wav_ASR	but there's a lots lots of them there
65-1_134.184_1.5.wav_ASR	i didn't know where i was
65-1_136.291_2.12.wav_ASR	there were several people visiting me
65-1_138.802_1.63.wav_ASR	and and there several of them asked
65-1_141.127_1.76.wav_ASR	well when when is his voice gonna come back
65-1_143.169_1.03.wav_ASR	when is his voice gonna come back
65-1_145.808_1.58.wav_ASR	i thought was perfectly fine
65-1_148.727_11.07.wav_ASR	and but what i didn't know was that the i'd spent ten days with a breathing tube poked down my throat in a coma
65-1_160.403_2.47.wav_ASR	and and it looked like i wasn't gonna come out anytime soon
65-1_162.888_1.7.wav_ASR	they gave me a tracheotomy
65-1_165.547_13.33.wav_ASR	and i the what turned out to be scar tissue on the vocal cords changed my voice pretty radically where where my wife had had told me
65-1_178.901_7.83.wav_ASR	she said that you you you had the
65-1_190.21_0.31.wav_ASR	so i said
65-1_190.701_1.11.wav_ASR	actually there it was
65-1_191.914_1.46.wav_ASR	the one thing she liked about me
65-1_193.584_0.55.wav_ASR	and that was gone
65-1_194.184_7.67.wav_ASR	so but that was extraordinarily troubling because i i like i said didn't know where i was
65-1_202.556_3.45.wav_ASR	my and people i recognize it's recognize saying
65-1_206.835_1.36.wav_ASR	when does voice gonna come back
65-1_208.855_1.99.wav_ASR	and it was really really troubling to me
65-1_211.097_0.7.wav_ASR	really troubling
65-1_214.441_2.34.wav_ASR	that was one of the first of my memories
65-1_227.068_4.71.wav_ASR	well it's what what it ended up being was that the the
65-1_232.093_9.72.wav_ASR	in terms of my brain injury if you will certain things kinda stand out and were extraordinarily troubling
65-1_242.008_14.18.wav_ASR	and you know just when when when i happen to get get focus on something i didn't particularly understand or or or approve of it it didn't show up
65-1_256.236_2.98.wav_ASR	but it was extraordinarily angry
65-1_261.478_2.001.wav_ASR	and did did never did lash out
65-1_264.808_2.63.wav_ASR	but just but real really angry
65-1_267.486_1.47.wav_ASR	and and i kept it all internal
65-1_268.978_5.53.wav_ASR	it was very very very troubling really troubling for for quite a while
65-1_291.425_2.81.wav_ASR	and and and and i don't want you to ever to relate to that
65-1_294.408_3.91.wav_ASR	i wouldn't wouldn't wish that on anybody
65-1_316.655_7.65.wav_ASR	the almost nine nineteen ninety was almost a what
65-1_324.396_0.55.wav_ASR	again
65-1_325.376_0.84.wav_ASR	that's always say
65-1_326.232_3.43.wav_ASR	it was like just a rerun but not nearly as severe
65-1_330.55_12.55.wav_ASR	but the the eighty four incident was was was most interesting because because an engineer for my the company that i was employed by
65-1_343.181_6.64.wav_ASR	i was on what they call the highpotnn or high potential list meaning i had a wonderful career ahead of me
65-1_349.842_1.58.wav_ASR	was gonna go far in the organization
65-1_352.182_4.66.wav_ASR	and and and my one of my supervisors told me
65-1_356.862_0.89.wav_ASR	and he wasn't supposed to do this
65-1_357.802_6.2.wav_ASR	told me i was on the highpotnn list which meant again i was going far
65-1_364.136_1.18.wav_ASR	my career was laid out in front of me
65-1_366.048_2.15.wav_ASR	there was nothing stopping me
65-1_369.12_8.58.wav_ASR	and then after the eighty four incident a personality change which i find out twenty years later is endemic ptsdn
65-1_377.717_1.63.wav_ASR	which i find out twenty years later is endemic
65-1_380.151_3.17.wav_ASR	and and i sound different
65-1_384.141_2.67.wav_ASR	i was slower to comprehend things
65-1_387.869_5.87.wav_ASR	but finally did after bit taking taking more time would comprehend things
65-1_393.757_7.06.wav_ASR	and and and and i couldn't do my engineering job to to to suit me
65-1_401.669_1.51.wav_ASR	and i didn't didn't tell anybody that
65-1_403.668_0.89.wav_ASR	i didn't tell anybody that
65-1_404.612_0.8.wav_ASR	tried i faked it
65-1_406.295_17.87.wav_ASR	i faked it and spent my lunch hours for months i was by myself in a conference room relearning aspects of my job and not telling a soul because i just knew
65-1_424.226_1.26.wav_ASR	this was before before eighty eight
65-1_426.413_1.47.wav_ASR	nineteen eighty four again
65-1_428.188_2.09.wav_ASR	actually before the american of disabilities act
65-1_430.428_0.54.wav_ASR	eighty eight
65-1_432.046_2.46.wav_ASR	and and i was on on the accident in eighty four
65-1_434.528_1.11.wav_ASR	i was on company business
65-1_436.8_5.82.wav_ASR	and i i just knew that that not be able to comprehend basic aspects of my job
65-1_443.288_1.95.wav_ASR	actually i just knew i was gonna get fired
65-1_445.562_0.85.wav_ASR	i knew i was
65-1_447.165_8.14.wav_ASR	had three kids a wife and spouse just a lovely lovely lovely lovely woman there at home with the three kids
65-1_455.32_2.19.wav_ASR	and i was the income
65-1_458.431_2.45.wav_ASR	and i couldn't stand the thought of being fired
65-1_461.855_5.49.wav_ASR	and and so like i say i did everything i could to relearn my job
65-1_467.981_7.74.wav_ASR	and but it did take me probably a couple three years to figure out that that i was no longer on on the fast track
65-1_476.146_1.08.wav_ASR	no no no longer
65-1_477.247_2.36.wav_ASR	it wasn't obvious at first
65-1_479.684_3.22.wav_ASR	but i i was no longer on the fast track
65-1_482.928_9.4.wav_ASR	and and and the biggest most difficult part of that was just short term memory difficulties
65-1_493.261_11.8.wav_ASR	and so i ended up with a franklin planner and would write down everything in there just to help my short term memory
65-1_506.11_10.319.wav_ASR	so it was largely the the aphasia and and people seeing me differently at work
65-1_516.482_4.701.wav_ASR	and of course i look back on it a few years after that
65-1_521.2_2.859.wav_ASR	and and i did not deserve a to be on the fast track
65-1_524.107_3.97.wav_ASR	i it it it it was perfectly obvious to everybody around me
65-1_528.092_0.72.wav_ASR	but it wasn't obvious to me
65-1_530.176_14.41.wav_ASR	and that the writing everything down was was the biggest biggest assistant assistant assistance to me that helped helped me do my job
65-1_567.07_6.54.wav_ASR	the basically it was being the the the
65-1_573.891_4.62.wav_ASR	i i i call it pre eighty four accident post eighty four accident
65-1_579.419_5.17.wav_ASR	that's that's how my my my life has been defined
65-1_585.51_11.37.wav_ASR	and i it's it that that that is what i call my my my defining moment the the the the defining event
65-1_597.64_8.89.wav_ASR	because i've struggled with the the aphasia obviously and memory issues ever since then
65-1_606.552_13.22.wav_ASR	and and and and i mean for example the the the winter of seventy six seventy seven i was out of engineering school at purdue
65-1_619.826_1.84.wav_ASR	had a job in indianapolis
65-1_621.855_7.67.wav_ASR	and so the as economic viability i i i paid rent to my folks lived in their house
65-1_630.113_6.18.wav_ASR	and that winter my dad and i put an oldmobile vl eight in a chevrolet vega a little small car
65-1_637.015_3.44.wav_ASR	and it was quite an interesting interesting project
65-1_641.315_4.08.wav_ASR	and and interestingly enough i can probably
65-1_645.41_8.3.wav_ASR	the the the engine had a rochester four gl cl carburetor on it which had some difficulties
65-1_653.791_1.8.wav_ASR	and i could probably still today
65-1_655.869_1.58.wav_ASR	now this was nineteen seventy six seventy seven
65-1_658.288_2.76.wav_ASR	i could probably still today rebuild that carburetor blindfolded
65-1_662.6_3.89.wav_ASR	and but but but ask me what i had for supper last night
65-1_667.122_0.49.wav_ASR	can't tell ya
65-1_669.274_0.66.wav_ASR	so yup
65-1_670.235_1.4.wav_ASR	short short term memory issues
65-1_671.658_13.02.wav_ASR	but but then things from from from long ago and do do do do something long ago i i can reconstruct like it was yesterday
65-1_695.671_5.07.wav_ASR	no i ended up actually at purdue mechanical engineering
65-1_701.591_4.64.wav_ASR	and and i got out of school the spring of seventy six
65-1_706.317_1.95.wav_ASR	had a job at a company named shwitzer
65-1_709.739_0.87.wav_ASR	they're in indianapolis
65-1_710.687_2.65.wav_ASR	and shwitzer no longer exists
65-1_714.262_5.09.wav_ASR	but i was in engine cooling engineering at at with shwitzer
65-1_720.011_10.31.wav_ASR	and so so i my my customers for engine cooling fans for shwitzer were ford light truck ford heavy truck
65-1_731.149_9.58.wav_ASR	one of the small ford pats cars had a cadillac excuse me pontiac
65-1_745.046_7.51.wav_ASR	and the chevrolet abfatyk cars that was all my cooling fan customers
65-1_753.154_4.14.wav_ASR	so i was already doing that kind of stuff as as a job
65-1_758.166_6.91.wav_ASR	but then my my father found this this article on engine conversion on the chevrolet vega
65-1_765.797_12.68.wav_ASR	and there just happened to be that it was a project where he and i to to to build together that winter while while while i was working the automotive industry's field
65-1_778.497_8.96.wav_ASR	and and it it it's kinda how i gravitated
65-1_815.779_2.14.wav_ASR	well it was a real sleeper
65-1_818.492_4.39.wav_ASR	meaning that the the hot car at the time was the the datsun two forty zl
65-1_823.884_3.99.wav_ASR	it was the first of the datsun zl cars
65-1_828.597_6.2.wav_ASR	and and i useta from a stoplight dust those guys off
65-1_835.141_6.83.wav_ASR	they the the other guys the drivers of datsun's zl cars couldn't figure out how in the hell this vega beat the shit out of them
65-1_842.229_5.21.wav_ASR	it was a lot of fun seeing looks in their faces in my rearview mirror
65-1_910.099_1.2.wav_ASR	okay
65-1_911.875_2.36.wav_ASR	this story is there's a a a young lad
65-1_914.589_8.46.wav_ASR	looks like maybe maybe teenager like a sixth grader or seventh grader kicking a soccer ball
65-1_923.492_6.72.wav_ASR	and here it kick puts the soccer ball through a a house's window
65-1_930.915_8.97.wav_ASR	and the soccer ball comes through the house's window and and lands a on a an adult male male's lap in the house
65-1_940.813_7.32.wav_ASR	and the adult male gets up holding the soccer ball and looks through the hole in the window trying to figure out what's going on
65-1_951.714_0.38.wav_ASR	and done
65-1_971.063_5.65.wav_ASR	looks like a a a a young boy is leaving
65-1_976.736_2.88.wav_ASR	and his his we're gonna say it was mother says
65-1_979.897_1.4.wav_ASR	here's here's your umbrella
65-1_981.983_0.84.wav_ASR	and he says
65-1_983.049_1.03.wav_ASR	no i don't need that
65-1_984.13_4.77.wav_ASR	and then then he he he he leaves saying goodbye and everything
65-1_989.831_1.61.wav_ASR	and the mom holding the umbrella
65-1_991.969_3.23.wav_ASR	and the the the young lad is out and about walking around
65-1_995.914_1.2.wav_ASR	and it starts to rain
65-1_997.78_1.36.wav_ASR	then it starts to rain heavier
65-1_999.75_0.79.wav_ASR	and he's running
65-1_1000.563_4.18.wav_ASR	and he gets back to his mom so soaking wet
65-1_1005.358_0.87.wav_ASR	and he's not happy
65-1_1006.245_1.13.wav_ASR	nor neither is she happy
65-1_1008.212_2.37.wav_ASR	and then he goes out finally with an umbrella
65-1_1010.631_3.09.wav_ASR	and and and it looks like all is well
65-1_1027.309_5.9.wav_ASR	well the beginning it looks like a pet cat had climbed up a tree
65-1_1034.269_3.46.wav_ASR	and being probably chased by a dog climbed up a tree
65-1_1038.222_1.16.wav_ASR	got stuck up in the tree
65-1_1040.013_8.761.wav_ASR	a little girl who was probably her owner rode over there on her tricycle and and wants her cat down
65-1_1049.333_10.48.wav_ASR	and looks like an adult male figure most likely her dad had climbed up the tree to get the cat and is caught up there by this barking dog
65-1_1060.56_5.52.wav_ASR	also and now then there's also a a a bird on the other side of this tree singing away
65-1_1066.533_11.02.wav_ASR	and there's also the local fire department is showing up with their ladder to try and get down both the the cat and the the male figure
65-1_1077.577_2.22.wav_ASR	there's that's that's a tree by the dog
65-1_1353.355_0.3.wav_ASR	thank you
65-1_1353.835_5.45.wav_ASR	cinderella was her mother passed away
65-1_1360.127_2.77.wav_ASR	father remarried
65-1_1363.72_8.84.wav_ASR	and the there's the the wicked stepmother had brought with her two two rather mean spirited daughters
65-1_1373.655_13.75.wav_ASR	and and in their home life the cinderella was treated poorly by the stepmothers and abused which i always say by the stepdaughters
65-1_1387.769_7.59.wav_ASR	and and so just just worked worked a lot
65-1_1395.968_9.9.wav_ASR	and then in the kingdom the king had a a a unmarried son
65-1_1406.524_19.39.wav_ASR	and in the kingdom with the the intent of getting the the prince married off
65-1_1427.134_24.41.wav_ASR	and so cinderella with the help of of the mice and there in the house they sewed up a a really lovely gown for cinderella to wear wear wear to this ball
65-1_1451.694_17.08.wav_ASR	and and the the stepmother was intent on getting one of her her her her daughters married off and and then so would not allow cinderella to go to the ball
65-1_1469.504_3.98.wav_ASR	her stepsisters went
65-1_1474.182_11.98.wav_ASR	and a a carriage which looked like a a pumpkin and then mice who ended up turned into horses
65-1_1486.874_8.89.wav_ASR	and i think that the the horse from the house ended up as the the driver of the pumpkin carriage
65-1_1496.594_3.35.wav_ASR	and she she she ended up going to the ball
65-1_1499.966_5.76.wav_ASR	also the the the prince danced the night away with cinderella
65-1_1506.4_12.64.wav_ASR	and but the stipulation from the cinderella's fairy godmother was you hadta be back by midnight because everything was gonna go back to the way it was at midnight
65-1_1519.217_1.04.wav_ASR	so it was late
65-1_1520.273_3.71.wav_ASR	so she hurried out of there and left a glass slipper behind
65-1_1524.602_11.17.wav_ASR	and then after the the ball was over the the the the prince said there was only only one person interested in
65-1_1535.789_2.93.wav_ASR	it was the the gal that left the glass slipper behind
65-1_1538.769_9.72.wav_ASR	and and so the the advisor was sent throughout the kingdom to try and figure out who was that that lady who left the glass slipper behind
65-1_1549.451_11.43.wav_ASR	and and it was the the lady whose whose foot would fit this the small glass slipper
65-1_1561.723_3.47.wav_ASR	and the stepsisters neither one of them would fit the glass slipper
65-1_1565.701_3.72.wav_ASR	cinderella's foot would fit in the slipper
65-1_1569.443_7.35.wav_ASR	and so she was identified as the one that the prince wanted to marry
65-1_1576.915_5.67.wav_ASR	so then the the the cinderella married the prince
65-1_1582.609_2.0.wav_ASR	and they lived happily ever after
65-1_1595.381_4.76.wav_ASR	oh prefer preferably on on a wheat bread
65-1_1600.8_8.05.wav_ASR	you would use a knife and and spread the peanut butter on one side of the bread
65-1_1609.79_6.11.wav_ASR	aha but then the on the other other side of the other other other bread the optimal jelly is grape jelly
65-1_1617.339_1.5.wav_ASR	so you take a spoon
65-1_1619.081_5.76.wav_ASR	not not knife because you cut up the the the the jelly and the jar
65-1_1624.893_6.9.wav_ASR	but but you take your spoon and and spoon out the the the grape jelly on the other piece of bread
65-1_1632.163_2.41.wav_ASR	use the knife to spread it out
65-1_1634.597_2.32.wav_ASR	then then put the two halves together
65-1_1636.935_3.5.wav_ASR	and you got the ultimate peanut butter and jelly sandwich
65-2_8.167_1.85.wav_ASR	speech is adequat
65-2_10.563_0.77.wav_ASR	much improved
65-2_12.338_9.08.wav_ASR	the the halting of of speech searching for words occurs less than it did
65-2_22.185_23.08.wav_ASR	the what what happens is that the if i have an occasion to tell a story or something like that i will may do it in the most base form and and and think later
65-2_45.514_1.3.wav_ASR	well i i shoulda said this
65-2_46.935_0.67.wav_ASR	i coulda said that
65-2_48.111_1.09.wav_ASR	why why didn't i say that
65-2_49.95_6.53.wav_ASR	for example in the troubleshooting automotive electronics there's some difficulty with a car
65-2_57.16_5.08.wav_ASR	it helps immensely if i think about it for about a day or so
65-2_62.323_26.47.wav_ASR	unless i've seen it before the the the the the length of time spent analyzing and thinking about it and considering all the different aspects of the problem technically technically electronically or mechanically time is of the most assistance
65-2_89.557_8.62.wav_ASR	and well i'll after i had a wrong ideas
65-2_98.79_1.57.wav_ASR	why didn't i think of that before
65-2_100.765_5.64.wav_ASR	i i i before before my eighty four accident i woulda thought of that immediately
65-2_107.061_5.26.wav_ASR	but it's much more difficult and and takes longer than it did
65-2_112.37_1.84.wav_ASR	and that's it's like i say
65-2_114.233_1.4.wav_ASR	been that way for thirty six years
65-2_127.18_6.21.wav_ASR	the first one was a where i was tl boned at an intersection
65-2_134.294_2.7.wav_ASR	and ended up being a
65-2_137.011_6.39.wav_ASR	i i caught the the old international harvester scout in the driver's side door
65-2_144.01_12.54.wav_ASR	and had a shattered pelvis broken hip five broken ribs fractured skull a a basal skull fracture ruptured spleen torn diaphragm torn liver
65-2_157.19_1.61.wav_ASR	did i say punctured lung
65-2_159.526_1.7.wav_ASR	seventeen units of blood
65-2_161.937_1.51.wav_ASR	three and a half weeks in a coma
65-2_164.72_6.62.wav_ASR	and and i in a coma for three and a half weeks
65-2_172.132_7.28.wav_ASR	hospital probably probably about two and a half months
65-2_180.19_6.53.wav_ASR	and our third child was born three days after i was moved out of i c u
65-2_190.003_8.12.wav_ASR	and the second one was february of nineteen ninety where i got hit by a car walking across tenth street of indianapolis
65-2_199.113_2.48.wav_ASR	there was a sheared tibia and fibula on the left side
65-2_202.563_6.32.wav_ASR	i believe that i was unconscious for
65-2_209.678_1.66.wav_ASR	well i i guess i don't know how long
65-2_212.237_10.04.wav_ASR	but i recall walking across the street starting across and seeing the corner panel of the car in front of me
65-2_223.056_2.51.wav_ASR	and then i had the the sensation being spun around
65-2_226.386_7.17.wav_ASR	and then later like i say i i i first start remembering things maybe
65-2_234.386_0.46.wav_ASR	i don't know
65-2_234.865_0.96.wav_ASR	twenty minutes later
65-2_236.459_2.59.wav_ASR	and and i i was in a great mood
65-2_239.878_5.52.wav_ASR	i was in a wonderful mood because the eighty four accident the last thing i remember is five days before the accident
65-2_246.349_7.14.wav_ASR	and and this one is february nineteen ninety i knew exactly where i was what i was doing and what happened
65-2_254.174_2.51.wav_ASR	and i was in a really great mood
65-2_257.551_13.19.wav_ASR	and then i say a a brain injury because i think it was about one day or two days later i developed double vision
65-2_271.809_19.88.wav_ASR	and except for extraordinary pain in the leg from that the the not knowing if the double vision would ever go away was most disconcerting if you will
65-2_292.55_3.94.wav_ASR	it did finally go away when the brain swelling went down
65-2_296.863_0.66.wav_ASR	finally went away
65-2_297.627_3.16.wav_ASR	something something like that
65-2_303.117_1.68.wav_ASR	but it lasted a significant amount of time
65-2_305.602_7.65.wav_ASR	and and the the doctors could not tell me whether the the double vision would ever go away
65-2_313.306_5.33.wav_ASR	it was extraordinary painful
65-2_318.652_8.33.wav_ASR	and and i recall that the orthopedic guy that stuck a pin in my tibia said
65-2_327.006_12.71.wav_ASR	oh after after three or four months when when the all the the fissures and the tibia and fibula started to heal he said
65-2_340.67_4.18.wav_ASR	oh you know that's probably the most painful injury known to man
65-2_345.576_0.85.wav_ASR	oh okay
65-2_346.527_1.96.wav_ASR	yeah wasn't just me being a big baby then right
65-2_349.558_1.88.wav_ASR	and he he he chuckled
65-2_353.552_2.83.wav_ASR	that that's kind of it it
65-2_356.478_4.01.wav_ASR	those are the two accidents in at a top level
65-2_372.985_7.65.wav_ASR	west tenth and grandy going into allison road into my employer allison transmission
65-2_399.4_12.1.wav_ASR	the after the first the eighty four incident when i did not know
65-2_411.553_17.22.wav_ASR	what had happened was that the eighty four laptops were first adopted if you will by by by the company
65-2_429.508_17.32.wav_ASR	and and my my boss at that time i i sent sent brought one down for me to to
65-2_447.04_0.75.wav_ASR	i'll call it
65-2_449.397_1.27.wav_ASR	i won't say leisure work play with
65-2_450.939_2.51.wav_ASR	but but learn how to use there there at home
65-2_454.232_6.24.wav_ASR	and of course this is before the web eighty four and and those kind of things
65-2_460.758_11.03.wav_ASR	but i had been doing a a nastran which is nasa structural analysis work for the company for quite a long time
65-2_472.499_9.05.wav_ASR	and but that was all on ibm punch cards and that kind of stuff or or main or a desktop computer
65-2_482.344_4.62.wav_ASR	and and so here is just a a simple little laptop
65-2_486.979_1.14.wav_ASR	oughta be able to know how to use that
65-2_488.329_4.44.wav_ASR	and and so my boss brought his laptop down
65-2_492.784_4.6.wav_ASR	and and in those years there was a a user manual that came along with it
65-2_498.448_4.81.wav_ASR	and so tried to use an a computer user manual
65-2_503.994_7.47.wav_ASR	if you've ever read a microsoft manual of any kind they are extraordinarily difficult
65-2_512.342_14.661.wav_ASR	and one one thing in particular which what was was problematic in the manual was when it said to select something
65-2_528.184_0.51.wav_ASR	selectq
65-2_528.839_12.43.wav_ASR	well had we never had any training in in a laptop or microsoft what what what did selectq mean
65-2_542.262_6.07.wav_ASR	and and after several days of trying to figure out what selectq meant
65-2_548.888_1.04.wav_ASR	there's one aphasia
65-2_550.399_0.6.wav_ASR	select meat
65-2_551.438_0.49.wav_ASR	an aphasia
65-2_552.509_5.58.wav_ASR	what what they meant by selectq i couldn't figure it out
65-2_558.551_0.56.wav_ASR	i just could not
65-2_559.312_1.04.wav_ASR	there was no way
65-2_560.944_2.31.wav_ASR	i'm extraordinary troubled really troubled by that
65-2_564.422_5.97.wav_ASR	and so so finally i called a coworker and said
65-2_570.608_3.88.wav_ASR	what what what does this mean to me when they say selectq
65-2_575.568_7.44.wav_ASR	and it described the tapping the cursor and moving the cursor along holding the cursor down and highlighting an area
65-2_583.899_1.23.wav_ASR	that's what they meant by selectq
65-2_585.777_2.95.wav_ASR	well hell that was never described in the manual at all
65-2_589.857_3.86.wav_ASR	and that threw me for a loop for several days
65-2_594.838_7.3.wav_ASR	and so i became became very questioning as to whether whether i would could go back to work or even function at work
65-2_603.43_5.21.wav_ASR	and and so so finally the the like i say the the temp from the coworker
65-2_609.025_0.57.wav_ASR	oh okay
65-2_609.645_8.98.wav_ASR	the most most basic of terms which the the dos manual
65-2_619.047_2.1.wav_ASR	no no this is dos not microsoft
65-2_621.166_1.3.wav_ASR	this is before microsoft existed
65-2_623.365_14.01.wav_ASR	this dos manual it did not comprehend that somebody would would have the the gall enough the temerity enough to question the meaning of selectq
65-2_638.605_1.01.wav_ASR	but they did not
65-2_640.35_2.3.wav_ASR	dos manual did not describe that anywhere
65-2_643.738_14.19.wav_ASR	and so i went back to work and struggling with the aphasia and short term memory issues and the like and trying to to to function
65-2_658.457_15.64.wav_ASR	and and finally my my after a couple years company brought out their what they call their franklin planner and and said said
65-2_675.07_5.2.wav_ASR	you take the franklin planner and and write stuff down
65-2_681.229_2.47.wav_ASR	and so wow that was a godsend
65-2_684.72_2.15.wav_ASR	i mean just being able to to write write things down
65-2_686.892_1.67.wav_ASR	so i i carry a small
65-2_689.233_0.96.wav_ASR	don't have with me right now
65-2_690.968_8.11.wav_ASR	but i carry a small notecard notebook wherever i go yet today
65-2_699.671_10.58.wav_ASR	because that writing when when when my my boss figured told me how to write stuff done with a franklin planner
65-2_710.85_7.47.wav_ASR	holy mackerel that that was a new lease on life if you will
65-2_719.266_2.66.wav_ASR	that that in particular
65-2_721.95_17.32.wav_ASR	and and also i ended up as a camera manager for the company in the defense products meeting all kinds of people at at at shows shows at conferences that kind of stuff
65-2_739.905_10.88.wav_ASR	i developed tricks where i when i meet somebody new i will always say their name over and over and over again silently to myself
65-2_751.358_5.4.wav_ASR	use their name in any kind of verbal verbal conversation with them
65-2_757.276_2.99.wav_ASR	use their name every time first or last name or or both
65-2_760.315_4.68.wav_ASR	and and then after the conversation write their name down
65-2_766.354_8.45.wav_ASR	and and and that's that's a viable trick that i still use today
65-2_775.921_2.94.wav_ASR	for example in our neighborhood met a
65-2_779.492_1.18.wav_ASR	i'm at home now
65-2_781.203_0.98.wav_ASR	not down the farm
65-2_782.926_11.55.wav_ASR	but met a fellow in the neighborhood out for a walk of several days ago and moved to the neighborhood from sometime back
65-2_794.526_1.25.wav_ASR	and i got his name
65-2_795.797_6.87.wav_ASR	and so then said his name over and over again and the like and told my wife about it and then then wrote it down
65-2_803.378_7.6.wav_ASR	and this morning i saw him out for a walk and and couldn't recall his name at first but then then thought for awhile
65-2_810.996_1.51.wav_ASR	and then finally the name came to
65-2_813.742_14.39.wav_ASR	so but but the the discipline on on recalling names has been quite an invaluable tool and helped helped me return to functionality
65-2_839.375_0.52.wav_ASR	yes yes
65-2_840.697_4.78.wav_ASR	the i think i mentioned to you last week
65-2_846.085_1.32.wav_ASR	possibly i didn't
65-2_847.746_4.92.wav_ASR	but i'd spent some time at the rehab hospital of indiana as a volunteer zero zero
65-2_853.54_6.13.wav_ASR	and because i i started zero was twenty years after the eighty four injury
65-2_860.446_8.79.wav_ASR	and it became rather troubling to me because having they just didn't do therapy for the brain injured in those years
65-2_869.993_1.69.wav_ASR	so there was no therapy
65-2_871.699_1.97.wav_ASR	you're able to survive
65-2_873.684_3.67.wav_ASR	the thing you're able to just could just check for hospital and go home
65-2_878.184_5.53.wav_ASR	and because they just did not do therapy in those years
65-2_883.737_16.3.wav_ASR	and and over the course the next twenty years wife and i found out about from people that had had therapy brain injuries later that the divorce rate amongst the brain injured approaches ninety percent
65-2_901.056_3.61.wav_ASR	and the suicide rate amongst the brain injured is four to five times the national average
65-2_905.719_4.72.wav_ASR	that's what they're telling people even fifteen years ago
65-2_911.291_15.93.wav_ASR	and so i wanted to share that with with the patients at rhi to just to to give them hope that that recovery is is possible
65-2_928.404_1.38.wav_ASR	but it is takes a long time
65-2_930.61_10.94.wav_ASR	and in zero i started there at rhi i heard neurosurgeons telling patients and their families
65-2_942.297_1.58.wav_ASR	yup a year to year and a half recovery
65-2_944.156_1.01.wav_ASR	year to year and a half recovery
65-2_945.302_0.94.wav_ASR	year to year and a half recovery
65-2_947.407_3.51.wav_ASR	hey you don't stop recovering
65-2_950.937_7.04.wav_ASR	the rate may be asymptotic if you will and slow down pretty rapidly after a a year to year and a half
65-2_958.775_1.9.wav_ASR	but you never never stop recovering
65-2_961.454_7.72.wav_ASR	in the eighty eighty four incident i had a a dead spot with no feeling above the left hip
65-2_970.136_2.65.wav_ASR	and it was just something that i accepted
65-2_972.842_1.73.wav_ASR	and i could function without it
65-2_974.655_0.98.wav_ASR	no no big deal
65-2_975.956_3.16.wav_ASR	but to stick a pin there and i don't wouldn't couldn't wouldn't feel it
65-2_979.96_1.4.wav_ASR	no no big deal
65-2_981.865_4.86.wav_ASR	and then it was probably five years ago or twenty twenty five
65-2_987.413_0.4.wav_ASR	i think it was yeah
65-2_987.879_0.74.wav_ASR	i think it was zero
65-2_989.309_5.7.wav_ASR	twenty five years after the eighty four incident i was in the bedroom putting my sock socks one morning
65-2_996.424_4.47.wav_ASR	and i had feeling in the spot that had no feeling for twenty five years
65-2_1002.063_12.36.wav_ASR	so what i'm telling you actually is that the recovery may slow down like i say and mathematically described asymptotic but but still slow down significantly
65-2_1014.632_2.9.wav_ASR	but but still you never stop recovering
65-2_1017.689_1.16.wav_ASR	you just don't stop recovering
65-2_1019.52_6.059.wav_ASR	i've i'm done preaching
65-2_1068.805_3.42.wav_ASR	yes it's not not rocket science
65-2_1072.242_7.48.wav_ASR	it it time time is your best ally in in those kind of cases
65-2_1080.467_7.98.wav_ASR	because you you the feeling that you don't have it it lessen in importance
65-2_1088.535_2.52.wav_ASR	and and you'll notice one day it'll it'll
65-2_1091.749_2.26.wav_ASR	oh oh crap i i i have feeling there that i didn't have before
65-2_1094.551_1.56.wav_ASR	it actually it will happen
65-2_1096.384_0.98.wav_ASR	you will experience it
65-2_1108.416_2.63.wav_ASR	actually actually no
65-2_1111.095_6.75.wav_ASR	i mean i was used to feel like a little pinprick every once in awhile
65-2_1118.126_4.87.wav_ASR	but but i i don't know if i got used to it or or ignored it or or what
65-2_1124.138_3.5.wav_ASR	but but like i say twenty five years later i just put on my socks one morning
65-2_1128.17_0.83.wav_ASR	hey wait a minute
65-2_1129.343_1.05.wav_ASR	i've got feeling there
65-2_1131.24_2.06.wav_ASR	and had had had none before
65-2_1134.534_0.63.wav_ASR	i i don't know when it happened
65-2_1135.397_0.91.wav_ASR	have have no idea
65-2_1149.083_1.64.wav_ASR	they will
65-2_1150.924_0.87.wav_ASR	the nerves will work again
65-2_1151.84_1.31.wav_ASR	they they will actually
65-2_1153.17_0.46.wav_ASR	they will
65-2_1173.169_4.87.wav_ASR	when i first first time i met my wife
65-2_1179.585_5.52.wav_ASR	when i she and i first met went we high school graduates
65-2_1185.345_2.45.wav_ASR	we went to different high schools together
65-2_1188.603_5.09.wav_ASR	her in washington indiana
65-2_1193.708_1.47.wav_ASR	and myself from plainfield
65-2_1195.197_4.75.wav_ASR	and it was before classes started at purdue
65-2_1200.599_1.59.wav_ASR	august of nineteen seventy two
65-2_1203.067_4.66.wav_ASR	it was her first day on campus
65-2_1208.447_1.29.wav_ASR	my first day on campus
65-2_1210.419_10.65.wav_ASR	there was to be a a dance at the the dorm i was staying at this this this one night at our
65-2_1221.089_2.26.wav_ASR	again again each is our first first day on campus
65-2_1224.373_5.17.wav_ASR	and and and and so i was a little bit early
65-2_1229.596_7.78.wav_ASR	which i i will arrive but place a little bit early given given control of of of of a situation
65-2_1238.004_3.79.wav_ASR	and so i ended up being just a little bit early for the dance there
65-2_1242.551_5.71.wav_ASR	and and my wife and and her her her wingman her
65-2_1248.927_1.99.wav_ASR	guy girl girls girls go with with body guards
65-2_1251.625_0.36.wav_ASR	i think it's a
65-2_1252.36_7.75.wav_ASR	her and her wife and her and saying you know wingman showed up there at at this this
65-2_1260.78_3.88.wav_ASR	and and firstnames's wife has never met a stranger
65-2_1265.396_2.78.wav_ASR	the she's the a a true extrovert
65-2_1268.95_2.08.wav_ASR	matter of fact if you look up in webster extrovert and it said
65-2_1272.802_5.88.wav_ASR	so so she and a girlfriend that her her her wingman well walked up to me and said
65-2_1278.901_2.74.wav_ASR	oh hey is the the dance here
65-2_1281.66_2.44.wav_ASR	and and wellco i answered
65-2_1284.355_0.44.wav_ASR	well it's supposta be
65-2_1284.946_0.71.wav_ASR	that's why i'm here
65-2_1285.671_4.64.wav_ASR	and and then we i hung around
65-2_1290.557_3.4.wav_ASR	i i i hung around her that that that that dance
65-2_1294.796_2.28.wav_ASR	and that's where we started dating
65-2_1297.1_3.94.wav_ASR	and and we we dated probably three years or so
65-2_1301.09_1.27.wav_ASR	dated around about three years or so
65-2_1303.312_4.59.wav_ASR	and after about four years i figured out that wellco maybe something's going on here
65-2_1307.917_1.44.wav_ASR	and i oughta get more serious about this
65-2_1310.334_6.28.wav_ASR	so it was just like i i accused her of of picking me up at a school dance
65-2_1317.648_2.02.wav_ASR	that's where where we first met is she picked me up at a dance
65-2_1359.514_5.59.wav_ASR	a young boy it's look like a a grade schooler's had a soccer ball
65-2_1365.124_0.54.wav_ASR	is kicking it
65-2_1366.388_2.61.wav_ASR	and he he it ends up going through a house window
65-2_1369.723_9.4.wav_ASR	a gentleman on a couch there in the window sitting right by where the soccer ball comes through and knocks a lamp down and surprises him
65-2_1379.989_6.19.wav_ASR	and then he he he gets the ball stands by the broken window trying to find out just what went on
65-2_1402.182_12.63.wav_ASR	in the beginning this this mother it appears is had an umbrella and wanted to give it to her son before he goes off to school or go to somewhere
65-2_1415.551_2.24.wav_ASR	and he he says
65-2_1418.288_0.93.wav_ASR	he says no and says
65-2_1419.62_0.77.wav_ASR	no no mom i don't need that
65-2_1421.306_1.08.wav_ASR	and then then leaves
65-2_1422.451_2.41.wav_ASR	and then in the middle it starts raining on him
65-2_1425.438_1.43.wav_ASR	and then rains heavier on him
65-2_1426.933_7.19.wav_ASR	and then he goes back home just soaked to the bone as with mother kind of frowning at that
65-2_1434.453_6.25.wav_ASR	and then the end of the story was he learned his lesson and has the umbrella with him is walking in the rain
65-2_1455.01_13.73.wav_ASR	the way this started was that the it looks like that there's a a a tree with a dog at the base of the tree a a a male at the first tree limb
65-2_1469.12_2.18.wav_ASR	a dog is barking at this guy
65-2_1471.974_7.79.wav_ASR	and on a tree limb there's a cat with a girl down and a tricycle down below this cat
65-2_1480.206_6.04.wav_ASR	and it would appear that a cat climbed up the tree
65-2_1487.152_3.15.wav_ASR	the a little girl's cat climbed up the tree and got stuck up there
65-2_1491.016_10.21.wav_ASR	they they they a man was either being chased up the tree by the dog or or climbed up the tree to help get the little girl's cat
65-2_1501.878_3.4.wav_ASR	there's also a a firetruck and a fire engine
65-2_1506.838_1.32.wav_ASR	but a pair of firemen carrying a ladder
65-2_1508.684_7.57.wav_ASR	and it looks like the the the ladder is being used by the firemen to rescue either the the man or the cat or both
65-2_1517.004_11.24.wav_ASR	and a songbird is over on a a a remote tree limb just singing away just observing the whole story
65-2_1528.296_3.07.wav_ASR	okay done
65-2_1754.983_9.4.wav_ASR	cinderella was a a daughter a subject of a kingdom whose
65-2_1764.522_2.45.wav_ASR	she her mother passed away
65-2_1767.818_1.36.wav_ASR	and her father remarried
65-2_1769.925_8.29.wav_ASR	and the stepmother had two two daughters who were were mean mean daughters
65-2_1778.914_21.3.wav_ASR	and after they were married the father and and stepmother married the stepmother put cinderella to work around the house where the stepdaughters were did did did did basically nothing
65-2_1801.139_8.38.wav_ASR	and so so cinderella spent her time working cleaning polishing that kind of stuff around the house
65-2_1810.138_10.22.wav_ASR	and and in the kingdom there was a a prince who was not married
65-2_1821.196_18.68.wav_ASR	an advisor to the king suggested a a a ball be held you know with the the express expect express purpose of introducing the his his son to the eligible young ladies in the kingdom
65-2_1840.902_3.19.wav_ASR	so the word was put out about the ball coming up
65-2_1844.858_6.3.wav_ASR	cinderella was real happy about the ball coming coming up as were the the stepsisters
65-2_1851.712_16.43.wav_ASR	and so the the the the birds mice made a a beautiful dress for cinderella for the ball
65-2_1868.918_10.26.wav_ASR	and and then at the last minute the stepmother told cinderella she was not going to the ball
65-2_1879.2_8.54.wav_ASR	and and then also the the the stepdaughters were were really really really mean to her
65-2_1888.574_2.81.wav_ASR	and so so the stepdaughters went to the ball
65-2_1892.097_14.38.wav_ASR	and but in the meantime while before the ball a cinderella's fairy godmother showed up and and said that well
65-2_1906.5_5.6.wav_ASR	and so it it made for her a just a a lovely gown
65-2_1912.863_16.73.wav_ASR	and they then turned a a pumpkin into a coach pulled by by by mice i believe that ended up were turned into horses
65-2_1930.594_4.29.wav_ASR	and so she ended up going to the ball
65-2_1935.637_15.69.wav_ASR	and the prince was acquainted with the the stepdaughters and and everyone around there and and and only hit it off with cinderella
65-2_1951.795_2.29.wav_ASR	ended up spending the night dancing with cinderella
65-2_1954.409_7.13.wav_ASR	but the fairy godmother told cinderella that that you hafta be home home by midnight because this this all will end at midnight
65-2_1962.363_5.08.wav_ASR	and so the the the the prince and cinderella were dancing at midnight
65-2_1967.926_1.87.wav_ASR	and and and cinderella said
65-2_1970.219_0.31.wav_ASR	oh no
65-2_1970.547_6.69.wav_ASR	and and runs runs out of the place leaving one glass slipper behind
65-2_1978.161_9.82.wav_ASR	and and as she's being driven driven back home the the coach turns back into a pumpkin
65-2_1988.0_2.49.wav_ASR	the the horse turned back into the mice
65-2_1990.617_5.26.wav_ASR	and the the footman turned back into a horse and or or or dogs
65-2_1996.13_0.56.wav_ASR	i don't remember what
65-2_1997.231_3.15.wav_ASR	and then so but still that then it was over
65-2_2000.401_10.91.wav_ASR	and and then after the ball the the prince decided that there's only only this cinderella that he were interested in
65-2_2012.653_3.04.wav_ASR	but nobody knew who cinderella was and could not find her
65-2_2016.419_10.69.wav_ASR	and so he he put his advisor out to the task of of trying to locate cinderella with the glass slipper that that she left behind
65-2_2027.888_3.08.wav_ASR	and came to cinderella's house
65-2_2031.017_3.76.wav_ASR	the the slipper did not fit the the stepsisters
65-2_2035.46_4.69.wav_ASR	but but turned out it did fit cinderella
65-2_2041.079_9.609.wav_ASR	and so so they end up being that that cinderella and the prince got together and were married and lived happily ever after
65-2_2063.239_2.41.wav_ASR	very you have two slices of bread
65-2_2066.402_6.391.wav_ASR	you have the ingredients of peanut butter and jelly and have a knife or or a spoon
65-2_2073.536_1.341.wav_ASR	you lay out your two pieces of bread
65-2_2075.728_3.94.wav_ASR	spread the peanut butter from the jar on one of the pieces of of bread
65-2_2080.572_5.141.wav_ASR	and then you you spread the jelly on the other piece of bread
65-2_2086.377_2.24.wav_ASR	and then you put the pieces of bread together
65-2_2088.635_2.25.wav_ASR	and there you have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich
richardson16a_10.7_4.51.wav_ASR	struggles yeah
richardson16a_17.87_12.8.wav_ASR	i i i don't talk a lot since the the the stroke
richardson16a_31.22_5.93.wav_ASR	i so i don't get a lot to practice talking
richardson16a_49.929_0.47.wav_ASR	yes
richardson16a_52.74_11.92.wav_ASR	i i was off from work saturday just watching tv
richardson16a_65.34_2.55.wav_ASR	and this thing i know
richardson16a_68.947_2.09.wav_ASR	i didn't know where i was
richardson16a_71.271_1.62.wav_ASR	this happened like this
richardson16a_73.45_11.01.wav_ASR	and i stayed home for five days didn't call or nothing to nobody
richardson16a_85.34_7.84.wav_ASR	one of the guys i worked with came by checking on me
richardson16a_93.372_9.44.wav_ASR	luckily he he sent the ambulance over just check on me too
richardson16a_103.78_7.31.wav_ASR	and they knocked on the door
richardson16a_111.14_3.2.wav_ASR	and i came to it and did like
richardson16a_115.09_0.66.wav_ASR	what's up
richardson16a_116.187_1.13.wav_ASR	what happened
richardson16a_118.44_2.68.wav_ASR	just slammed the door and walked away
richardson16a_122.01_12.89.wav_ASR	and albert later the same guy came back checking on me and took me to the va
richardson16a_135.763_3.57.wav_ASR	and they did an m r i and like
richardson16a_140.09_0.74.wav_ASR	oh shit
richardson16a_141.446_4.6.wav_ASR	and he calls over here and rushed me over
richardson16a_146.61_1.13.wav_ASR	but
richardson16a_154.268_2.58.wav_ASR	but i'm alive
richardson16a_160.82_12.18.wav_ASR	i thought he was selling something a door to door salesman
richardson16a_175.24_8.44.wav_ASR	i didn't think about it or realize what what he was doing
richardson16a_192.159_8.25.wav_ASR	rehab at health south
richardson16a_200.986_4.88.wav_ASR	they taught me to walk and use my hands
richardson16a_207.29_11.81.wav_ASR	they tried to get me to talk more but i did so mm slowly
richardson16a_231.758_0.3.wav_ASR	yeah
richardson16a_247.01_15.92.wav_ASR	when my daughter was born in nineteen ninety six that was a happy time for me seeing her born
richardson16a_263.375_7.71.wav_ASR	but when she was born she was almost almost this color
richardson16a_275.15_7.61.wav_ASR	they had to put her in a incubator for an hour or two
richardson16a_283.058_9.21.wav_ASR	she she changed from that color to her color like that
richardson16a_295.471_11.05.wav_ASR	i was okay at first but when i seen all that blood i'm like
richardson16a_306.766_0.5.wav_ASR	oh shit
richardson16a_308.66_2.43.wav_ASR	yeah i hadta walk out

tcu07a_312.787_1.43.wav_ASR	you know i find myself
tcu07a_314.811_3.77.wav_ASR	it seems like every time i a little bit more you know
tcu07a_318.6_0.53.wav_ASR	so
tcu07a_320.674_0.42.wav_ASR	yeah
tcu07a_322.153_0.55.wav_ASR	yeah
tcu07a_358.045_6.12.wav_ASR	there's a bunch of them but i you know
tcu07a_365.261_1.33.wav_ASR	yeah but being
tcu07a_367.6_2.3.wav_ASR	but it's hard to think of of them
tcu07a_370.3_3.58.wav_ASR	i
tcu07a_374.981_1.26.wav_ASR	yeah probably
tcu07a_378.643_0.4.wav_ASR	no
tcu07a_386.09_0.55.wav_ASR	yeah
tcu07a_387.006_0.82.wav_ASR	that's a good one
tcu07a_390.512_0.62.wav_ASR	i like my dog
tcu07a_391.301_5.4.wav_ASR	he he he gives me a lot of time
tcu07a_396.719_2.71.wav_ASR	i mean he if i didn't have him i up
tcu07a_401.411_5.31.wav_ASR	but that keeps a lot a lot of the time for me
tcu07a_408.237_4.18.wav_ASR	let's let's see
tcu07a_413.77_2.46.wav_ASR	i'm trying to think what else i can talk about
tcu07a_422.86_7.74.wav_ASR	well i don't know if i can
tcu07a_431.851_1.14.wav_ASR	can and golly
tcu07a_433.5_4.17.wav_ASR	it's it's it is kinda hard find to find things
tcu07a_437.686_2.63.wav_ASR	it's hard to talk a lot of things
tcu07a_440.368_3.96.wav_ASR	i'm trying to think who can
tcu07a_445.416_6.7.wav_ASR	i know they but sometimes i don't
tcu07a_454.244_1.07.wav_ASR	they it's funny

tcu07a_462.238_2.28.wav_ASR	and but i don't remember
tcu07a_464.828_0.52.wav_ASR	i don't know
tcu07a_465.853_0.65.wav_ASR	it's weird
tcu07a_473.491_1.459.wav_ASR	yeah i i kinda wonder you know
tcu07a_474.967_2.21.wav_ASR	i remember it but i don't
tcu07a_477.224_2.28.wav_ASR	but i mean i i know it but
tcu07a_481.185_1.145.wav_ASR	i know it down here but i don't know

tcu07a_759.12_5.13.wav_ASR	so he can his make it down man
tcu07a_766.256_4.05.wav_ASR	but the reason he was on here the
tcu07a_771.091_5.47.wav_ASR	because was trying to help her
tcu07a_777.474_8.41.wav_ASR	with the cat cat
tcu07a_786.29_0.77.wav_ASR	i can't think of it
tcu07a_788.525_7.26.wav_ASR	and and that's how in the anyway
tcu07a_796.339_5.59.wav_ASR	but ended up he being seemed to be the one that was in
tcu07a_803.428_0.37.wav_ASR	okay
tcu07a_810.884_0.43.wav_ASR	yeah
tcu07a_817.503_0.34.wav_ASR	no
tcu07a_822.929_1.62.wav_ASR	mkay
tcu07a_824.817_0.32.wav_ASR	uhhuh
tcu07a_829.258_0.31.wav_ASR	okay
tcu07a_832.777_0.33.wav_ASR	mkay
tcu07a_923.902_0.54.wav_ASR	mkay
tcu07a_932.792_1.57.wav_ASR	mkay
tcu07a_936.625_3.32.wav_ASR	she was a
tcu07a_943.222_1.11.wav_ASR	and he
tcu07a_947.118_4.63.wav_ASR	she was little
tcu07a_955.779_0.59.wav_ASR	i mean no
tcu07a_956.619_4.65.wav_ASR	she was a
tcu07a_969.306_4.23.wav_ASR	anyway her her her
tcu07a_974.209_3.69.wav_ASR	she did to be
tcu07a_978.898_11.55.wav_ASR	they were all three gonna going to the ball
tcu07a_991.517_2.85.wav_ASR	it was a ball ball
tcu07a_995.165_3.1.wav_ASR	and they wouldn't let her
tcu07a_999.781_0.87.wav_ASR	so they went
tcu07a_1001.665_2.88.wav_ASR	and and she was sitting there
tcu07a_1004.567_11.65.wav_ASR	and her this lady was like thing her mother
tcu07a_1016.234_0.87.wav_ASR	you know well
tcu07a_1017.905_4.8.wav_ASR	and so she did a thing on him
tcu07a_1023.107_4.01.wav_ASR	she she went
tcu07a_1028.26_2.54.wav_ASR	and she could do it for so long
tcu07a_1031.136_3.36.wav_ASR	and then he he hadta get her home
tcu07a_1034.922_4.78.wav_ASR	because she would be to to back into the
tcu07a_1040.481_1.68.wav_ASR	she would change
tcu07a_1043.239_4.609.wav_ASR	so after that she left her stuff behind
tcu07a_1051.113_2.61.wav_ASR	she lost her thing behind
tcu07a_1054.499_2.85.wav_ASR	so he tried to find her
tcu07a_1058.294_7.77.wav_ASR	and they tried tried to everybody
tcu07a_1066.532_4.0.wav_ASR	and he finally found found her
tcu07a_1070.549_1.74.wav_ASR	she was the one
tcu07a_1072.994_5.63.wav_ASR	and they were in forever
tcu07a_1078.898_1.38.wav_ASR	okay
tcu07a_1090.586_7.4.wav_ASR	i would get the
tcu07a_1102.225_1.53.wav_ASR	i would know
tcu07a_1104.859_11.83.wav_ASR	i would get the two two things of of of bread bread bread
tcu07a_1117.546_9.53.wav_ASR	and then i would get some some some
tcu07a_1130.64_2.36.wav_ASR	and i would do it on the
tcu07a_1134.996_0.58.wav_ASR	alright
tcu07a_1136.123_0.74.wav_ASR	i already said that one
tcu07a_1137.342_7.1.wav_ASR	butter the they would get this in
tcu07a_1145.996_1.79.wav_ASR	thing would be there
tcu07a_1147.803_1.91.wav_ASR	they would butter do that
tcu07a_1150.186_8.47.wav_ASR	and then they would do there
tcu07a_1159.412_1.07.wav_ASR	and do it up
tcu07a_1168.402_0.79.wav_ASR	i am
tcu07a_1172.527_1.39.wav_ASR	i can't butter teak it
tcu07a_1174.758_0.36.wav_ASR	yeah
thompson04a_40.212_0.56.wav_ASR	oh
thompson04a_43.668_1.11.wav_ASR	i don't know
thompson04a_45.764_3.51.wav_ASR	but you know everybody says that they do something and i don't know it e
thompson04a_51.423_0.91.wav_ASR	that's what i do e

thompson04a_523.121_0.73.wav_ASR	probably
thompson04a_526.29_10.82.wav_ASR	hl hl cl hl ml
thompson04a_538.978_4.14.wav_ASR	mhm
thompson04a_544.486_0.78.wav_ASR	that's what it is
thompson04a_545.343_1.02.wav_ASR	that's what it is
thompson04a_547.259_5.14.wav_ASR	one two three four five six seven eight
thompson04a_553.999_0.56.wav_ASR	eight
thompson04a_556.035_5.43.wav_ASR	honolulu
thompson04a_566.895_0.53.wav_ASR	loved it
thompson04a_568.405_0.57.wav_ASR	mhm
thompson04a_569.401_0.9.wav_ASR	mhm that was great
thompson04a_573.076_1.59.wav_ASR	so that's what we did a lot of the times
thompson04a_580.365_2.42.wav_ASR	we did a lot of things
thompson04a_582.994_2.22.wav_ASR	we really did lots and lots
thompson04a_585.618_0.47.wav_ASR	we did them
thompson04a_587.656_1.85.wav_ASR	and we had good times
thompson04a_625.168_6.19.wav_ASR	well his back to us is is a ball
thompson04a_632.063_10.18.wav_ASR	and it's shoes shoes
thompson04a_645.671_1.2.wav_ASR	it's that's not one
thompson04a_647.082_1.51.wav_ASR	it should be right right
thompson04a_648.774_1.69.wav_ASR	yeah right
thompson04a_651.582_1.04.wav_ASR	but that's what he said
thompson04a_652.643_2.25.wav_ASR	he's going to go over to the window
thompson04a_655.361_8.78.wav_ASR	and then from then it goes back in to the bud
thompson04a_664.827_1.97.wav_ASR	well that's the guess
thompson04a_667.577_2.7.wav_ASR	and it is come back here
thompson04a_670.524_1.18.wav_ASR	and that
thompson04a_671.933_5.95.wav_ASR	four and this is where he is exactly with the ball
thompson04a_678.822_4.29.wav_ASR	and right here on his things
thompson04a_683.506_0.58.wav_ASR	that's that's it
thompson04a_685.979_1.15.wav_ASR	isn't that wonderful
thompson04a_689.329_0.47.wav_ASR	no
thompson04a_690.252_0.68.wav_ASR	never mind
thompson04a_690.951_0.73.wav_ASR	it's alright
thompson04a_718.06_5.55.wav_ASR	oh well then what she's done now is got her her umbrella
thompson04a_723.947_1.69.wav_ASR	and she's going to him
thompson04a_725.814_1.36.wav_ASR	tell him to go back
thompson04a_727.275_1.5.wav_ASR	and we tell him and it's
thompson04a_728.934_1.61.wav_ASR	yessir i'm just right here
thompson04a_730.629_3.16.wav_ASR	you don't really need it but i'll i'll have it anyway
thompson04a_733.866_1.23.wav_ASR	so they're going to do
thompson04a_735.374_2.04.wav_ASR	and now oh boy
thompson04a_737.915_20.01.wav_ASR	here is the rain
thompson04a_759.78_2.56.wav_ASR	and now now they're really back
thompson04a_762.358_4.75.wav_ASR	boy it's jumped from this one to this one
thompson04a_769.393_0.93.wav_ASR	and so he is
thompson04a_770.372_0.9.wav_ASR	and back
thompson04a_771.668_0.5.wav_ASR	boy
thompson04a_772.85_3.03.wav_ASR	he knew that he wasn't gonna do it
thompson04a_776.376_1.28.wav_ASR	and that's what he did
thompson04a_777.764_3.69.wav_ASR	and now this time he's back with with the umbrella
thompson04a_784.973_0.91.wav_ASR	isn't
thompson04a_805.778_0.51.wav_ASR	uhhuh
thompson04a_817.409_8.3.wav_ASR	well of course you've got the the cat
thompson04a_828.233_7.5.wav_ASR	and here is she's trying to get her to come back here
thompson04a_837.863_1.27.wav_ASR	and she's already there
thompson04a_839.181_2.29.wav_ASR	but but that's just just hers yes
thompson04a_842.118_0.86.wav_ASR	don't carry that
thompson04a_846.898_0.57.wav_ASR	we do
thompson04a_847.736_3.5.wav_ASR	and this is from him right here

thompson04a_1137.67_0.58.wav_ASR	what is
thompson04a_1151.984_1.2.wav_ASR	i don't know about that
thompson04a_1167.505_2.99.wav_ASR	well he's he's he's all ready
thompson04a_1170.718_4.07.wav_ASR	and he's going to try to to to this one
thompson04a_1175.65_1.57.wav_ASR	well now this is terrible
thompson04a_1177.868_2.34.wav_ASR	again terrible

thompson04a_1192.614_1.04.wav_ASR	what is this
thompson04a_1194.747_1.08.wav_ASR	what is this
thompson04a_1199.943_0.38.wav_ASR	well
thompson04a_1201.114_2.82.wav_ASR	but this is somebody right here right now
thompson04a_1205.422_1.8.wav_ASR	and i don't know about that one
thompson04a_1215.36_7.54.wav_ASR	but that's about all i can do to say that he's going to do it on his
thompson04a_1222.918_3.31.wav_ASR	yes he's well he's got
thompson04a_1235.625_0.52.wav_ASR	oh dread
thompson04a_1241.738_11.45.wav_ASR	what he's got this rescue rescue
thompson04a_1255.731_0.72.wav_ASR	let me think
thompson04a_1259.678_16.87.wav_ASR	he's gonna carry carry yes something like that yes
thompson04a_1278.027_0.98.wav_ASR	a rescue
thompson04a_1279.826_3.6.wav_ASR	but he's got this to get her
thompson04a_1289.102_0.69.wav_ASR	but that is something
thompson04a_1292.985_2.57.wav_ASR	that could be ahere
thompson04a_1296.055_0.38.wav_ASR	okay
thompson04a_1298.501_0.39.wav_ASR	okay
thompson04a_1309.763_2.27.wav_ASR	oh goody goody goody
thompson04a_1316.034_0.91.wav_ASR	well certainly
thompson04a_1324.377_3.66.wav_ASR	well i think everybody else's does i think
thompson04a_1328.059_3.04.wav_ASR	i i yeah
thompson04a_1351.601_0.4.wav_ASR	mhm
thompson04a_1352.919_0.46.wav_ASR	mhm
thompson04a_1685.2_0.45.wav_ASR	oh
thompson04a_1687.735_11.25.wav_ASR	well this was of the the little little cinderella
thompson04a_1700.423_8.07.wav_ASR	and she's been taking up the brushes of everything like this that needs this take
thompson04a_1708.669_13.89.wav_ASR	and lo and behold it's going to be a sisters her sisters her sisters
thompson04a_1723.614_0.5.wav_ASR	no
thompson04a_1747.467_0.66.wav_ASR	daughters
thompson04a_1750.144_3.34.wav_ASR	daughters and the mother
thompson04a_1755.248_5.73.wav_ASR	and they were going to do get this up for this
thompson04a_1761.0_3.22.wav_ASR	and they're gonna have all this stuff for the things
thompson04a_1766.176_5.85.wav_ASR	and she was looking at the the the things
thompson04a_1773.503_0.8.wav_ASR	she looked and
thompson04a_1774.318_1.56.wav_ASR	no oh no
thompson04a_1782.4_4.34.wav_ASR	she was looking for the the the the dress
thompson04a_1786.938_15.74.wav_ASR	and and then all of a sudden that was it where they they went to the
thompson04a_1826.646_3.98.wav_ASR	i mean about about the and then these two right here
thompson04a_1831.59_4.61.wav_ASR	but this is
thompson04a_1843.36_0.8.wav_ASR	let me see
thompson04a_1848.737_1.66.wav_ASR	what go ahead go
thompson04a_1855.562_1.36.wav_ASR	uhuh uhuh
thompson04a_1861.631_0.49.wav_ASR	hmhm
thompson04a_1864.415_5.88.wav_ASR	ball
thompson04a_1871.666_0.43.wav_ASR	a ball
thompson04a_1873.192_0.9.wav_ASR	they had the ball
thompson04a_1874.255_1.48.wav_ASR	and then then they were at
thompson04a_1876.295_12.54.wav_ASR	and and then they were just saying that you saw him with with the cinderella
thompson04a_1890.277_9.22.wav_ASR	and then eventually everybody came in for the two sisters
thompson04a_1900.192_2.05.wav_ASR	and they had nothing nothing
thompson04a_1902.444_7.88.wav_ASR	and then suddenly clear back on the things to the lock
thompson04a_1913.285_2.58.wav_ASR	and she came back in
thompson04a_1916.929_3.56.wav_ASR	and look for her the things for the right here
thompson04a_1921.575_12.74.wav_ASR	and it was then that they got all of this together for the two two two sisters
thompson04a_1936.114_5.23.wav_ASR	and they got wonderful together
thompson04a_1943.135_3.14.wav_ASR	i really don't think this is really going to my thinks
thompson04a_1946.752_2.06.wav_ASR	i really don't think it's going to do it
thompson04a_1949.304_0.86.wav_ASR	not to me
thompson04a_1953.075_0.59.wav_ASR	god
thompson04a_1955.74_0.69.wav_ASR	oh god

thompson04a_1969.225_2.6.wav_ASR	then the all that did you have
thompson04a_1972.089_4.73.wav_ASR	then they have this one to get though they had those together
thompson04a_1976.918_1.61.wav_ASR	oh i saw them like this
thompson04a_1979.546_0.51.wav_ASR	like here
thompson04a_1980.08_0.65.wav_ASR	that's all
thompson04a_1981.881_0.43.wav_ASR	that's all
thompson04a_1983.803_0.98.wav_ASR	yes i will love it
thompson04a_1984.798_0.8.wav_ASR	yes mhm
thompson04a_2002.117_11.38.wav_ASR	well i guess what i would hafta do is hafta have a a bread
thompson04a_2015.25_3.53.wav_ASR	and they'd hafta go back into the
thompson04a_2018.801_1.79.wav_ASR	and then they get back together
thompson04a_2021.15_2.01.wav_ASR	and then they say right back here
thompson04a_2025.804_3.67.wav_ASR	they they go into the toaster
thompson04a_2031.163_4.17.wav_ASR	and they had good good good good fights

UCL02a_6.639_0.36.wav_ASR	m
UCL02a_11.585_0.35.wav_ASR	mhm
UCL02a_13.404_4.57.wav_ASR	so just talking about my my speaking and how it is today this week or
UCL02a_18.68_2.04.wav_ASR	what it could be today or it all depends yeah
UCL02a_25.837_2.86.wav_ASR	my speech and just talking today
UCL02a_31.699_1.62.wav_ASR	my glasses
UCL02a_34.593_2.69.wav_ASR	well firstnamem you don't know
UCL02a_37.33_2.09.wav_ASR	sometimes sometimes it is brilliant this morning isn't it
UCL02a_39.439_0.94.wav_ASR	everything's working a well as
UCL02a_40.4_0.93.wav_ASR	it's brilliant isn't it today
UCL02a_43.429_1.1.wav_ASR	speaking it can be good
UCL02a_44.544_1.86.wav_ASR	sometimes i can talk
UCL02a_47.789_2.6.wav_ASR	not hear what's happening about me now
UCL02a_50.411_1.47.wav_ASR	i can't
UCL02a_53.073_3.41.wav_ASR	you know the me a big problem for me sometimes suddenly one word it's just gone ja
UCL02a_56.5_1.63.wav_ASR	you know dadaF e
UCL02a_58.449_1.89.wav_ASR	like i just talking me out there now i can't remember
UCL02a_61.489_4.3.wav_ASR	some weeks i'm i think i can hear about everything
UCL02a_66.983_3.54.wav_ASR	i can hear everything
UCL02a_70.775_5.62.wav_ASR	and then suddenly it just disappears on me now
UCL02a_77.532_0.76.wav_ASR	it's hard to tell
UCL02a_78.308_2.25.wav_ASR	sometimes suddenly one day it can be perfect
UCL02a_81.517_1.77.wav_ASR	well not perfect i mean but it is decent
UCL02a_83.309_5.47.wav_ASR	then sometimes it's i just can't hear some things you know
UCL02a_88.8_1.82.wav_ASR	that's the difficult thing with with the speech
UCL02a_92.492_4.69.wav_ASR	and then on top of it sometimes it's it's okay
UCL02a_97.24_3.13.wav_ASR	and then of course suddenly one word is just disappearing for me as well
UCL02a_100.812_1.34.wav_ASR	i i'm quite used to that
UCL02a_102.173_0.54.wav_ASR	that's okay
UCL02a_103.893_3.39.wav_ASR	and then suddenly one word is brilliant to speak everybody
UCL02a_107.33_0.65.wav_ASR	it's good for me
UCL02a_108.7_2.11.wav_ASR	and then suddenly just make me so tired
UCL02a_111.006_1.62.wav_ASR	well not tired but then i just can't hear it
UCL02a_112.82_1.55.wav_ASR	it's difficult to tell you know
UCL02a_115.317_8.88.wav_ASR	yeah wanna talk about as well
UCL02a_124.218_1.15.wav_ASR	so many things about me as well
UCL02a_125.597_8.35.wav_ASR	i try many times about my speaking to everybody
UCL02a_134.03_3.34.wav_ASR	sometimes it's brilliant
UCL02a_137.419_4.91.wav_ASR	when people are talking to me and then i guess that what they're talking to me is
UCL02a_142.345_3.14.wav_ASR	and i think maybe one little word is is disappeared for me now
UCL02a_146.052_0.98.wav_ASR	one word is just gone
UCL02a_147.699_2.65.wav_ASR	and then sometimes for me just terrible when i can't hear everything
UCL02a_151.038_4.42.wav_ASR	it's hard to tell about me isn't it
UCL02a_155.949_12.23.wav_ASR	sometimes the bad thing is sometimes whereas you know you i can't do anything for me
UCL02a_168.2_1.91.wav_ASR	that's that's a bit bad and making feel a sort of
UCL02a_171.11_1.02.wav_ASR	it's very difficult for me
UCL02a_172.344_1.12.wav_ASR	it's very difficult sometimes
UCL02a_173.565_1.16.wav_ASR	and it's really really bad with
UCL02a_175.216_2.16.wav_ASR	i can't speak to my
UCL02a_177.398_0.78.wav_ASR	it's happen to me
UCL02a_178.199_1.64.wav_ASR	and that's very difficult sometimes like that
UCL02a_180.635_5.7.wav_ASR	and you get frustrated frustrated frustrated
UCL02a_186.35_0.66.wav_ASR	and i'm saying that yeah
UCL02a_187.33_0.32.wav_ASR	but you know
UCL02a_188.404_3.4.wav_ASR	well that can be terrible sometimes
UCL02a_192.01_4.9.wav_ASR	sometimes like
UCL02a_198.705_2.08.wav_ASR	difficult for me about what talk about speaking as well
UCL02a_200.83_1.55.wav_ASR	sometimes i'd now reading books
UCL02a_202.4_2.79.wav_ASR	i used to read a lot things you know before i did in my stroke obviously
UCL02a_205.21_1.04.wav_ASR	but i read a lot of books
UCL02a_206.693_3.1.wav_ASR	now it's difficult for me as when i speaking but my books to me
UCL02a_210.781_7.56.wav_ASR	and the awful thing for me sometimes when i'm reading some of my books about two pages in me and then i can't remember what i'm talking about
UCL02a_218.619_3.13.wav_ASR	you know half the pages i'm reading about and then suddenly
UCL02a_222.2_2.17.wav_ASR	good yes that's brilliant what i'm reading about
UCL02a_224.65_1.38.wav_ASR	and then suddenly one brain helps me
UCL02a_226.05_0.43.wav_ASR	it's just gone
UCL02a_226.69_0.88.wav_ASR	it's terrible as well
UCL02a_228.468_4.2.wav_ASR	so many time when i'm reading again and i can't remember what i'm talking about the time before
UCL02a_232.729_1.01.wav_ASR	but it's terrible as you know
UCL02a_234.485_8.7.wav_ASR	yeah and that can happen to me sometimes as well like when i'm watching films and things like that for me as well
UCL02a_243.916_13.13.wav_ASR	well watching films or d v d d v ds sometimes i have to watch everything to with subtitles
UCL02a_258.261_9.22.wav_ASR	that's has to be as well like subtitles and i i the the d v ds and the next day again or something like that
UCL02a_268.09_0.94.wav_ASR	so things are again
UCL02a_269.046_0.67.wav_ASR	that's quite good
UCL02a_270.468_3.7.wav_ASR	because i can't what they're talking about without a
UCL02a_274.691_5.27.wav_ASR	subtitles are really good for me important for me really are good for things as well
UCL02a_282.717_3.23.wav_ASR	and then of course what happened to me with my stroke as well
UCL02a_285.97_2.58.wav_ASR	of course you know i did a lot with classical music
UCL02a_288.565_1.94.wav_ASR	that was the
UCL02a_292.355_5.18.wav_ASR	that's the all the classical music place
UCL02a_297.553_2.03.wav_ASR	i was living out in germany in spain and things like that
UCL02a_299.599_4.57.wav_ASR	that was on other thing i was doing was the manager of all the classical music thing with me is there
UCL02a_305.791_4.38.wav_ASR	at least my my classical music is there thank god
UCL02a_311.267_2.23.wav_ASR	what strange me that happened to me
UCL02a_314.212_3.28.wav_ASR	i can hear the words perfectly about me
UCL02a_317.508_1.67.wav_ASR	all the sound of the music is there
UCL02a_319.2_1.21.wav_ASR	i can hear everything perfectly
UCL02a_320.824_0.96.wav_ASR	but then sometimes i remember
UCL02a_322.053_0.66.wav_ASR	oh yeah here's that
UCL02a_323.079_2.0.wav_ASR	oh i can hear that music is
UCL02a_325.1_0.75.wav_ASR	i can hear it as well
UCL02a_326.28_0.58.wav_ASR	but i can't say
UCL02a_327.06_3.92.wav_ASR	yes that was a bit of beethoven and dadaF
UCL02a_331.0_0.95.wav_ASR	i can say oh daF
UCL02a_332.315_0.63.wav_ASR	and then suddenly
UCL02a_333.511_1.24.wav_ASR	oh yeah was it that bit of the
UCL02a_334.876_1.23.wav_ASR	it was the piano bit i was playing
UCL02a_336.218_1.82.wav_ASR	then suddenly one word is just gone for me
UCL02a_339.028_2.35.wav_ASR	useta get that panic about it
UCL02a_341.4_0.32.wav_ASR	now i think
UCL02a_341.803_0.93.wav_ASR	oh firstnamen what it does it matter
UCL02a_342.829_1.91.wav_ASR	you know i can remember the word up here is there
UCL02a_344.964_0.93.wav_ASR	but i can't hear in all of it
UCL02a_347.417_4.47.wav_ASR	but the classical music as well thank god for me as well
UCL02a_351.907_3.12.wav_ASR	i mean thanks my music there as well as you know
UCL02a_355.5_1.15.wav_ASR	i was saying just now
UCL02a_357.482_1.78.wav_ASR	and reading the books can be difficult for me
UCL02a_360.193_2.99.wav_ASR	the films i need the subtitles
UCL02a_363.263_3.04.wav_ASR	but then with the music it's brilliant thank god
UCL02a_367.126_5.98.wav_ASR	many things happened with me and my aphasia and things like that a couple of people as well
UCL02a_373.127_1.85.wav_ASR	and as well
UCL02a_374.999_1.1.wav_ASR	that helps people as well
UCL02a_376.116_0.31.wav_ASR	that helps
UCL02a_376.48_0.38.wav_ASR	and it's good
UCL02a_377.882_5.1.wav_ASR	and i can't remember firstnamem as well
UCL02a_383.006_1.68.wav_ASR	it's just some little things as well you know
UCL02a_384.93_2.72.wav_ASR	some little things but i don't know
UCL02a_388.125_1.06.wav_ASR	yeah that's about it yeah
UCL02a_394.094_1.97.wav_ASR	on the actual day that happened to me yeah
UCL02a_397.44_1.06.wav_ASR	what had happened yeah
UCL02a_399.855_1.57.wav_ASR	well that was in the august
UCL02a_402.334_3.75.wav_ASR	it's the twenty the fifteenth yeah
UCL02a_407.543_0.84.wav_ASR	twenty the fifteenth
UCL02a_408.4_1.08.wav_ASR	yeah that's making sense today yeah
UCL02a_409.58_2.56.wav_ASR	so it's the august before four years ago
UCL02a_414.5_2.34.wav_ASR	yeah what i really remember is really strange for me
UCL02a_416.862_0.77.wav_ASR	it was in the evening
UCL02a_417.65_1.01.wav_ASR	and i got to work
UCL02a_419.58_2.06.wav_ASR	and it was about nine thirty in the morning
UCL02a_422.308_1.74.wav_ASR	i first is in the tube
UCL02a_424.068_1.71.wav_ASR	and then i was going to catch my bus
UCL02a_427.382_1.25.wav_ASR	and i got there into work
UCL02a_429.05_1.69.wav_ASR	and i remember it was really strange
UCL02a_432.378_3.07.wav_ASR	i was gonna go onto my computer
UCL02a_436.506_0.97.wav_ASR	and then suddenly
UCL02a_437.5_2.4.wav_ASR	yeah i was gonna switch it on
UCL02a_440.439_4.99.wav_ASR	and i couldn't remember how can i use my computer
UCL02a_445.929_3.87.wav_ASR	what's my my my code you know your your writing things
UCL02a_450.603_0.68.wav_ASR	come on where is it
UCL02a_451.3_1.04.wav_ASR	come on is it daF
UCL02a_452.404_0.36.wav_ASR	it's terrible
UCL02a_454.288_1.27.wav_ASR	i asked one of my colleagues
UCL02a_455.628_0.46.wav_ASR	and i said
UCL02a_456.246_7.3.wav_ASR	firstnameh i i can't remember how to use my computer and things like that
UCL02a_464.158_1.26.wav_ASR	and then she suddenly noticed
UCL02a_465.465_2.41.wav_ASR	she said to me i wasn't a bit strange to me as well
UCL02a_468.953_0.57.wav_ASR	and some other friend said
UCL02a_470.161_1.38.wav_ASR	well firstnamen are you feeling okay and dadaF
UCL02a_471.8_0.6.wav_ASR	i mean i thought
UCL02a_474.207_0.79.wav_ASR	it was fine for me
UCL02a_475.017_1.76.wav_ASR	i can walking around and things like that you know
UCL02a_476.8_2.11.wav_ASR	but still my brain is
UCL02a_480.117_4.99.wav_ASR	i can remember what my computer was and coming downstairs and things like that and daF
UCL02a_485.795_3.66.wav_ASR	and suddenly some friends they were talking to me
UCL02a_489.477_2.9.wav_ASR	and i couldn't what they were talking to me
UCL02a_494.892_2.06.wav_ASR	and then a friend of mine firstnamel and then she said
UCL02a_497.05_1.56.wav_ASR	oh yeah well must get you sorted out as well
UCL02a_499.0_1.51.wav_ASR	and she called
UCL02a_501.025_2.43.wav_ASR	yeah it was about ten in the morning
UCL02a_503.787_2.13.wav_ASR	well we'll take you off to a hospital a and e
UCL02a_507.338_1.89.wav_ASR	and i sat there for a couple of times as well
UCL02a_509.25_2.01.wav_ASR	and then they queuing for me for about an hour
UCL02a_512.02_0.421.wav_ASR	i sat down
UCL02a_512.456_1.29.wav_ASR	and one guy was talking to me
UCL02a_513.77_1.31.wav_ASR	and there's some other people and
UCL02a_516.39_1.49.wav_ASR	then it might have even got worse
UCL02a_517.899_1.26.wav_ASR	and then i couldn't speak to everybody
UCL02a_519.178_1.81.wav_ASR	it was a bit sort of blahblahblahblahblahb
UCL02a_522.583_7.091.wav_ASR	yeah in hospital there were all of these sort of scan things and sorta like that and things to me
UCL02a_530.449_1.74.wav_ASR	and i couldn't speak thing
UCL02a_533.17_0.79.wav_ASR	i couldn't speak
UCL02a_534.844_2.64.wav_ASR	when people were talking to me i couldn't what they were talking to me
UCL02a_537.5_1.32.wav_ASR	occasionally one word yesq
UCL02a_539.744_1.17.wav_ASR	nothing has gone
UCL02a_542.169_5.25.wav_ASR	yeah that was here
UCL02a_547.468_1.91.wav_ASR	i remember thousands about those ten leaving as well
UCL02a_549.43_5.87.wav_ASR	so then yeah it north north middlesex the first day as well
UCL02a_555.32_1.53.wav_ASR	then i said after that it was about
UCL02a_557.638_2.43.wav_ASR	was it five or six day hours
UCL02a_560.666_2.74.wav_ASR	and they moved me from there down here to ucl here
UCL02a_564.353_1.74.wav_ASR	where the hospital down here
UCL02a_568.078_5.12.wav_ASR	and and that was it as well
UCL02a_573.219_1.35.wav_ASR	oh yeah i mean you know you know
UCL02a_575.827_0.89.wav_ASR	i remember after that
UCL02a_576.741_1.01.wav_ASR	this is about five hours
UCL02a_577.773_1.11.wav_ASR	and then it's it's a bit
UCL02a_579.236_0.55.wav_ASR	i remember getting up
UCL02a_579.81_3.71.wav_ASR	it's quite in the evening as well in hospital
UCL02a_584.84_3.59.wav_ASR	and people were the doctors and time to write for me as well
UCL02a_588.451_4.45.wav_ASR	and it could be that my speaking was even worse that very evening time as well
UCL02a_593.524_2.64.wav_ASR	and the next day as well i just couldn't speak to everybody
UCL02a_597.058_3.09.wav_ASR	i mean all the hospitals were there and looking at me and other papapab
UCL02a_600.25_1.04.wav_ASR	and i couldn't
UCL02a_602.917_2.26.wav_ASR	i i remember now
UCL02a_605.262_2.6.wav_ASR	the first day for me
UCL02a_608.048_0.74.wav_ASR	it was after happened to me
UCL02a_608.959_0.82.wav_ASR	it was terrible
UCL02a_609.799_0.88.wav_ASR	i couldn't to speak to people
UCL02a_610.7_0.75.wav_ASR	people were looking at me
UCL02a_611.467_0.48.wav_ASR	and i was looked
UCL02a_613.201_2.54.wav_ASR	well people are talking to me
UCL02a_615.795_4.6.wav_ASR	and when they are talk to me i couldn't speak to anything
UCL02a_620.505_0.55.wav_ASR	it's terrible
UCL02a_621.961_1.52.wav_ASR	you know they're writing down
UCL02a_624.359_1.26.wav_ASR	some doctors say daF
UCL02a_625.666_1.39.wav_ASR	and i couldn't speak anything as well
UCL02a_628.52_4.16.wav_ASR	that's the worst thing for about you know about it's strange about three or four weeks
UCL02a_632.699_1.28.wav_ASR	i remember as well
UCL02a_634.0_2.21.wav_ASR	and everybody's standing around dadadaF
UCL02a_637.869_2.91.wav_ASR	and then after that as well
UCL02a_640.8_0.48.wav_ASR	so yeah
UCL02a_641.3_2.15.wav_ASR	so i mean after that it was a ucl placing here
UCL02a_644.103_1.81.wav_ASR	and then this place just the recording from here
UCL02a_646.0_0.38.wav_ASR	what is it called
UCL02a_646.4_5.93.wav_ASR	the queen queen queen queen square
UCL02a_652.975_4.0.wav_ASR	the neurorehabilitation
UCL02a_657.478_1.21.wav_ASR	i was there for two weeks as well
UCL02a_659.32_1.48.wav_ASR	and they're testing me up and duhduhdumb
UCL02a_661.705_2.51.wav_ASR	so that that's i i mean it's not make any sense today does it
UCL02a_664.318_1.87.wav_ASR	that's that's the first day the happening on the first stroke yeah
UCL02a_675.556_1.58.wav_ASR	that's like getting any better yeah
UCL02a_677.863_3.8.wav_ASR	it's strange
UCL02a_681.681_3.38.wav_ASR	i suppose the next thing for me itwo weeks after
UCL02a_685.08_1.4.wav_ASR	well the first week at ucl
UCL02a_686.5_1.06.wav_ASR	one week for them
UCL02a_687.622_3.32.wav_ASR	and then two weeks at the neurorehabilitation
UCL02a_691.037_1.37.wav_ASR	i can't speak that first word as well
UCL02a_693.677_2.17.wav_ASR	i remember there that was the first i was about two weeks
UCL02a_695.871_6.85.wav_ASR	and then there's some people were testing me up for like another for for the video
UCL02a_704.304_2.18.wav_ASR	and some lady was a doctor there
UCL02a_706.5_3.48.wav_ASR	she did lots of tests for me and things like that and vidk video
UCL02a_712.938_1.25.wav_ASR	and she some tests me
UCL02a_714.208_1.77.wav_ASR	and you know these photos of me
UCL02a_716.0_3.65.wav_ASR	and you know are these a cats
UCL02a_719.666_1.46.wav_ASR	are they dogs and things like that
UCL02a_721.149_1.73.wav_ASR	and what's this and some other things for me
UCL02a_723.85_4.47.wav_ASR	and sometimes i couldn't what she was talking about
UCL02a_728.336_1.86.wav_ASR	you know is said you know like the photo things
UCL02a_730.212_3.77.wav_ASR	is this is a dog or you know square things and that can remember like that
UCL02a_738.114_2.95.wav_ASR	then after that about two weeks another place
UCL02a_741.126_4.6.wav_ASR	and then that was called the stroke community people as well
UCL02a_747.398_2.78.wav_ASR	and the other thing was then one group of people helping up
UCL02a_750.539_5.96.wav_ASR	the stroke community people are helping me for writing some words for me as well
UCL02a_757.561_3.75.wav_ASR	helping me some words in me
UCL02a_761.331_3.15.wav_ASR	like you know you said monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday saturday
UCL02a_764.5_1.42.wav_ASR	and the first days i couldn't tell for me
UCL02a_766.211_2.02.wav_ASR	you know is it monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday
UCL02a_768.626_0.55.wav_ASR	i couldn't remember
UCL02a_769.252_0.9.wav_ASR	is it monday today
UCL02a_770.176_1.63.wav_ASR	i couldn't speak the word like mondayq
UCL02a_772.961_6.7.wav_ASR	it's the first day second second third four five six
UCL02a_779.679_0.83.wav_ASR	and then i couldn't
UCL02a_781.953_1.63.wav_ASR	i still have problems like that now
UCL02a_783.712_1.47.wav_ASR	is it one two three four five six seven eight
UCL02a_785.2_1.08.wav_ASR	and i double check things like that
UCL02a_786.37_3.78.wav_ASR	but i remember the first time for me i couldn't speak up
UCL02a_790.171_3.41.wav_ASR	you know what days
UCL02a_793.6_0.79.wav_ASR	where am i
UCL02a_795.524_1.21.wav_ASR	where am i going
UCL02a_796.901_1.38.wav_ASR	i couldn't write what things are again
UCL02a_799.104_2.08.wav_ASR	that was difficult for me as well you know
UCL02a_801.24_3.72.wav_ASR	there was some people i suppose for is about
UCL02a_806.4_3.15.wav_ASR	yeah it was about six months she was there
UCL02a_810.46_2.21.wav_ASR	every week for me some lady was talking to me
UCL02a_812.693_6.05.wav_ASR	and just you know reading some words and helping out and dadaF
UCL02a_818.791_1.44.wav_ASR	i suppose that's is about two weeks
UCL02a_821.718_4.68.wav_ASR	and then after that i suppose she had us three weeks
UCL02a_826.419_1.74.wav_ASR	so it was three weeks and tatatab then
UCL02a_828.767_2.69.wav_ASR	i might six weeks or nine weeks i yeah
UCL02a_832.093_7.38.wav_ASR	then after nine months and then with you at the ucl at aphasia
UCL02a_840.063_1.49.wav_ASR	that was you the first test as well
UCL02a_841.662_2.74.wav_ASR	i suppose that was
UCL02a_845.928_4.83.wav_ASR	i think for me you know the stroke from the stroke but at least i can walk around
UCL02a_850.827_3.82.wav_ASR	that was a big problem for my could for me is you know things like that
UCL02a_854.716_0.61.wav_ASR	that was okay
UCL02a_856.337_3.78.wav_ASR	you know out by the bus and the tube and things like that
UCL02a_860.14_0.69.wav_ASR	that was fine for me
UCL02a_861.098_3.8.wav_ASR	i commit panicky about that you know about on the tube by myself
UCL02a_865.175_1.64.wav_ASR	and not being able to help people as well
UCL02a_867.837_2.54.wav_ASR	that's a bit worrying for me
UCL02a_870.4_4.58.wav_ASR	i think i was some people i know with with aphasic people
UCL02a_875.2_1.96.wav_ASR	if you're by yourself a bit panicky
UCL02a_877.224_0.68.wav_ASR	what is gonna happen to you
UCL02a_878.342_1.19.wav_ASR	and is it gonna happen to you
UCL02a_881.28_2.41.wav_ASR	can be worry for me sometimes
UCL02a_883.763_1.66.wav_ASR	but i'm not much better now
UCL02a_885.443_1.45.wav_ASR	but it can be terrible you know
UCL02a_887.833_4.93.wav_ASR	they can't speak what i'm talking about now to other people or you know
UCL02a_893.03_5.1.wav_ASR	but i suppose afterwards that it is better for me now
UCL02a_898.696_6.84.wav_ASR	but yeah i mean physically you walking around
UCL02a_905.56_0.96.wav_ASR	that's fine for me
UCL02a_907.365_2.52.wav_ASR	but it's my own brain thing as well
UCL02a_909.992_0.51.wav_ASR	so there we go
UCL02a_911.188_1.79.wav_ASR	does that make any sense firstnamem yeah
UCL02a_940.576_0.67.wav_ASR	say again
UCL02a_941.493_0.61.wav_ASR	just say it again
UCL02a_942.392_1.14.wav_ASR	you hafta say it again sorry yeah
UCL02a_948.585_0.9.wav_ASR	when i was a little kid
UCL02a_955.002_2.69.wav_ASR	well when i was a kid you said
UCL02a_966.107_3.03.wav_ASR	then then what what really happened to me yeah
UCL02a_971.144_7.25.wav_ASR	is it make any sense to you i'd be able what you you said about what what what what what was happening to me as a kid or yeah
UCL02a_978.444_0.75.wav_ASR	or something like that yeah
UCL02a_979.633_2.56.wav_ASR	you talk about me speaking the language and things like that or no
UCL02a_986.138_3.38.wav_ASR	yeah well it's strange it's strange the other day it's quite strange the couple of days as well
UCL02a_989.538_1.6.wav_ASR	well you see now i'm fifty eight
UCL02a_992.535_2.48.wav_ASR	but i remember i was lucky when i was a kid
UCL02a_995.033_0.71.wav_ASR	it's strange as well
UCL02a_995.761_5.8.wav_ASR	i mean i was about ten ten to thirteen years as a kid
UCL02a_1002.376_7.93.wav_ASR	and i was lucky because i was living in in naples italy as a kid
UCL02a_1010.322_6.55.wav_ASR	i was at boarding school in england as well but then my dad had his job out in italy as well
UCL02a_1017.003_0.78.wav_ASR	i'd be back there as well
UCL02a_1018.974_1.8.wav_ASR	but it's strange you talking about that things happening as well
UCL02a_1020.913_2.78.wav_ASR	but i can remember that was
UCL02a_1024.459_3.88.wav_ASR	they also lived in germany as well about five years as well but then back to england
UCL02a_1029.03_3.799.wav_ASR	and then afterwards back to italy as well
UCL02a_1033.867_3.061.wav_ASR	and it's strange a couple of days
UCL02a_1038.126_1.02.wav_ASR	italy was wonderful
UCL02a_1039.807_0.56.wav_ASR	i was a kid
UCL02a_1040.387_2.99.wav_ASR	we lived just outside of naples
UCL02a_1044.069_3.01.wav_ASR	we had a view from the
UCL02a_1047.13_2.44.wav_ASR	from where i was the distance you could see
UCL02a_1053.355_0.79.wav_ASR	vesuvius
UCL02a_1054.307_0.36.wav_ASR	oh god
UCL02a_1055.824_2.03.wav_ASR	vusk vesuvius
UCL02a_1058.851_0.67.wav_ASR	you know all that thing
UCL02a_1060.129_0.32.wav_ASR	you remember
UCL02a_1061.36_1.67.wav_ASR	vesuvius
UCL02a_1063.289_0.95.wav_ASR	i can't speak the word is
UCL02a_1064.257_1.25.wav_ASR	you know the big
UCL02a_1066.615_3.45.wav_ASR	i can word about it as well

wright204a_163.103_1.76.wav_ASR	the paramedics came up
wright204a_165.426_1.7.wav_ASR	and i said
wright204a_168.011_1.22.wav_ASR	i think i'm having a stroke
wright204a_169.941_1.47.wav_ASR	and they looked at me
wright204a_171.523_2.04.wav_ASR	and then they looked at me again
wright204a_173.581_0.4.wav_ASR	and they said
wright204a_174.146_0.86.wav_ASR	i think you're right
wright204a_176.302_1.03.wav_ASR	so we went
wright204a_177.886_0.79.wav_ASR	everything was fine
wright204a_178.771_1.52.wav_ASR	i was still awake
wright204a_180.306_1.01.wav_ASR	everything was great
wright204a_182.077_6.1.wav_ASR	and that's after going going on in the ambulance i sorta don't remember anything
wright204a_193.108_0.34.wav_ASR	well
wright204a_196.357_2.49.wav_ASR	well this that's a bleeding stroke
wright204a_200.509_1.51.wav_ASR	that was the kind
wright204a_202.822_0.7.wav_ASR	yes right
wright204a_204.132_3.8.wav_ASR	which i understand is little bit less than half survive
wright204a_208.966_0.67.wav_ASR	and that was me
wright204a_210.501_0.9.wav_ASR	i was one of the lucky ones
wright204a_212.664_5.3.wav_ASR	and i i was in three different hospitals
wright204a_218.922_5.15.wav_ASR	and really didn't come out of anything until about
wright204a_225.73_0.45.wav_ASR	well let's see
wright204a_227.123_9.64.wav_ASR	i would say the middle of december just before christmas ol eight is when i remember really for the first time
wright204a_238.834_1.62.wav_ASR	i was out for a lot of times
wright204a_240.614_4.38.wav_ASR	i had all kinds of tests and
wright204a_247.286_2.71.wav_ASR	well i had two or three you know m r is
wright204a_250.143_1.63.wav_ASR	and so
wright204a_252.388_1.03.wav_ASR	i think that's what they're called
wright204a_255.308_1.49.wav_ASR	the machine that puts it on
wright204a_258.047_5.38.wav_ASR	and from then on then i was at burrels
wright204a_263.563_11.04.wav_ASR	and i remember of all of burrels where i had all three at things for speech therapy
wright204a_285.874_1.82.wav_ASR	slower in things
wright204a_288.289_6.62.wav_ASR	i i hadta learn to use more of my left hand than i wanted to
wright204a_295.072_5.09.wav_ASR	but i was paralyzed on the whole right side
wright204a_301.173_1.18.wav_ASR	for quite a long time
wright204a_303.069_4.89.wav_ASR	when i get out of the hospital for the third time i i was in a wheelchair
wright204a_315.318_2.19.wav_ASR	no they were all all from one to the other
wright204a_318.564_0.31.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_319.489_15.42.wav_ASR	from december of ol eight through about the end of september october november december january of ol nine i was in the hospital
wright204a_337.032_3.05.wav_ASR	so because we had different problems
wright204a_340.132_1.81.wav_ASR	i had c diff
wright204a_343.379_4.39.wav_ASR	i had some other kind of things that i i don't even remember
wright204a_348.779_3.78.wav_ASR	and so it it took a long time just to get out of the hospital
wright204a_353.142_6.05.wav_ASR	but i was home in december december january
wright204a_360.553_13.81.wav_ASR	february in february third i started outpatient therapy at chandler regional hospital over in chandler
wright204a_375.474_6.3.wav_ASR	and i'd been there through the the end of of the year
wright204a_391.134_0.65.wav_ASR	that's correct
wright204a_400.899_0.38.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_423.934_1.43.wav_ASR	just well jeez
wright204a_426.385_3.17.wav_ASR	i've i've had a very good life
wright204a_430.939_2.71.wav_ASR	i i don't know
wright204a_434.419_0.39.wav_ASR	i married
wright204a_435.869_1.32.wav_ASR	that was a big event
wright204a_437.931_2.89.wav_ASR	my first child was a big event
wright204a_441.696_4.35.wav_ASR	my second third and fourth children were
wright204a_448.445_4.81.wav_ASR	we just had our fiftieth anniversary this past
wright204a_454.55_4.98.wav_ASR	well it'll be a year in in in march april april april
wright204a_460.255_1.8.wav_ASR	it'll be our fifty
wright204a_462.698_3.202.wav_ASR	so there there's lots of things we did
wright204a_466.905_2.09.wav_ASR	i had a good life as a child
wright204a_469.055_1.22.wav_ASR	i was an only child
wright204a_471.226_6.03.wav_ASR	i i don't really know what to say
wright204a_488.482_2.61.wav_ASR	yeah i also get a little crying when i do that
wright204a_551.677_4.2.wav_ASR	the little boy is one playing with a soccer ball i guess
wright204a_556.512_3.27.wav_ASR	and he happens to hit the window
wright204a_562.435_1.63.wav_ASR	and it goes in
wright204a_564.087_8.98.wav_ASR	and hit it the guy inside is is in the picture is sitting down
wright204a_573.142_3.66.wav_ASR	and it hits him or at at least it comes in the window
wright204a_577.402_1.19.wav_ASR	so he's got glass
wright204a_579.694_1.82.wav_ASR	and he goes out
wright204a_581.882_2.06.wav_ASR	and he looks at the window
wright204a_583.994_0.79.wav_ASR	and he has the ball
wright204a_584.804_8.2.wav_ASR	and apparently he's going out to see what happened and maybe let the ball go back to the little child
wright204a_611.342_0.53.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_612.361_1.49.wav_ASR	looks like it's ready for school
wright204a_614.634_3.67.wav_ASR	she says looks like he might wanna take the umbrella
wright204a_619.559_2.09.wav_ASR	she's apparently she said okay
wright204a_623.716_0.88.wav_ASR	or did she say
wright204a_625.692_0.59.wav_ASR	maybe not
wright204a_626.402_0.35.wav_ASR	i don't know
wright204a_626.8_2.35.wav_ASR	because now he's going to school
wright204a_629.803_0.94.wav_ASR	oh it isn't
wright204a_630.763_0.47.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_633.482_1.14.wav_ASR	he's he says
wright204a_634.899_1.17.wav_ASR	no i don't think i need it
wright204a_637.004_1.53.wav_ASR	he goes out
wright204a_639.482_1.63.wav_ASR	and he must be waiting for the bus
wright204a_641.129_1.2.wav_ASR	and it'sto rain
wright204a_642.924_2.12.wav_ASR	so now it's coming down pretty good
wright204a_645.498_1.72.wav_ASR	so he goes back to the house
wright204a_647.796_0.36.wav_ASR	and he says
wright204a_648.654_0.66.wav_ASR	i'm all wet
wright204a_650.019_0.33.wav_ASR	and he says
wright204a_651.289_1.3.wav_ASR	maybe i better go take the umbrella
wright204a_672.485_0.54.wav_ASR	let's see here now
wright204a_677.959_4.91.wav_ASR	looks like the problem is the cat is stuck up in a tree
wright204a_683.65_0.4.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_685.27_2.21.wav_ASR	father is out on the
wright204a_687.552_3.18.wav_ASR	oh and he's kind of stuck himself i think
wright204a_691.424_2.46.wav_ASR	the little girl is crying for the cat
wright204a_694.509_1.57.wav_ASR	she's got an umbrella
wright204a_696.668_4.34.wav_ASR	there's a dog barking up the tree
wright204a_701.845_1.46.wav_ASR	and the fire department is coming
wright204a_703.403_5.75.wav_ASR	a little girl was was trying to reach him i guess
wright204a_709.619_2.69.wav_ASR	i don't know if she was trying to get this ladder or not
wright204a_712.623_1.35.wav_ASR	i have no idea about that
wright204a_715.021_2.4.wav_ASR	but anyway the firemen are coming
wright204a_717.541_1.03.wav_ASR	the fire truck is there
wright204a_718.865_6.08.wav_ASR	and they're coming out with a ladder apparently to help get the cat and father out of the tree
wright204a_729.715_0.44.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_730.298_1.47.wav_ASR	now that's that's a real picture
wright204a_733.872_5.81.wav_ASR	this is a probably a flooded stream
wright204a_740.511_1.38.wav_ASR	probably right here in arizona
wright204a_744.599_3.77.wav_ASR	and the girl was apparently washed down the river
wright204a_749.301_2.17.wav_ASR	and this is her rescuer
wright204a_752.238_8.31.wav_ASR	and she is hanging onto a branch that they're trying to get her get her to safety
wright204a_764.718_0.38.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_772.353_0.32.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_776.476_0.63.wav_ASR	yes i do
wright204a_903.564_5.15.wav_ASR	well she was
wright204a_911.851_7.38.wav_ASR	the the the story revolves around the two daughters and the what i call the the cruel lady
wright204a_920.645_13.21.wav_ASR	and i i i couldn't remember even from looking at that what the relationship was to the the good girl cinderella
wright204a_935.994_4.63.wav_ASR	she i know that she was like a servant
wright204a_941.361_9.2.wav_ASR	and was they were really putting her down
wright204a_950.842_7.62.wav_ASR	she was always doing stuff where the other two girls were you know not being very nice
wright204a_958.521_3.91.wav_ASR	and it was all nice and stuff for for them
wright204a_962.813_18.18.wav_ASR	when they went to the the ball it turned out that the cinderella was the one who they put the shoe on
wright204a_982.77_14.44.wav_ASR	and she then when they got away because the stagecoach was gonna turn into a pumpkin she had to get back
wright204a_997.767_7.21.wav_ASR	and she she lost a shoe
wright204a_1006.404_0.31.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_1007.312_9.14.wav_ASR	and so then when the the i guess one of the people with the the
wright204a_1018.414_1.11.wav_ASR	well what i wonder would that be
wright204a_1019.765_5.209.wav_ASR	the the the the this it's this
wright204a_1026.704_2.301.wav_ASR	see this is where i trouble with the story
wright204a_1029.076_5.01.wav_ASR	we're trying to get the
wright204a_1037.097_1.48.wav_ASR	's the prince it's the prince
wright204a_1039.786_3.76.wav_ASR	and he he he was trying to find her
wright204a_1044.411_1.69.wav_ASR	and he was out looking
wright204a_1047.777_0.92.wav_ASR	and he had the shoe with him
wright204a_1049.77_4.47.wav_ASR	and it the shoe the only one that really fit was was cinderella
wright204a_1055.312_1.88.wav_ASR	and so he then said
wright204a_1057.679_2.63.wav_ASR	we'll be man and wife
wright204a_1060.912_1.76.wav_ASR	and we'll everything will be fine forever
wright204a_1067.508_0.34.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_1076.539_0.49.wav_ASR	oh yeah
wright204a_1077.591_1.12.wav_ASR	it's one of my favorites
wright204a_1081.112_3.04.wav_ASR	well you need two pieces of bread
wright204a_1084.91_1.51.wav_ASR	and we need peanut butter
wright204a_1086.66_0.79.wav_ASR	and we need jelly
wright204a_1087.972_1.83.wav_ASR	and i i don't put butter on it
wright204a_1089.96_0.57.wav_ASR	i just put
wright204a_1091.312_1.41.wav_ASR	i useta
wright204a_1092.847_1.09.wav_ASR	i don't do that anymore
wright204a_1093.952_6.07.wav_ASR	actually my wife does it now until i can get hand this hand going going because it's kind of weak
wright204a_1100.249_6.65.wav_ASR	but anyway you put peanut butter on the one
wright204a_1107.215_1.62.wav_ASR	and you put jelly on the other
wright204a_1109.293_0.88.wav_ASR	and put them together
wright204a_1110.995_0.48.wav_ASR	slice them
wright204a_1116.724_6.94.wav_ASR	oh i've you know i've i've had peanut butter and jelly as as a child all the way up through through now
