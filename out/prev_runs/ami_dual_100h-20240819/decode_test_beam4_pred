AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0017055_0017265	if two many buttons are pressed
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0164381_0164747	but because if you have a discussive thing here and then another discussive thing there
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0137932_0138302	yeah just search for specific stress
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0128564_0128777	yeah i have i've got one at home
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0171408_0171523	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0210615_0211023	or he doesn't and then only search for one that sort of looks like
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0260376_0260692	um we do we decide whether it should be red
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0113936_0114207	so a nice texture or something is it
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0001955_0002125	so everybody's sitting on the right place
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0132233_0133122	it's just another um i mean these meetings are not endlessly long it's just words and to print all of them out solely
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0119781_0120514	okay no the things that i was thinking and w my wish list is really been realised in this prototype
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0115233_0115933	our production cost um can be maximum twelve and half euros
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0235657_0235767	fifty-crumpled
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0106383_0106722	okay i've got finance here now
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0045889_0046271	so the double click we'll do that just save them the trouble of reclining and cloning the audio on the menu
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0046515_0046621	sort of right
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0220232_0220665	or was is this nothing to with the project requirements is just that that's an added on feature
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0141020_0141277	okay
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0050347_0050518	oh well
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0045291_0045449	like and just think to have the deft there
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0006711_0006820	okay alright
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0023891_0024199	yeah basically all calculated yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0088855_0089231	so maybe because there's more space it's not kind of moving around
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0085982_0086172	to d the shape is uh
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0117565_0117771	this wave is only two days old
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0181283_0181419	the f. a. r. c.
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0216811_0217577	because we drop down menu but we we want all the information about the name the long name and the s and the users
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0087944_0088144	there's a bizarre animal animals
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0008138_0008820	uh in general the idea is that it should be something that it could be something that is not difficult to use
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0129552_0130090	and then functionality um i think you did a really good job on function and functionality
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0212327_0212444	yeah it was
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0043307_0044180	have just got the the power going to the infrared bar the chip and the uh uh interface um
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0068232_0068607	do you mean just the yeah but it's not gonna take very long
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0190674_0191003	um something like that should reduce the size of it
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0015168_0015754	this thing we are here uh um design uh is a new remote control
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0058705_0058934	also a lot or as like twenty five
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0174621_0174748	uh blank cool
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0156462_0156642	and evaluation of the
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0192791_0192913	you do need to have a key for it
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0068974_0069596	uh everybody knows it so uh you don't have to change that
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0089817_0090047	i think we should discuss that
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0099946_0100175	it's hard to tell whether it was a a transcription or whatever
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0117268_0117552	and show the the prototype to convert the search groups
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0110866_0111006	mm yes
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0182347_0182533	mm no it's difficult
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0143082_0143247	okay
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0112478_0112878	and that comes with a whole load of high lighting extra as well
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0233998_0234346	yeah
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0116878_0117215	let's have uh discussion on the control functions
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0199631_0199794	it just like what
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0098888_0099364	thinking sometimes in a case like a run across um in other languages
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0018302_0018699	so that's what we've just everlick all to you
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0060321_0060809	so it's to be yeah we had to buy one
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0023970_0024180	is it only gonna tell us we've gone wrong anyway
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0088279_0088765	yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0172417_0172825	or we have to make a left uh
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0127211_0128210	because you're gonna get an email and our mi s. e. l. s. i. l. s. i. l. s. i. l. s. i. l. s. i. l. s. i. l. s. i. l. s. i. l. s. i. l. s. i. l. s. i. l. s. i. l. s. i. l. s. i. l. s. i. l. s. i. l. s. i. l. s. i. l. s. i. l. s. i. l. s. i. l. s. i. l. s. i. l. s. i. l. s. i. l. s. i. l. s. i. l. s. i. l. s. i. l. s. i. l. s.
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0177578_0177728	yeah of course that we can
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0255215_0255501	uh you're just saying it to
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0042533_0042730	people with less means
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0119772_0119940	uh that was completely rubbish
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0004703_0004842	welcome
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0227763_0228698	um that seems to make sense but if it turns out that it's huge expensive we'd have to cut down somewhere else then it's worth thinking about
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0147540_0148015	they n no yeah but you've p minus three plastic two
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0103842_0104599	and just doesn't let you save certain things and it's just kind of to to do a different kind of to go to a different window
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0095602_0095807	yes no that's important
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0167730_0167888	um yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0213692_0214036	are we gonna steal our ideas and sell it
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0006588_0006734	okay
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0034045_0034226	in the room
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0016636_0017055	there should be extra features like lit buttons maybe a beep
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0169762_0169980	you can make a banana shape two
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0233005_0233184	documenting station
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0042160_0042326	so they change out
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0069493_0069749	let's take it to the next job
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0032877_0033282	are you supposed to wave off that or okay
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0215704_0216048	and the topic it says is well to wellcome to welcome to our browser
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0087539_0087996	okay we had looks and voice recognition
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0106053_0106854	uh i was a bit worried about when well when he talked about this with the f file missing wireless files
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0023119_0023309	well well we could have both but
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0066729_0067250	so this is a jobbaby unique remote control and it's impossible to immit place or lose
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0106555_0106792	well we can put the logo in here yeah
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0020965_0021091	but you already knew that
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0151464_0151692	okay
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0084719_0085603	um i mean just to try and i mean for us to be able to do something that we can include with your thing so so we yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0133154_0133380	uh a bit uh
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0182581_0182878	hundreds of fades
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0162741_0162952	uh is it functional
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0045439_0045574	speaky calibrated
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0081365_0081509	what about gramping and grammats
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0181663_0182241	so then i can just sort a trade-off and figure what objects they are and bring them in here
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0213084_0213742	and finally the body should be detachable maybe ch you can change the bottom of the case the case out
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0130408_0130522	and you have more pictures
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0193828_0194709	uh just the single curve because maybe c curve is pretty good to put the the screen in
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0028614_0028945	i had a play with it um yesterday
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0094088_0094233	would that's a hazard too
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0106575_0107074	i still can't make it run t. v. t. from j. v.
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0146055_0146174	yeah you might be right
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0099959_0100154	that doesn't take too long now
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0190501_0191179	yeah but we we were told we were told we were told we were told we were told we were told we were told we were told we were told we were told we were told we were told we were told we were told we were told we were told we were told we were told we were told we were told we were told we were told we were told we were told we were told we were told we were told we were told we were told we were told we were told we were told we were told we were told we were told we were told we were told we were told we were told we were told we were told we were told we were told we were told we were told we were told we were told we were told we were told we were told we were told we were told we were told we were told we were told we were told we were told we were told we were told we were told we were told we were told we were told we were told we were told we
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0068459_0068569	the touch
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0184719_0184848	are the cost within budget
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0114688_0114846	yeah right
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0154766_0155184	uh yes i would like to include this feature which is called voice recognition
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0022781_0022916	yeah that's right
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0140886_0141138	uh uh he uh he should not be hung in any way
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0034196_0034711	how the remote looks like so that it is scalable it is attractive to customers
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0174008_0174408	and that generally it would be a bit creative but it would give you a score
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0050845_0051764	the design should minimize r. s. i. and be easy to locate and we were still um a slightly embarrassed as to whether to use voice recognition there
AMI_TS3003a_H01_MTD011UID_0120696_0120802	five minutes okay
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0092912_0093190	spend too much time in front of it i think
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0047777_0048030	that would be the easiest way to the yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0094354_0094603	if you if you see how thin the tracks are
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0048126_0048468	uh yeah doesn't look what i wanted it to be
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0250776_0250894	or if we could try one
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0164816_0165230	right colourful trendy design and strong
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0030288_0030916	um it should have a fruit and vegetable design and should have a soft feel
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0210623_0210881	but i think but you were saying that that's quite
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0194339_0195069	because as soon as they've got loaded their first meeting they they can they can browse through that quite nicely
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0179398_0179899	and uh i think we are are happy with the meals we used
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0096156_0096516	yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0125507_0125757	so if you don't want to use it you just don't use it
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0036524_0036731	they are not really very interesting in features
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0088539_0088654	let's not
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0070776_0071251	yeah or even just have buttons on it talk boxes or something on a tool bar for that window
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0106846_0106986	oh just be mm
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0115913_0116369	as if if they would if people would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0029782_0030242	um we don't really know how to evaluate the speech recognition in to the browsing in to the browsing
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0098719_0099113	you don't want a swing before you can watch television
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0108805_0109267	that's a job
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0042120_0042597	yeah and uh i have to think on the spat of uh things that is
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0238898_0239158	great
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0032507_0032731	um mean it's like a nice thing
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0017486_0018262	um the speak i'm the data processing is fine but i would don't necessarily want to do the the the the the gobble for it
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0205664_0206292	was it clear with everybody had to do uh considering their rolls and functions
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0219181_0219500	i think i've got minutes for two of the meetings and the
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0170443_0170561	mm
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0145405_0145518	okay
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0159599_0160018	have you got people we had for us or what you're thinking and when
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0199280_0199424	yeah
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0171259_0171654	uh our next meeting will be in thirty minutes
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0075002_0075156	particle wise okay
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0081521_0081896	you mean to say with less than one
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0215998_0216302	it's easier to uh share it with uh another person
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0089624_0089850	i think it's uh different as well but
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0175288_0175809	you will receive specific indications will be sent to you by your coach
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0192189_0192592	so there's not uh really a decision to be made there um
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0066537_0066801	i'll do this i'll do that
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0080297_0080874	just one wanna find what kind of projects that was were that um for the others
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0234815_0235146	just but it's i think in that case it's the right corporate
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0177991_0178153	because i think that's uh
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0114834_0115187	was it regular chip on print and
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0200613_0201118	and new f television program's coming up but nobody giving a much earlier to this
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0191761_0191972	yeah
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0142809_0142949	yeah okay
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0022276_0022645	right different types of design that we're gonna be concerned with that we're gonna be
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0127782_0128591	what is um attractive to a trendy university and what is it attractive to a reactive society i don't know you get the idea
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0093820_0094017	but how would this scroll wheel work
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0073824_0074169	that it that the price is a good price
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0058085_0058757	yeah yeah saying that yeah about seventeen t seventeen t seventeen t seventeen t seventeen t seventeen t seventeen t seventeen t seventeen t seventeen t seventeen t seventeen t seventeen t seventeen t seventeen t seventeen t seventeen t seventeen t seventeen t seventeen t seventeen t seventeen t seventeen t seventeen t seventeen t seventeen t seventeen t seventeen t seventeen t seventeen t seventeen t seventeen t seventeen t seventeen t seventeen t seventeen t seventeen t seventeen t seventeen t seventeen t seventeen t seventeen t seventeen t seventeen t seventeen t seventeen t seventeen t seventeen t seventeen t seventeen t seventeen t seventeen t seventeen t seventeen t seventeen t seventeen t seventeen t seventeen t seventeen t seventeen t seventeen t seventeen t seventeen t seventeen t sevent
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0130210_0130370	yeah that's true
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0233769_0233929	uh i i i thing
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0023745_0024214	that's just cut out the little man
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0092561_0092947	and finally last but not least easy to lock
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0062662_0062874	because they use them quite frequently and watch
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0041033_0041181	then this is on
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0148167_0148477	i think that's a good idea as well especially for the subtitle
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0030899_0031139	to just some way to sort of level that information
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0050630_0050771	i think we have to keep that
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0056905_0057415	should we i don't know what we think about our things that we have to together
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0143963_0144215	although on the filter it's too big it's too big
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0051054_0051832	and in order to make it realistically saleable we've got a shop in the learning curve make sure it's really innovative and easy to use
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0081248_0081582	actually just to clarify last week we were talking about our search results
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0201135_0201925	if we want um uh propagation with uh for example the telephone for elderly people we can
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0019599_0019852	and how it would work you press the button
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0233929_0234196	um and i'll be able to not answer them
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0026563_0027101	and i'll be coming to you to tell me what's gonna make somebody take out their wallit you know
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0182770_0183332	like just to say okay well here you know everything is basic and set up and then just yeah just jump right in
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0035911_0036174	oh alright okay
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0032413_0032773	it's your best friend in you can talk to a dog it can be a bit frustrating
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0020047_0020887	and as i said on the slide they're concluding the industrial engineering about that and the other thing is really gonna be as important as important as important as important
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0059834_0060386	i mean the amount the amount of probably moving around you'd be doing all the time would would charge it up
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0144422_0144689	when i feel like the consumer is never going to do anything about the battery and or
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0105794_0105945	mm
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0144689_0144939	it's international nobody looks into the battery
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0025597_0026145	uh for uh yeah shifting up in uh on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on t on
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0212007_0212165	mm-hmm
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0189656_0189882	do we have some time left
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0035790_0036251	uh these functions we don't have anything to do with only undo you can undo a little bit
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0071927_0072435	and then you can even do it automatically or you can just hard code and say look get me the data
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0078888_0079032	that would really work
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0091895_0092155	because then we said ten buttons
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0088191_0088855	maybe because it's with the size that we've got it's quite small but with the amount of stuff we've put together on it isn't that much
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0087143_0087685	a kind of uh a touch screen um and it's uh for
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0146533_0146683	yeah
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0007276_0007726	uh now we're going um into the functional design
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0145782_0146250	are we have to be really great and it has to come out before the others
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0019391_0019703	can you create a product
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0149964_0150225	any other holes they could give us
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0050682_0050792	well i don't know what that means
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0225935_0226310	what preference do we want it to be that we might come round to market research at some point to see what people want
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0142837_0143107	uh it's gonna be a lot of work if we're going to have to look into anything like this
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0165863_0166384	representation of certain bar patterns which i already explained example the volume and channel controls
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0046605_0046933	well it might come to
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0049787_0050177	you can use this pen by holding it like a little child
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0235728_0236002	fifty-twenty-twenty-twenty-twenty-twenty-twenty-twenty-twenty-twenty-twenty-twenty-twenty-twenty-twenty-twenty-twenty-twenty-twenty-twenty-twenty-twenty-twenty-twenty-twenty-twenty-twenty-twenty-twenty-twenty-twenty-twenty-twenty-twenty-twenty-twenty-twenty-twenty-twenty-twenty-twenty-twenty-twenty-twenty-twenty-twenty-twenty-twenty-twenty-twenty-twenty-twenty-twenty-twenty-twenty-twenty-twenty-twenty-twenty-twenty-twenty-twenty-twenty-twenty-twenty-twenty-twenty
AMI_TS3003a_H02_MTD0010ID_0058364_0058516	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0076625_0076783	so okay
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0021791_0021898	yeah
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0194469_0194768	tracking station l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0213571_0214400	so the only thing that comes up when you finish is a um when you start it's just one window like that and it's got all the search stuff like down there
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0184614_0184842	rather than having to email you
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0076864_0077108	pollution play
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0161282_0162274	i just say what did so far and and i'm gonna do and some p some miscellaneous
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0012264_0012897	so we have to see if it fits within the twelve and a half euro per remote
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0083585_0084194	yeah well yeah well that has been a that has been a limitation so that's that's unfortunate and useless point now
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0154016_0154252	we're planning on having a big party on the twenty first
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0133009_0133455	and then we get to the point of the case
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0093019_0093692	this is all the uh technical uh electronic electronic components which which we have to use in a remote controller
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0158314_0158496	they are a few but in general not
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0149964_0150187	the uh tempest in vestigial documentation
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0008872_0009062	mm-hmm
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0034874_0035285	um they like to use new f new functions
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0111480_0111676	so i am not sure what it's call now
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0214736_0215214	um and if you've got the meeting screen in question now
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0168763_0169041	and if you have less buttons you can do a lot more with
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0173296_0173446	how did you find it
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0242163_0242325	even if it were there covers
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0085470_0085653	yeah that's what we need yeah
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0047965_0048737	okay so my personal preferences in this um project are in this um project are really have to concentrate on the screen
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0099902_0100259	that's i guess that's why we have a separate speech lab
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0075916_0076308	do you get a bit of where but don't calculate they have a battery in them as well
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0211382_0211679	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0109343_0109760	i think it was just like whenever we implement one of these interfaces for this particular type of window
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0152773_0153143	maybe that's us then not um
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0019412_0019547	and the company logo
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0116827_0117229	so if that would increase the price for which we're selling our remote control
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0009911_0010221	uh so i just let's get started
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0130060_0130210	yeah that's true
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0192679_0193086	like if they are looking for personal and professional personal working group whatever
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0124736_0125544	to get the data for example to get the summarization data you have to search for i i d s or something
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0164659_0164887	that would be so useful
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0087126_0087445	there is it
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0113995_0114217	um it might have influenced our choice
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0085854_0085988	yeah so we can plug in and
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0099496_0099666	yeah just a blank sheet
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0209080_0209463	this would definitely be different and enough i just wanted if anybody could come up with some thing even more
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0207042_0207490	because uh maybe your hand is in the way if you have to display here
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0191133_0191290	oh we haven't got k. d.
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0083172_0083306	okay
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0020670_0021549	it would be sort of inner set into the into the top and the buttons at the bottom would so it would be fully closed
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0206842_0207000	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0025267_0025508	um
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0059159_0059383	have you taken any more of a look at it
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0172871_0173724	and uh the user. d. is supposed to uh come up with a user interface design
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0125432_0125558	oh what wot
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0083208_0083491	that thotherwise it's just sort of hard plastic
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0197610_0198058	been on what you did the last time
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0219563_0219865	okay you're just looking for one specific speaker right
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0203687_0203961	and i think it's wonderful that our company so ar in d d base
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0150789_0151461	if they see this design then they only five buttons and but we will see
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0194615_0194841	well i think we can only a fox
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0033769_0034754	yeah that well you can you can get the sort of scientifically rounded ones but i just wanting about power consumption and how much you need to send the data
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0265179_0265811	it just doesn't you're looking for that term and relevance is kind of irrelevant because if the term shows up it shows up
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0213744_0213984	maybe somen'll write down and paint n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n't n'
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0017291_0017511	so we've got forty minutes for all of it
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0104111_0104351	yeah it's pretty skinny
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0017284_0018010	should like to see a timer and or alarm function
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0027329_0027798	i mean so that things are all modern i mean it would be good idea if we used that same idea for anything else we do
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0028819_0029177	but i think you know it already by yourself
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0136194_0136389	yeah yeah
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0083464_0083927	so that's a problem of of any design modifications you you come up with
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0117552_0118356	we don't want somebody to suddenly come to us and tell us this button is tactical and you know some child will solve it and then we won't sell any
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0042884_0043116	it runs it much faster than even i do it here
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0106240_0106856	our control is only going to be for t. v. it's not going to be uh combine control
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0137707_0137976	we have to cut costs
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0155506_0155799	because we've done all the backround work to go for that if they want to
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0000020_0000483	hey up there
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0115991_0116432	night object model i think that's true
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0120470_0120896	but it it could be time consuming like if they are ten documents that hit with this in
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0163365_0163504	mm
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0056045_0056157	do you mean single channel
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0111299_0112231	and uh it it was plainly generalized by going to generate to jerry java doc and it just wanted to spat it all out and they didn't really bother to
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0113394_0114347	um yeah i guess i mean it was a good point you had that like collaborating with with the phone things
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0006547_0006729	so maybe we miss start with you
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0163055_0163217	okay
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0071212_0071434	well it's finished it's going to get confused anyway it'll get confused
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0012134_0012611	yeah is opening questions tool training well
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0243115_0243612	i mean i think i'm gonna do quite a bit of work this week so i have probably more to talk about
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0099449_0099697	i can tell you what i've done in s. v. t.
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0091705_0091985	i think by default they are i think really
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0072104_0072410	okay and now i'm supposed to have one yeah
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0116197_0116303	mm-hmm
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0120774_0121027	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0091142_0091801	but if you don't then it won't yeah it says okay okay you have got all sorts of you can use that
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0000358_0000538	yeah exactly yeah yeah yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0148554_0148713	that's right
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0164731_0165115	yeah i'll get behind the camera yeah pretty quick
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0134440_0134932	and singe curve you have to have a different uh different mission then a flat one
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0052876_0053288	sometimes we have an awareness is a big one that comes up all the time yes no questions
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0023928_0024337	well in uh i guess in in in meeting brainstorming one point one
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0047249_0047547	now the connection of the criteria as we saw and our previous meeting
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0124688_0124836	next one
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0154007_0154164	did you like for the session of final report
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0144286_0144428	wow you don't need that
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0088899_0089550	which basically has these contacts that are really close together and then when you press down on the rubber button
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0256480_0256648	well that's what i thought when you said that
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0123724_0123835	yeah like
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0097550_0097667	a rubber
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0095217_0095416	um scroll
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0016519_0016699	so maybe you wanna make some notes of that
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0033357_0033549	i don't know uh get to that later
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0208684_0209080	we looked at those remotes i mean the are kind of a normal very similar looking things
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0282576_0282773	yeah
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0188355_0188928	it might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it which would explain a button if you press it
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0084553_0084817	you you wouldn't lose it so much
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0090047_0090706	um for the case uh the supplement and the buttons really depends on the designer
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0078855_0079091	oh it's boring it's strange
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0116826_0117456	so i'm just thinking if it's kinda like you're saying you have to have a new object right
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0173310_0173625	cool
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0126120_0126533	but that will mean that you can only do things on actually now you have to think things on
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0004479_0004718	um how uh how we're doing
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0011216_0012023	we decided it wasn't important to reflect the company's image in our product we put function in electronics you know that kind of thing
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0141247_0141500	i thought it said ten i thought it said twenty five
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0110905_0111510	if yeah and if you've got if you've got uh a scie box uh one of the scie boxes now
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0121865_0122367	use to find it needs to be something that you don't lose when you were saying wiggling
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0035432_0035654	be interested to see what our design people make of that
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0177235_0177373	that was
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0124381_0124649	uh that's the laptops
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0019509_0019685	so b but that's yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0095977_0096116	oh
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0135352_0135967	no no the the the the scrolling was a different like you can go for s switches like buttons or sliders
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0055337_0055442	but please next say
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0082502_0083092	or do we want them all in one paint with like an ikon or different colour or something to integrate what type of result they are
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0101685_0101792	yeah yeah
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0091369_0091737	or what about kind of a double function
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0133645_0133757	that's good to remember
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0019703_0020121	dopey dopey dopey dopey dopey dopey dopey dopey dopey dopey dopey dopey dopey dopey dopey dopey dopey dopey dopey dopey dopey dopey dopey dopey dopey dopey dopey dopey dopey dopey dopey dopey dopey dopey dopey dopey dopey dopey dopey dopey dopey dopey dopey dopey dopey dopey dopey dopey dopey dopey dopey dopey dopey dopey dopey dopey dopey dopey dopey dopey dopey dopey dopey dopey dopey dopey dope
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0158991_0159180	and you can just yeah uh click it in
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0095856_0096061	and then you've got the wrong number then you push it
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0116540_0116682	okay
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0159488_0159909	uh sort of but then the main idea was more like to to speak it up and speak the set up
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0161402_0161533	that would just be nice extra
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0075146_0075269	okay yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0216954_0217203	i think the selection is the twenty five pounds
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0223739_0224192	was there anything else there that we in the new project requirements
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0025379_0025658	yeah well i mean it's up to you if you wanna keep going with that
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0147775_0147937	yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0164949_0165076	and the load is
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0232000_0232366	some sort of feathers which updated dynamically depending on what you've got highlighted
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0038453_0038660	just the normal play button
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0004152_0004342	get to this
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0213100_0213867	so you could have like signature ones for younger people and sleek ones and sleek ones and
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0091621_0091739	okay
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0130623_0130801	you've got a a a much more mobile remote
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0256144_0256292	similar of the project
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0176696_0176832	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0143725_0143963	i dunno do we do we don't want to have to do that right
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0192972_0193082	it's got a lot of download but
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0089579_0090048	and uh it should be with uh um equivalent with titanium and alloy
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0072755_0073010	losing one digital plane that's okay
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0225026_0225240	uh you can save this one in the
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0051484_0051863	thr
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0177666_0177789	alright true
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0126238_0126970	uh if we put a lot of effort in those we can make a remote control with the just two or three buttons
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0164998_0165536	if our company is if it is easily recognisable that are our company made it
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0198979_0199684	yeah well you just you just scroll down the list and find your favourite one
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0287945_0288070	tik
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0184190_0184550	not for such simple functions because we're focusing on that yes okay
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0156418_0156912	if you if yeah if you have like buttons that appear on the screen and this l. c. d. screen
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0153591_0153741	this is on uh i i
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0281067_0281627	yeah there are only seventy five but they are seventy five five meetings
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0232098_0232225	alternatives with the button
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0100916_0101130	sure but yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0256421_0256688	are we supposed to go into our own rooms again
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0191260_0191791	mm we we well we can get in through the through the the card the card
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0053683_0053812	oh yeah yeah
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0050176_0050322	uh easy or right okay
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0001232_0001522	so what do we need to talk about
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0082937_0083405	yeah my grind is that you're better than me using teletext so
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0269767_0270631	well you could do it and overwrite it by the you g you could just inform the ranking if it doesn't show up together
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0056139_0056775	um i've been looking at that uh uh you're interested uh of it
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0014375_0014502	all of you
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0164442_0165203	so have the um the volume and the programme things like that on the lower side
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0108360_0109058	but it feels like it's it's a java code more than anything else
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0172320_0172808	can i just run this past you all again as to me i don't mean to quickly jump from one subject to another
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0046331_0046436	mm-hmm
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0118948_0119275	so that's leads is to our little discussion
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0031087_0031550	there's the um audio settings video settings and channel settings buttons
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0098073_0098582	so how do we feel about this
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0105088_0105449	that is the use of transtia transtia transmitter we which we use in the remote control
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0140877_0141040	that's a battery state
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0042623_0042742	into the method
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0037935_0038266	but put it under changes since the initial specification
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0207456_0207592	yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0188570_0188695	the transcriber or whatever is
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0093287_0093764	alright well i've been uh up and doing some ramp up and downs for the speech recognition which is good
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0044882_0045291	and just show up the the previously established instances of that topic in the meeting
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0042869_0043119	yeah after all use remote control
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0040011_0040261	so okay
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0145444_0145718	but if you take away the voice recognition then you've got it
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0077822_0077961	excellent
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0156213_0156360	i think if you if you only l
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0148526_0148668	exactly me too
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0052255_0052654	yeah and that's good stuff
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0036739_0036844	yeah
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0068849_0069212	i think you all did you get uh notifications on your computer for this
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0226030_0226150	okay
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0117863_0117973	alright
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0003189_0003551	that's possible and this time of day
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0047771_0047964	so there is not much to uh
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0208960_0209296	i think it was just the product just the production cost of the film
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0015184_0015707	we're gonna be we're touching on all that although the other part for the process and putting screen shots and all the rest yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0005038_0005142	so yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0065308_0065495	uh-uh-uh-uh
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0042611_0042816	actually yeah like uh another common thing
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0045420_0046093	if we see i don't know if i feel directly so just grab me if you see uh something wrong
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0183640_0183894	okay that's okay
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0091683_0091941	no no it's it's not well readable
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0121071_0121245	would you wanted total free screen
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0040963_0041128	so yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0073933_0074457	well have symbols so that that the user really knows you know and doesn't have to first learn it
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0103711_0104097	yeah but i think that's that is a big advantage for
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0060622_0061042	would you do the summarization as you popularize it
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0012023_0012947	um our budget would have to effect um try not to reflect our budget um that we might
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0090467_0090932	um but then you can't see all of them at the same time and it's just like
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0175287_0175410	think it's uh seven
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0065609_0066132	adding those up we've got six and a five eleven determined by four is what
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0285850_0286022	well we'll discuss it again on friday
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0055123_0055827	that is true because they put a new paper or they put it behind the plan or we know whatever
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0107578_0107880	whenever the t. v. is on remote control will have a light
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0157652_0158052	did you wanna meet before we talk to steve next week
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0117284_0117607	could you go back to that slide where she had that s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0073665_0073815	there's always stuff in the washing machine anyway
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0081185_0081594	uh whops
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0098982_0099792	you combine a specific connection that means when you when you press a button that will be uh a s small secure underneath the button
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0020378_0021157	that is it can be industrial work and then at the meeting we will discuss what uh we have come up with
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0158747_0158964	are they going to really quibble about t. p.
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0023549_0023655	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0054797_0055107	you give it an number and it'll give you the touch where ever for each person
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0233013_0233294	we can do all of that without even going anywhere near enough
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0124992_0125139	it's not too small though i don't think
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0070404_0071261	uh the these these two are these two are to uh scroll the program channels and these two are to uh scroll the program channels
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0131716_0131893	so that's a pretty handy uh
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0124267_0124755	is not around this week is this why i think that's why we didn't have the the meeting
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0073336_0073698	well yeah just the one thing that's like the action for loading up the search thing
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0219105_0219240	drop down is different not
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0052691_0052920	oh right okay i'm not good at it
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0029410_0029595	but i'm never on line on morning
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0137498_0138269	we don't have a lot of time left and we will still have to make a decision and the marketing expert has to present her a thing
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0206073_0206264	yeah i did touch up with that but yeah cool
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0162868_0163243	you if th if we just use the shell as an example again you open that
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0149671_0149979	oh we have three
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0129104_0129298	yes but it's not the biggest part of the
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0051365_0051759	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0099650_0099878	yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0094603_0095211	you could you could put them virtually right next to each other and have a much smoother switch on each one
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0031175_0031708	i like the suggestions to be really specific so that we'll have a list of things we can cross off
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0205778_0205904	it's mandatory
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0085733_0086046	um so it'll be on the search window before the search window
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0199088_0199348	yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0148079_0148241	keep thinking the same
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0168924_0169280	just something like uh hedberg university
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0166372_0166561	project evaluation
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0120575_0120691	it's a bubble of text
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0107820_0108083	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0170510_0170929	i think so with our l. c. d. screen docking station scroll buttons
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0076581_0077006	of transcript without the deflector with a deflector deflector
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0106163_0106420	but if you push the uh teletext button and then
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0167959_0168230	perhaps a true compressed noise
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0177559_0178451	um yeah maybe you wanna do um left handed um yeah one left click um high lights the the result in what ever you've got open
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0007291_0007454	yeah mine isn't stuck to date either
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0066273_0066537	i mean you wrote down the words and the ideas as
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0017650_0017791	okay yeah go fast
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0180861_0181069	no it's not very handy i think
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0023326_0023877	so put it in the top section rather than the bottom section s because it's the top part that's okay
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0074373_0074971	good point because we need the symbols 'cause we're going into an international market we can't have anything that's language dependent
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0106975_0107255	maybe i'll try
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0137830_0138232	yes and as j. j. w. said the buttons can be uh uh
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0095628_0096094	then also we can if it is a rechargeable one then people can use it for a long time
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0140434_0140639	it's not a lot though
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0103624_0103767	yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0162068_0162501	anybody else have any other comments or any other things that we feel we should evaluate
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0022728_0023525	and i've convinced some additional trend watchers after the original trend watchers returned about what the
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0209312_0209994	so it looks well it looks like it's gonna be fifty percent profit you've still got all of the overheads to come out of that
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0067023_0067170	one gear has got five joints
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0136783_0137172	so i think it's better we go for uh normal buttons
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0131930_0132233	i don't think it's gonna take long to to produce anywhere
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0138886_0139061	i am agreeing with the utility
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0012470_0012730	actually for that i was just copying the one string to the other document
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0135186_0135590	so if certain you know if it's a property word
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0078439_0078909	but would it make the remote more useful for elderly people
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0092292_0092417	maybe yeah yeah
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0070024_0070319	it's my creative uh creative about the dome
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0045399_0045889	that you wanna see per topic you wanna see which one it's speaking most something like that
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0100849_0100972	kay
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0009682_0009830	um property four i believe
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0108922_0109064	but you want
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0009014_0009424	so this is our project documents folder
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0046985_0047241	it's got a good interface and is useful
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0182876_0183163	do the p. d. switch it to post-processing which back to p. d. off and then
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0091530_0091813	should told me i could just change it here and then it would
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0046472_0047301	sometimes if if if uh uh a video he gets a telephone call and if he wants he doesn't want to switch off the uh t. v.
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0187904_0188353	thought we would have a lot of priority after this
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0155341_0156222	but suppose even even calculating the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0206619_0207514	um our costs are below budget with recognition that they the budget has been increased but i don't know what do you think
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0220271_0220456	but then yeah as i said how did you do
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0022694_0023520	uh that's just uh as the normal uh remote controls uh so um
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0153385_0153583	artificial intelligence and the seventh and eighth versions
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0141783_0141896	change the case
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0003057_0003385	well i've got a brush and which works
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0003404_0003804	good start
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0018493_0018818	you could see the time you know what show they want to watch
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0074427_0074693	i did it in my dictionary just uh just do that yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0022303_0022415	well oh yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0207817_0207928	hmm
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0114513_0115039	well change it to free
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0130070_0130315	what the remote control is like
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0119829_0119979	righting it back to a map
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0087957_0088348	and it should be relevant to hi as well as uh low temperatures
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0038191_0038361	yeah that's that easy
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0018314_0018423	yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0117659_0117763	okay okay
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0078492_0079300	no that's primarily in relation to our market research findings about the spongy texture to the experimental and the fruit and vegetable design colours
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0013037_0013522	and she was challenged on that point
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0096272_0097238	uh thirty four percent of people take that they take too much time to learn to use and i think that time in with the um the previous finding of people only using ten percent of the buttons
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0142112_0142400	okay so the highest we've got is the electronics here
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0132517_0132635	and then yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0193279_0193562	actually we're asking steve about that whether we can get in there
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0061278_0061447	yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0094685_0094872	okay one
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0026233_0026456	okay
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0173660_0174199	and correct back any like uh things that i thought was wrong in the english language
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0130033_0130153	interface
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0103286_0103406	um
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0184179_0184486	just uh you're using um
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0093342_0093493	ah that's yeah
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0043656_0044399	now having use a remote control for years does anybody already have like an idea like things you didn't like with it
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0003664_0003952	minutes um we decided to use a kinetic chart
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0173304_0173568	yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0169712_0170288	no it's not um but i think if a wheel was kind of brought to the front about that
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0125288_0125530	yeah that's w and that's why i think we like
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0142505_0142623	yeah right
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0156649_0156753	we should have it done anyway
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0123581_0123733	just like
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0179851_0180014	if i think that's a free
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0062113_0062844	uh so um you got a lot uh de f uh device like a d. v. uh um television uh uh television
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0161756_0161905	innovative
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0051763_0052198	well i'll i'll check what it does on on um double click at the moment
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0039817_0039922	just for recognition
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0028023_0028142	um no
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0111483_0111596	yeah yeah yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0143817_0144241	i'm sorry i f um forgot to that um
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0222119_0222777	but an extended list of the of the meetings so you know you have b. d. r. w. whatever it was called a. w.
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0044970_0045542	now the um we we decided upon including including certain features and are remote
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0174199_0174381	yeah it's like no
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0155884_0156315	um just to ask whether we need to have the evaluation done for the demonstration
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0152829_0153239	i think uh that's very important we have a few buttons
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0119481_0119693	but it has a slightly flat bottom so it can see
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0219973_0220141	yeah pen is here on the table
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0222551_0222719	have we got this kind of meetings
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0058247_0058379	number two no
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0137251_0137367	you don't think so as well
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0164930_0165079	yeah maybe right
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0099112_0099725	or just what is it more like
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0002070_0002219	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0027852_0028436	it always makes me feel bad because when i go to bad at like one you're still on line
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0089554_0089817	but depends on what we want
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0141930_0142143	maybe it's possible uh possible uh
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0021965_0022709	and you can real cool that it can write it the object and then you call the objective and then they have all the information that they need all the information that they need
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0106964_0107498	well that could be just uh like the scroll to the a. scroll to the a. click scroll to a. click scroll to a. click scroll to a. click scroll to a. click scroll to a. click scroll to a. click scroll to a. click scroll to a. click scroll to a. click scroll to a. click scroll to a. click scroll to a. click scroll to a. click scroll to a. click scroll to a. click scroll to a. click scroll to a. click scroll to a. click scroll to a. click scroll to a. click scroll to a. click scroll to a. click scroll to a. click scroll to a. click scroll to a. click scroll to a. click scroll to a. click scroll to a. click scroll to a. click scroll to a. click scroll to a. click scroll to a. click scroll to a. click scroll to a. click scroll to a. click scroll to a. click
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0148581_0148982	i think that is still a kind of question mark is how we deal with that
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0103977_0104086	alright
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0072563_0073206	what are you winding to write that directly or what what do you wanna do with that
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0052524_0052865	it's just very quiet
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0021210_0021426	um i've done some research
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0036880_0037334	uh as i said about the a which batteries we're gonna choose
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0053386_0053794	um uh let's see
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0067786_0068008	the colours are very traditional
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0194299_0194531	i think that's a pretty nice score
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0025298_0025776	and we've got our user interface designer
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0230146_0230659	oh you can have a textbox there there as you go over them yeah as you go over them
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0068805_0069665	but if uh maybe you know how we could do the like from the uh extract words that you did
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0209880_0210323	uh then a few small things
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0050738_0051294	and we have also included two buttons for scrolling up and scrolling down the program channels
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0176364_0176543	oh right okay
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0049778_0049996	that's my trustworthy that's the first yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0013608_0013797	if you've got forty minutes
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0133367_0133778	and also the transcription files they've got the strip i don't know what it is
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0075541_0075679	no
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0116388_0116511	rubber yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0115184_0115431	well not like to load up like the thing is i think
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0030576_0030860	one's concerned with noise and one's concerned with potential participation
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0034797_0035557	just keep it simple and well well the document station and the small screen would be our main point of interest
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0097811_0098288	so if you scroll to a number and you wait a half second then it turns to that channel
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0071725_0071915	that they their expensive they don't
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0069749_0070202	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0132102_0132203	yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0113138_0113402	mm i don't have any mim information pricing
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0088968_0089266	but the it wouldn't be very robust
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0135087_0135349	i think this is a really easy one
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0066289_0066787	and then i changed it and then i ran the thing again you wouldn't ever be able to load the objects back up
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0159909_0160355	because an x. e. v. with the over the whole of the coffee was just not feasible
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0066792_0066942	pahs are nice
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0150982_0151470	so those are things maybe we wanna look at as far as saleable of the entity
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0087170_0087588	you were loading like a new corpus each time for each meeting but you're in the object
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0095738_0095924	but it might have it's cost in implementation
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0063991_0064404	so you've got the glossy one there and then here you can just have the top five in this meeting
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0061732_0062279	and so i just say one of the boxes is just exposed as this is my topic five dollar gadgets for the speaker
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0187038_0187139	so there would be this
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0024337_0025195	you can have a menu instead of a button
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0180192_0180428	yeah i think maybe we should do some research into
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0033821_0034404	i've prot it to see if it would write that it didn't write that long and then saw that alright yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0200781_0201493	is it v very difficult to make another a another gobbledy goblet but only for a gobbledy goblet
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0064655_0064779	next slide please
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0157389_0157688	is it twelve point five was it twelve point fifteen fifty
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0058954_0059174	we can just refer to this later can't we
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0123878_0124032	cool that's what people are
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0143413_0143544	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0202772_0202979	yeah because in the stats screen you can't have it
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0005935_0006681	and then when you go on the menu you can select a summary box which pops up and an audio player
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0129377_0129503	but uh well anyway yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0107692_0108376	but then again that would be that's just pretty much an old office for older people who don't even know what a scroll wheel is
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0154203_0154315	which one do you want to use
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0254517_0254873	i'll write um i'll write this meeting up and i'll send it to polly as well
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0063909_0064125	so the light sensor would activate the signal
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0251148_0251339	well it wouldn't be a long meeting then
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0208880_0209062	that's a symbolic uplift
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0017785_0018043	like the thing is i'm thinking even in the stuff that was treating i was treating
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0085700_0085982	and that you s you say that won't add too much to the budget
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0029852_0030249	um mostly to them were powered by some form of battery
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0085748_0086228	no we don't want something original
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0130326_0130868	and then you can apply it from the third or a second floor
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0038068_0038336	i think we should make a remote for the future
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0093454_0094252	um and probably we can also cut back on cost if we don't have so many functions actually on the remote control
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0163447_0163714	so this these are just some thoughts i have on it
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0085499_0085694	i don't think we've really touched on that all
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0163372_0163537	i think th that does make sense
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0098880_0099666	just just a quick thing about the um but what you were saying about the it doesn't need to be fashionable
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0005570_0005801	okay this is our last meeting
AMI_IS1009a_H01_FIO087_0053067_0053246	a different
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0272028_0272402	yeah just just disregard yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0164813_0165282	it would that was the whole point was th that was the whole point was this is your top one this is your top one this is your top one and this is your top one and this is your top one and this is your top one and this is your top one and this is your top one and this is your top one and this is your top one and this is your top one and this is your top one and this is your top one and this is your top one and this is your top one and this is your top one and this is your top one and this is your top one and this is your top one and this is your top one and this is your top one and this is your top one and this is your top one and this is your top one and this is your top one and this is your top one and this is your top one and this is your top one and this is your top one and this is your top one and this is your top one and this
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0151914_0152324	yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0120928_0121283	i want to be comfy and roundy so we we've got that
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0053017_0053235	um were you gonna like to continue up from that
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0208960_0209241	but mostly will probably want to go with the flag
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0063870_0064567	yeah uh yeah it'd probably put it to yeah two or three
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0107490_0107720	that's true
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0070718_0070863	you want your rating to be a two
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0054854_0055307	no this is uh a special special feature which we have included
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0026037_0026206	that's about the new remote control
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0140381_0140763	that it might be handy to put a battery status display on it
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0068484_0068929	i think it's it wants to draw uh another animal
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0065246_0065653	turn it up side down move it up up and down i really liked that
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0274305_0274557	oh that's sort of what it is yeah that's true
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0012309_0012442	oh right that's okay
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0114281_0114818	i think that that that tend to be the basis for the basis for the basis for the basis for the basis for the basis for the basis for the basis for the basis for the basis for the basis for the basis for the basis for the basis for the basis for the basis for the basis for the basis for the basis for the basis for the basis for the basis for the basis for the basis for the basis for the basis for the basis for the basis for the basis for the basis for the basis for the basis for the basis for the basis for the basis for the basis for the basis for the basis for the basis for the basis for the basis for the basis for the basis for the basis for the basis for the basis for the basis for the basis for the basis for the basis for the basis for the basis for the basis for the basis for the basis for the basis for the basis for the basis for the basis for the basis for the basis for the basis for the basis for the basis for
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0028670_0028789	so inadequate
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0078010_0078122	it's it was the whole thing
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0104986_0105181	if you push it three times
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0210877_0210998	why yeah
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0190040_0190371	and then if people really want more colours they can buy it separately
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0050792_0050952	do you know what w bad channel
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0100114_0100440	and the regular chip is not possible
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0093846_0093986	how to order
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0108818_0109508	so if you have any ideas or if you wanna draw anything on the whiteboard just ask and go ahead
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0162952_0163317	are there not too many functions uh an amount of functions
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0202466_0202569	to have for the start up
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0102431_0102558	i think we yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0142276_0142587	it's not a good firm
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0024903_0025738	um so i decided i'd have a look at what other people of designed and try to take some inspiration from that
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0039518_0039783	no
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0037960_0038448	okay now i'm gonna have to change what it was originally gonna be because that looks like a bicycle now so
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0153617_0153839	um how about the feel
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0007053_0007312	wow
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0190085_0190483	i'm actually borrowing from other areas it's you know bringing things from other areas
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0060504_0060724	we could just make it up
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0187627_0187906	do you want on the statutory screen yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0083679_0083990	thank you it's pull that closer a little bit
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0057900_0058505	yeah so this is one of the interface or one of the remote which has this voice voice voice
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0093518_0094012	the other thing is just t tacketing into mobile phone design features again
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0090085_0090281	so we guess we use one
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0174570_0174717	uh like other functions
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0188530_0188806	tinker in and tinker in and tinker in
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0124836_0125272	i mean that's gonna be that could be yeah
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0036262_0037062	and according to to to hierarchical management the it should only control the t. v.
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0158669_0158815	twenty five is now
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0157274_0157747	it is is that is that a part of the description to they want that information to they want that evaluation as part of the evaluation
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0147756_0148224	um i'm concerned with the the r. s. i. s. i. sh. i. sh. i. sh. i. sh. i. sh. i. sh. i. sh. i. sh. i. sh. i. sh. i. sh. i. sh. i. sh. i. sh. i. sh. i. sh. i. sh. i. sh. i. sh. i. sh. i. sh. i. sh. i. sh. i. sh. i. sh. i. sh. i. sh. i. sh. i. sh. i. sh. i. sh. i. sh. i. sh. i. sh. i. sh. i. sh. i. sh. i. sh. i. sh. i. sh. i. sh. i. sh. i. sh. i. sh. i. sh. i. sh.
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0118818_0118949	the double curved
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0207905_0208061	yeah so
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0187312_0187486	mm want to know
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0113883_0114458	so did we have a data for when we actually wanted the system done
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0123383_0123515	um
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0221477_0221637	i think it's a bug in the system
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0215162_0215553	that's easier to bit nice to handle
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0097468_0098059	the chip uh controls the infra red bubble and prf perhaps a normal bubble
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0062575_0063003	in in that moment it has a sensor it it gets a certain darkness
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0072892_0073178	but uh we're gonna have to navigate it down a little more
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0188848_0188969	that's different because
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0186520_0186655	the l. c. d. is not cheap
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0170208_0170330	mm
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0074001_0074203	yes which can be easily recognized
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0196786_0197287	well if they're part of b. d. b. d. working group they're gonna wanna look at b. d. b. d. ones and so they'll be different from that
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0079543_0080152	so i'm just thinking before i give it my rating you were limited in the use of materials for your prototype here
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0117608_0117718	something like that
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0174959_0175210	instead of uh f for less buttons
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0139867_0140423	just to explore our l. c. d. screen and a bit more
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0017917_0018314	um have you all seen the corner warp side already
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0053812_0053941	uh that's you
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0164267_0164756	and i think we all agree on the case we wanna have something uh maybe bright colourful
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0008861_0009603	um the transcription box has got a similar border button which doesn't do anything yet
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0040229_0040610	so i'm quite glad that it looks you know not too nice on one round or this kind of thing
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0042426_0042675	so this is the one
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0084199_0084349	and it should be reusable
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0060335_0061014	yeah no this is an interface for a chip uh for a remote uh uh which a chair can use
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0139184_0139773	so in even in the dart the user can no what buttons to use to switch on a particular channel
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0092623_0092786	although i'll i'll make up some m.
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0013878_0014055	the the left click or the right click
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0073271_0073416	so um
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0193869_0194233	should be fancy to fancy design easy to learn
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0282559_0283107	when it's twenty-eight even if we transform twenty-two do you crack off at ten do you ring them do what's the thrill
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0183727_0184471	i think we we did uh in more than one respect and uh so i think we did very well here
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0124769_0124899	maybe it's just a little bit
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0020995_0021224	um we've done some market research
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0083866_0084550	so you can quite easily if your text area is called area you just do area dot set high lights or something you know
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0145518_0145969	uh although it's gonna be do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0047355_0047814	you know how the menu's written but instead of like have a de facto de facto click
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0102255_0102357	yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0110496_0110920	but whether whether or because we'd have it in two separate units
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0132383_0133347	uh the remote should be comfortable and it should have as many buttons as possible for controlling different functions of the t. v. t. v. television
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0147297_0147426	this is not familiar for them
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0156251_0156713	so we can't we can't skip the display so uh we don't need it
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0024381_0024516	i know
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0076724_0076992	another question is like sorry
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0190169_0190674	but it doesn't really matter 'cause it never really runs out 'cause it lasts a long time one it's changed
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0027039_0028033	uh but um i thought in uh few meetings earlier we uh uh try to keep it uh simple
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0096094_0096748	so in that way we can cut the cost but uh that we have to make the battery as rechargeable one
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0075138_0075610	and you know spec you you will get specific um instructions for that
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0092783_0092912	yeah
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0050930_0051366	another thing is you have to be uh a bit slow
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0068745_0069236	no these the front buttons which are here are the mute buttons on both sides
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0080380_0080592	with menus yeah yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0154928_0155214	okay and second as already discussed with velvet
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0086443_0086588	by the way
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0076547_0076744	yeah i haven't i haven't i haven't i haven't i haven't i haven't i haven't i haven't i haven't i haven't i haven't i haven't i haven't i haven't i haven't i haven't i haven't i haven't i haven't i haven't i haven't i haven't i haven't i haven't i haven't i haven't i haven't i haven't i haven't i haven't i haven't i haven't i haven't i haven't i haven't i haven't i haven't i haven't i haven't i haven't i haven't i haven't i haven't i haven't i haven't i haven't i haven't i haven't i haven't i haven
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0063436_0063952	have an image in my mind and i just wanna see it on the thing and then can i see it on the thing and then
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0157287_0157809	because uh speech recognition like uh it it it has it's own uh um problems
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0066948_0067118	that's that's a really good good
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0193562_0193757	whether you're gonna get us an extract into the
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0202394_0202519	the room was yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0026919_0027039	okay
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0123298_0123436	um
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0029731_0030110	actually i don't know that no one is
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0104177_0104926	okay now i hope everybody has a little bit more in the functions we all have in what we are doing right now
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0064255_0064919	so popular as vladi and i would put it to simplify and i would make it as simple as possible
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0080874_0081304	so go in and high lights 'cause that's
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0150429_0150823	i did do it once i do have a job code that does it for something i don't know whether it works for this
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0049675_0050406	um the uh i found some uh something about uh speech uh recognition
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0183135_0183441	um did we need did we find new ideas
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0169656_0170315	oh if we had separate tasks that was so much interaction so much that we needed to um surround ourselves with other
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0029420_0029974	now we should point out that the first of those findings fancy look and feel is the most important
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0081658_0082025	and finally the project title he spoke about
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0124069_0124247	what does it mean if you put point five for that
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0141096_0141729	um then did have all that was sort of built in and just uh had some trouble getting it running properly
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0172030_0172181	is the design easy to use
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0104040_0104203	uh it's a bunch of variants
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0059545_0059671	ah the display okay
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0189054_0189228	what you could um
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0153159_0153266	yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0195514_0195759	because it's a bit it has a bit of a angle
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0220154_0220323	oh yeah yeah the wild one yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0098501_0098936	i think uh that is uh for for rubbers there is a yeah a key
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0137735_0138224	is that not make any difference if you clip off that square now does that make any difference
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0068777_0068895	okay
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0127901_0128111	on on on the remote
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0165633_0165800	that's gonna be quite a few pages
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0244396_0244498	i'd be uh
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0232559_0232680	i think it's time for us to
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0051832_0052603	we have to have as few buttons as possible because more buttons is more confusion so that's why i'm saying simplicity is good
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0133455_0134119	um which brings is a little bit back to market as well
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0049213_0049607	uh this is i can start from now
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0101994_0102510	that's an option we can then we're almost there
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0010093_0010200	alright so
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0072814_0073649	as we said we we have to make a profit also so we we can maybe go for a higher product m by fifty million by cash
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0193623_0193828	okay
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0085913_0086188	and if you use less buttons
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0103476_0103651	that's for
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0057092_0057577	uh by pressing down volume long or pressing down uh a number
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0020992_0021379	have in the talkative segmentation one
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0060429_0060744	uh it is
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0048445_0048674	here we have the single curved
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0142893_0143138	and they kind of respond to the turn of your body
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0181323_0181622	uh we're not gonna put anything okay just a thought
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0246996_0247596	uh although well i don't know 'cause it's the label and try to get some work done for the the laptop stuff
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0197899_0198437	think probably elderly people would be little bit b more careful with their remote controls and
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0246398_0246596	mm
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0215121_0215344	just bit more bit more fancy
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0141886_0142148	i don't incur you all to do the same
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0003721_0003846	okay
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0100488_0101105	and uh you only have to design a remote one and if you use high technology it comes back in every product
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0204238_0204421	yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0116994_0117621	so in spite of the fact that the fashion that comes off being plastic the fashion that comes off would be the rubber
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0130485_0130598	by the chair
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0042122_0042347	um the one present
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0241021_0241212	not right fun
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0215455_0215628	yeah maybe we could come up with some s.f.i.f.i.f.i.f.i.f.i.f.i.f.i.f.i.f.i.f.i.f.i.f.i.f.i.f.i.f.i.f.i.f.i.f.i.f.i.f.i.f.i.f.i.f.i.f.i.f.i.f.i.f.i.f.i.f.i.f.i.f.i.f.i.f.i.f.i.f.i.f.i.f.i.f.i.f.i.f.i.f.i.f.i.f.i.f.i.f.i.f.i.f.i.f
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0107984_0108254	you have to convert it to some sort of format i suppose
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0021934_0022335	um okay what are we going to do
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0142418_0142656	well it wasn't originally either
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0271207_0271446	yeah you do the net. t. s. and it doesn't stop together
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0256898_0257262	then we know who missed them or who is if you've done any
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0135305_0135407	oh yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0095345_0095469	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0017279_0017651	simple plus minus button
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0178399_0178669	then it didn't match 'cause it was just another idiom in feature
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0034749_0035495	and then if you i don't know click on that topic you'll get everything that's in that topic or whatever
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0153855_0154032	have a favor it to
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0139058_0139344	yeah to do um what type of scaffolding to do
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0098549_0098880	yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0099509_0099901	and then we have the interface push buttons
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0122353_0122857	i mean i thought we we'd just selectively selectively right the x-ray that we've got
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0069948_0070393	this brings the menu up on the screen and the orange ones are or
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0244241_0244628	so do we want to change this get this get this one earlier maybe
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0030163_0030404	it'd be nice to have it in kind of inte connect a little bit
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0132750_0133469	rubber buttons not titly little on big rubber buttons but what about i mean 'cause we've got to make it original
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0019400_0019512	um. f. and
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0190231_0190333	then it could crush it
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0129433_0129934	might do if figure for some of the more experimental oxygen oxygen gases and such like colours
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0193474_0193716	the bare board l. c. d. or
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0199279_0199946	that's very strange because your thumb is slightly up so they come up so here
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0177980_0178441	yeah you wanna you know just get together and think about the different types of search we could possibly do
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0257021_0257501	so can we just can we just represent fairly what we've been speaking about
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0008621_0009142	uh after that we have to come to a decision on remote control concepts
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0146528_0146951	the internal and external design is got to remain the same yes absolutely
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0095678_0095860	yeah small one
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0112622_0112798	how to use the scroll wheel
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0025097_0025633	people question uh indicated that their remote was uh was ugly
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0063476_0063721	b i mean that we can discuss that later you know
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0159803_0160156	it looks like we've got got ourselves a pretty good product
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0137664_0137928	so do you have to write it in the way that they wrote it is what we did
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0213286_0213663	so you rather want to have uh flip over
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0180749_0180961	we have the test that's true
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0022556_0022822	we had one hundred of these uh telesubjects
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0056602_0056712	so yeah
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0057676_0057871	when point four for something like that
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0039387_0039590	i know
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0058505_0058736	and less um you can't have it properly or something
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0053528_0054020	so which w you know suggest maybe you can suggest a few that which which would be interesting to lie
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0164008_0164164	seven page
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0027508_0027939	and fifty percent of the people indicated that their remote tend to get lost in their room
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0082252_0082379	mm
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0076079_0076247	maybe we should move to a different app
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0175844_0175990	oh and do we um
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0017532_0018012	so should we keep the same uh line up as uh last time
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0097238_0097521	it just can't be bothered to learn about the other functions
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0195222_0195447	yeah just jam it up of it
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0183919_0184252	and you just press the button and the front goes ringing
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0054362_0054579	uh yeah after to do real low
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0005194_0005672	the case materials could be soft rubbery changeable
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0159520_0160519	we have we have earlier it was mentioned about um for example elderly people who have limited functionality with their fingers in hands
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0203619_0203867	alright okay
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0018862_0019193	okay so should we start with the first presentation
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0279167_0279738	but you don't have any ranking system at the moment so if something is a a massive r har har har thing from t. v. d. f.
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0252792_0252904	three's better and five or six
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0109768_0109931	would that imply v. d. o. v. use
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0030633_0030899	i mean speaker caracterization in to i don't know
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0060809_0061392	so i suppose later if we want to undo the price we'd or is it going to make our product look a cheepy cheepy cheepy option
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0005140_0005279	yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0165682_0166106	yeah include some more buttons and uh yeah features
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0085663_0086259	uh but in my instructions i think it's that we were supposed to go to the board and do something
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0024509_0024960	um most important thing is the fancy design
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0143060_0143427	the interiors maybe your touch screen could be a better option for that
AMI_TS3003a_H02_MTD0010ID_0101447_0101812	are you just try something else
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0145395_0145574	yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0050494_0050799	how what kind of how long can you get out of that
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0085527_0085761	it's a pretty rare red one
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0003703_0003815	okay
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0137491_0137642	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0150288_0150408	this can be changed as well
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0083822_0084216	yeah but uh we have to stick to the twelve and a half euro
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0008382_0009196	um i'm sure uh the project manager and this is our first meeting supporting and profiting enough
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0081515_0081690	and there should be a chip mark
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0068080_0068370	i would give that a. three
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0164048_0164176	okay
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0132084_0132683	yeah yeah 'cause that's the i declare a very bad doesn't no
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0120733_0121028	mm
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0160229_0160992	i am the user and my family members are the user i will already record a uh question like
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0182307_0183125	there will be a customer service number thing that you can fone up and speak to and that way there's no call out charge out
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0129404_0129617	yeah yeah you don't really need to do much more with it
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0163317_0163740	and are a those functions that are their are they useful
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0078967_0079783	i don't think you'd think that it would well you know how long the standard double sided would last in or double sided would last
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0200585_0200849	i forgot
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0193086_0193671	i mean we just uh we could bring things down like that to that level of detail if we want
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0135848_0136057	one a. s. d.
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0128257_0128525	first as first step only return the meetings
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0222656_0223061	could i take it from the feedback you gave us from you from your report
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0134790_0135144	then you can do a massive amount of analysis on three people
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0030441_0031056	it just prints everything out in the in the in the shell as well like as it does everything i just kind of i guess that's de facto based on anyway
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0205234_0205344	okay
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0133891_0134149	single curve it's really easy to just fill in
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0130510_0130868	you need to use other
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0088627_0088837	well would certainly make a fancy design
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0094960_0095318	um first
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0117928_0118404	so you can see how the the yes know sort of variables across the age group there
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0148571_0149086	so what would the if we had the these fake topics what what would they look like
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0126889_0127431	because it will increase cost uh significantly uh effectively
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0126718_0126828	yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0135045_0135233	that would have to be a touch
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0109230_0110041	so it'll come up on the screen for the moment i haven't managed to fit it into a vegetal or whatever in java
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0061158_0062113	yeah uh i've been thinking about uh similar manager uh to put a lot of functions uh uh in one um and one uh remote control
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0091362_0091506	that might be maybe an idea
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0114442_0114592	to day wasn't it
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0158504_0158755	yeah that's what i'm thinking to yeah
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0115695_0116236	uh and also there are uh m refs uh sorry th there is a demo
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0062635_0063079	well that thing is basically though is someone can have five windows open at the same time probably not
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0033214_0033502	then these are uh this is the market
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0108608_0108739	can you go to the next slide please
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0177789_0177962	uh decide on that on over the weekend
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0162693_0163275	and beside that it's um if we're gonna focus on elderly people they'll have to adapt
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0191580_0192089	the if this this computer room in here the m. s. c. l. b. b. is in here
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0148964_0149212	patterns for chevy wheels
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0226653_0226788	smart button there it is
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0199278_0199452	maybe it doesn't handle a touch
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0201029_0201159	okay fine
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0082114_0082502	um do we want separate results uh for each of those
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0201065_0201541	well no i'm just getting back to sort of what could be on the the start up screen
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0014437_0014850	mm i'm not sure if we need the outline or the prototype
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0188370_0188958	yeah we we talked about kind of kinetic charging we have to decide on that would decide on whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether or whether
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0034072_0034535	now uh we are ready for the presentation of the prototype
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0145900_0146161	okay
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0090559_0090965	yeah i'd i'd i'd go for five actually 'cause
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0019778_0020295	on the representative the meetings and the meet and the information about both is concerned within each object
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0098268_0098462	uh but yes but
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0099725_0099959	alright
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0041757_0042217	um this is certainly something to take into account
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0207915_0208053	well you where you are
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0125139_0125328	at least it's not it's not too bad on that
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0042838_0043738	um alright now uh other things that i found out on in my record is that the complaints that people have about the remote controls that are out there now
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0158170_0158348	don't have
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0199316_0199966	because are we talking about elderly lively people or people from forty to eighty to eight
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0071824_0072571	um almost uh e all uh remote controls uh are using uh on off button on that place
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0249998_0250371	we've all got claw well three of us have claw twelve of us have claw
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0018894_0019151	yeah
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0072011_0072439	so w you have a working design and then a functional design
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0211713_0211898	i think we need to take the other box right
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0133368_0133554	i'm just thinking of like ten
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0244644_0244766	five more minutes
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0133165_0133775	that would be a good no i think that no that's a lot
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0002912_0003048	should you be able to understand me or not
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0061241_0061469	if you got no textual no
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0047031_0047163	so do you want to redo that then
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0076088_0076284	okay can we actually have it but it's
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0155734_0156064	so these are the two things we should come up with
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0155570_0155756	um maybe two
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0199452_0200023	if money permits we can adjust some features for some subgroups within that
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0022987_0023159	okay yeah see what you mean
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0058470_0058757	well if we're skipping the audio one then and then things that are easier
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0015365_0015769	so uh i suggest we take about seven minutes presentation
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0088088_0088254	supers meeting browser
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0150380_0150789	and it's uh it's less frightening i think
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0133822_0134090	we have not four years yeah
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0148961_0149228	so that nobody else comes late and use
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0177270_0177482	here is a little l. c. d. screen
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0202051_0202252	tarkata a real elegant people
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0056716_0056932	right
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0190238_0190469	just a small screen with two
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0194037_0194480	yeah it's only got its cramp but it would do quite good for a job but it would do quite good for a job
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0102253_0102750	cause i dunno um just now but i haven't played around it that much
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0010362_0010480	i can hold it like
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0053586_0053930	so this is one of the very important features a remote control can have
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0087192_0087460	we have the big yellow um maybe
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0055554_0055657	do we want it or not
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0166028_0166645	user interface concept uh interface interface interface
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0144537_0144643	but we should ask them
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0202399_0202522	it's not quite what we want really
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0177373_0177514	i had them worked out
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0118532_0118810	but that would also go for the l. c. d. screen then i guess
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0161877_0162283	you would be using your thumbs to press just like a mobile phone
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0026408_0026675	yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0031970_0032302	could that be can i intervene to ask a question there is that appropriate
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0018924_0019419	so it's like i don't know s unless i wanna do something with this in the future
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0131805_0132583	um and also for electronics we can use a simple and regular uh re uh or an advanced to chip on the front
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0098570_0098725	yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0119311_0119924	um well this is yeah but this is here the question was would you prefer it
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0077618_0077833	yeah i
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0182205_0182421	and we used the slide because it was better position
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0090855_0091354	but you wouldn't want to compare the result the tip one topic result with one specific result would you
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0098896_0099689	um the latest modification of the thirty five and under eight group would like um a liquid critic display and speech recognition
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0133108_0133838	we can probably do that ourselves and just sort of b. d. b. d.
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0019605_0019753	see if it works this way
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0124679_0124956	a very low consumption of rubbish compared to plastic
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0157714_0157817	desert problem
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0067308_0067648	well let me know when when it's sort of useful
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0179020_0179123	yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0101923_0102499	and because that you mentioned it would make the document station offline
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0191635_0191834	forty one about of forty nine
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0089313_0089572	yeah accurately the buttons in between
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0153532_0153701	so to keep it simple
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0034785_0035432	so a lot of interpreting feature there's probably a lot of interpretation features and from our people in paris and malan
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0011664_0011891	to with that already but we'll just go over it
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0200379_0200552	like curved curved
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0117392_0117667	i would greatly appeal not to do it
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0058494_0058654	well
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0060245_0060521	the cup cup yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0128626_0128741	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0202490_0202650	because um
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0221144_0221348	see you can
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0092196_0092783	does it talk to you now
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0168075_0168721	yeah we could yeah we could do that but i'm not sure if that would be very good for the easy of use
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0128615_0128800	or is it just what's behind it
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0014843_0015002	um three oh was yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0082453_0083439	analyze that older people spend their money easier more easily maybe it's feasible to just put the price of the remote up a little
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0202640_0203026	can you look into the company logo
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0009745_0009928	yeah
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0029867_0030117	and teletext got a uh six and a half a half
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0077443_0077562	okay
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0196111_0197066	um having maybe larger buttons or buttons that light up or buttons that are slightly differently shaped for people um
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0178402_0178668	yes yes we've done a lot
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0188300_0188413	oh just the amount in
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0118367_0118669	yeah it's spending all the money that i've lost yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0013106_0013608	then we will do the project uh evaluation and the closing after that
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0209408_0209642	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0169308_0169412	that's a compound now
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0084951_0085271	but then maybe that's looking at someone who's just sitting on their own
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0244908_0245011	oh for next week yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0095446_0096325	we have to remind to include that in our evaluation how did the gif produce your browsing experience
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0227452_0227764	and then i guess we'll stay in thirteen minutes again
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0170774_0171163	you could make it more comprehensible and make it for for the one
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0155209_0155380	so twenty four so we sh
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0086606_0086931	we could the only thing i could think of was an um
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0141234_0141583	it will be necessary to have a good help function as well
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0154275_0155070	however uh the decision we have to take in this meeting is who is our target group
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0059955_0060170	uh it's just one bad bet
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0216266_0216811	um but um i'm not sure about how to how to put all the information in there
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0168915_0169188	um did you feel like a team
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0173753_0173939	that is not exclusive
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0212398_0213152	i think we've done very well to get within budget and it's still make such an innovative idea that it i think people are really gonna want
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0274023_0274217	it doesn't have to be all innovative
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0041434_0041734	so then does this how is this how is how is this book published
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0029177_0030124	the um industrial designer is going to work on the working design uh components design and a bit of the look and feel design
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0171714_0172027	it's not like people trying to cut each other
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0030700_0030927	then there are some one time use function
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0026456_0026737	uh where should we come back as
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0216382_0216871	um l. c. d. display on the the top side of the flip top
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0006997_0007904	from every one to see how she bad market uh this this product uh at within the budget uh that was given
AMI_TS3003a_H01_MTD011UID_0147421_0147542	okay
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0053378_0053790	i thought it was u. v. like
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0184036_0184327	but for a remote he will just refer to the manual and all that
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0163548_0163860	so perhaps we should stick to the basic layout out
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0127378_0127795	well they did say wasn't the most efficient
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0208436_0208731	you really want multiple windows from a single laptop
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0042029_0042437	i haven't done it i haven't updated all those object files yet like 'cause it takes hours on these computers
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0020295_0020877	so and then they rite objects and the objects contain all the information about the meetings and the speaker
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0048363_0048767	then we have included one to nine buttons
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0111597_0111799	so so let's say
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0148522_0148694	yeah
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0074229_0074411	yeah uh i i think
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0010851_0011071	and as you already know i'm boring
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0037439_0038026	but um you know i know i would make them a bit nicer if i had more time about the moment it doesn't look like that
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0033420_0033651	yeah on the front on the front side of that yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0141567_0141760	i don't think
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0193727_0194086	alphabet we'll look for the new language and get the highest rated ones
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0080875_0081185	have to i'll have to move that wasn't it
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0037943_0038068	design
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0109501_0109808	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0125696_0125814	exactly yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0148244_0148497	one okay and b b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0086484_0086645	when we're through to the fee yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0091738_0092049	alright okay
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0016966_0017340	um getting a better feel for all these nite objects
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0090063_0090305	you can do that
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0124458_0124617	yeah yeah
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0057762_0057892	oh i'm thinking about a sort of
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0111239_0111597	because we don't wanna a search um locally we wanna search sort of globally
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0141775_0142195	and then it's kinda like there's usually things built in to
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0001346_0001673	uh morning
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0012988_0013135	that
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0184323_0184706	so audio signal should be possible as well
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0190479_0190598	oh yeah we have time
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0271599_0271853	oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0064279_0064838	mm no design the green first then 'cause if it w the problem is if you changed the classes
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0013476_0013865	i'm busy i'm in project management so i'll direct you through the project
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0129140_0129293	oh it would be flat in sight
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0020877_0021528	so the mi th who the speech is that at the meetings and the amount they speak and then the average they confine with the speakers
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0110175_0110677	then a helium bluebottle
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0014097_0014616	um i don't think we have any great discussion at this point
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0101208_0102046	so it's in my idea it's uh it's gonna be smart to innovate and not in uh in the product itself
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0073581_0073734	so that is eight
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0083182_0084080	if if make it usable for more than one device it's uh it's hard but i think it's possible but it's uh yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0195571_0195821	and if we can yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0068274_0068805	um i think i was wondering about that is uh i haven't looked at it so much
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0145959_0146145	black and other colours as well
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0017338_0017486	that's what i wanted to do about that
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0034404_0034674	and it the th the star up screen it's quite good it's quite good
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0014626_0014856	so you should probably look at the
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0125543_0125696	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0118703_0118805	yeah exactly
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0061802_0062025	that's what i feel as well
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0155687_0155789	two okay
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0174381_0174703	it's other than what
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0226386_0226994	now uh you know to to search for a u you know to help you match up with that one
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0196807_0196960	i just think it's better to do afterward
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0075352_0075888	and less can you i don't suppose you can minimize them and stuff like that can i can do that
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0026955_0027532	you'll just change i'm here or something two similar affect
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0110038_0110335	rubbish
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0044413_0044878	um and the button button part uh will be explained by f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0123998_0124113	exactly please
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0123125_0123299	and just um
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0032702_0032943	one hundred and sixty eight times per hour
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0091816_0091988	what kind of things do we have to consider there
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0144569_0145137	uh got up to that completely and just devaluated back to n light stuff 'cause it was much much easier
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0039939_0040252	uh yeah and uh we don't need uh a let or uh
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0184062_0184390	yeah
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0071171_0071568	uh uh working design yeah it's it's uh mainly technical design
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0209491_0209673	yeah all the little toys yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0125566_0125997	just what you said uh i i didn't get the uh the meaning of it completely
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0107867_0108482	um the problem with the kayaking is that uh that's
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0017503_0017732	no that's fine that's fine
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0035556_0035682	yeah we were good
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0136433_0136556	okay that's cool
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0186440_0186706	uh i you know when ever
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0235508_0235796	it's the ninth right code and then you got ninth right elements in this
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0138503_0139147	we can convert the two circuits for different types of buttons like we are keeping the standard buttons on the top and the more complex buttons on the bottom and the more complex buttons in the thing
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0047900_0048145	maybe their speaker configuration may get slim
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0084859_0085347	it's uh doesn't uh apply any technical restrictions
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0082870_0083007	okay
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0049996_0050809	that's meant to be an eagle you can tell it's a flying animal could be a sea creature
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0009601_0009826	yeah yeah i was getting the impression as well
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0155364_0155633	yeah
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0028810_0029082	and remember you have to press so it works
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0035170_0035689	now the function of a remote is to send messages to the television
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0031293_0032097	uh the decision that we took last time was that uh the special feature we would like to see is a speech recognition
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0190431_0190658	i mean three three three or after what
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0106358_0106545	you you have to use actions
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0035738_0036107	so a good thing to have to say we could what we could have done if we had more time
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0057459_0058127	it's uh possible to uh to make a um quick uh system uh recognition
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0024362_0024997	it did actually say on the email that they were sort of coming in and they were sort of coming in and they were fairly easy to get hold of
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0064653_0064783	but it'd be good to have it there
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0197880_0198070	uh you can have a sort of preferences
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0131891_0132149	like just like yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0151710_0152186	if we were if we were working to have a specification as this is what this project is working for
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0046539_0046695	they shouldn't break down easily
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0036119_0036880	no the main components i came up with um were obviously the power sources for the batteries 'cause otherwise it's not gonna work
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0098059_0098324	when you press the button you can actually see your pressed button
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0073552_0074028	you g yeah but are you do you wanna a change that m the original enbriefa file then
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0005751_0006002	everybody found its place again
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0102290_0102604	uh i think yeah i think yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0192552_0192970	yeah some sort of documenting station or
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0158226_0158339	five more minutes
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0109781_0110213	but i mean general t. v. controls do video as well
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0026982_0027116	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0054498_0054741	due to sixteen
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0030752_0031064	that's a fat cat
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0146796_0147715	it's gonna be the same so we need to focus on just one thing not get bogged down in lots of different um possibilities
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0166261_0166473	part of it's gonna be probably
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0141065_0141279	it could be in decline
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0054476_0054921	has to be so great that they're gonna say oh twenty five euros isn't much
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0102731_0103149	just yeah the c re using code and stuff and just like okay good
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0102692_0102808	yes
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0057962_0058204	sort yeah it's a it's a bit of a savoury thing
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0121635_0121783	yeah that's true yeah
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0149725_0150587	if we uh make a a button for example for big substitutes which is essentially on the remote control
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0189594_0190013	like if they if they know exactly where they wanna go they wanna go to you know that meeting on different
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0128388_0128951	so if if we want to view a particular programme at say nine o'clock he can set the time
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0214615_0215164	just all here and here is just go to where ever and a go button
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0137109_0137442	we'll just go for push buttons for in the interest of cost
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0127940_0128171	okay
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0106024_0106677	so um there are ways around it but you know whether i'll be able to fix something out like that before tomorrow yeah i know
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0271446_0271683	either disregard it or wipe away again
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0168814_0168924	okay
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0105433_0105566	okay thank you
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0111508_0111638	put it into a window at least
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0032772_0033027	yeah yeah which just copy it out
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0018003_0018170	that's a good point
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0186123_0186346	um what other functions
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0149676_0149785	on side
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0157798_0158314	yeah and i think today there are not many people who don't have a t. v.
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0232570_0232677	is that everyone's happy
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0026083_0026667	it's all right but
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0167535_0167757	so so what's that two weeks maybe
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0146883_0147426	so the general score would that be um for the whole a for all for the whole of the call
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0145965_0146120	yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0111164_0111424	so that uh i think financing was pretty simple USER:so that uh i think financing was pretty simple
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0115201_0115311	okay that's not
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0080981_0081579	yeah uh well i think that everybody is gonna say their remote control is practical
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0137000_0137171	richard arguments was very good
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0195004_0195515	on the bottom we're gonna have the rubber the rubber ones the an. t. r. s. i. o. r. s. i. o. r. s. i. o. r. s. i. o. r. s. i. o. r. s. i. o. r. s. i. o. r. s. i. o. r. s. i. o. r. s. i. o. r. s. i. o. r. s. i. o. r. s. i. o. r. s. i. o. r. s. i. o. r. s. i. o. r. s. i. o. r. s. i. o. r. s. i. o. r. s. i. o. r. s. i. o. r. s. i. o. r. s
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0150440_0150541	should i do that then
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0223369_0224053	you could do markus sorta style and hold it over and hold it up a thing
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0165076_0165328	but i think they won't be very much buttons
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0084751_0085069	um it's uh it's uh a not a in a colour or something
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0091106_0091392	if there are more buttons then it will be more complicated
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0062032_0062575	at that moment it's it's like it's like um what you call it the lights a sensors you know
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0161756_0162029	it will recognize my voice and will switch on
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0158787_0158889	well or because it
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0026783_0026961	what's easier to display on the screen
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0062365_0063158	i should at yeah at least very least have um a goo goo and uh where it'll be warning that in help me now
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0163776_0164224	cause that that was just a bubble on excel you could just take that out
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0070898_0071135	on your home irregularity not in there okay
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0015303_0016034	that has infrared bits and it has an interface controls w interface it controls the chip
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0101936_0102270	and then there is a some if statement saying s strip on the you know
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0201327_0201462	was the room for creativity
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0049850_0049965	okay i see
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0002271_0002425	uh good enough
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0041920_0042435	we we you know uh yeah we managed that nicely and no
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0040278_0040500	and t have a different menu for uh
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0051055_0051227	alright
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0045327_0045670	uh i think the most frequently used buttons should be emphasized
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0206234_0206344	in any every convenience
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0021224_0021610	we discussed some more on cats questioners
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0083604_0084156	i have one one w one little question that i reckon we should have a little ikon for our brass
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0201997_0202359	the very you hold of it's kind of semisecular in the bottom something like that
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0168333_0168547	sort of good
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0189165_0189312	do you want like a back up
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0095286_0095859	that all we need the one case uncurved flat single curved double curved
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0076024_0076748	yeah i mean just keep it simple
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0062821_0062982	uh okay well um
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0075518_0075806	so simplicity of symbols you could think of
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0134649_0134767	yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0225035_0225419	evenually it will have a logo on it just like everything but everything else has a logo on it
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0214271_0214736	um the project has been evaluated well and truly
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0102459_0103250	the the main problems with the well you could go for a wood but i think it would be a bit in practical
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0098356_0098896	you know there's small movements of the remote control can leave to kind of sholder and elbow problems
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0184862_0185309	oh thing is yeah if yeah if you know something like that could happen any time 'cause uh yeah
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0097647_0097780	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0171189_0171295	yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0165402_0165877	it's not channel it's not when it finishes it's not anything like that it's just number
AMI_TS3003a_H02_MTD0010ID_0143042_0143150	no
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0215917_0216096	mm-hmm
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0036132_0036419	yeah we have to first define what what happens when you click on a user
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0052198_0052354	because i think it might do something
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0094226_0094356	is that what we're using
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0123433_0123820	if you press the volume button you can control the volume with the scroll wheel
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0066770_0067159	oh yeah well but then those people we can't help everybody
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0052829_0053345	maybe different colours or materials or materials you know
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0083778_0083904	um
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0132456_0132604	so let's try it
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0072255_0072883	well i have one question uh will there be anything rich on the buttons
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0148901_0149184	well i wouldn't design a telephone but
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0163566_0163798	do that as well it'll be really nice yeah
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0026467_0026733	um a different remote we're not very functional
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0125292_0125439	in not innovative
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0161177_0161402	yeah yeah yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0181831_0182425	you know that it sets in then pressing the button then having so we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0118064_0118366	yeah one of them and one sample sensing in sample speaker
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0119607_0119842	it's not exactly wires we are using
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0007473_0008027	so after that you'll be uh free to go and spend all your money
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0264093_0264561	if if if they are looking for like i say sorry day and
AMI_IS1009a_H01_FIO087_0080408_0080526	okay okay
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0064779_0065694	no this is a big overhead which can not be misplaced or it's probably to be misplaced
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0110964_0111441	so you have a button button on your document station which you can push and then it starts beeping
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0119796_0120427	more d it was wasn't mute but it was i had to sit there and think about it for a bit was a bit reluctant
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0075365_0076057	i mean calculates is you don't really throw around a lot of what's remotes you do they can't t
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0218169_0218366	do we need another meeting this week
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0020970_0021307	it's an e x c do e x c do e x c do e x c do e x c do e x c do e x c do e x c do e x c do e x c do e x c do e x c do e x c do e x c do e x c do e x c do e x c do e x c do e x c do e x c do e x c do e x c do e x c do e x c do e x c do e x c do e x c do e x c do e x c do e x c do e x c do e x c do e x c do e x c do e x c do e x c do e x c do e x c do e x c do e x c do e x c do e x c do e x c do e x c do e x c do e x c do e x c do e x c do e x c do
