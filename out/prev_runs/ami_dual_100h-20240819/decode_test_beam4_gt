AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0017055_0017265	if too many buttons are pressed
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0164381_0164747	because if you have a discursive thing here and then another discursive thing there
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0137932_0138302	yeah just search for a specific string
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0128564_0128777	yeah i've i've got one at home
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0171408_0171523	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0210615_0211023	or he doesn't and then he searches for one that sort of looks like
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0260376_0260692	um we d did we decide whether it should be ranked
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0113936_0114207	it's called a nite text pane or something isn't it
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0001955_0002125	is everybody sitting on the right place
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0132233_0133122	it's just another um i mean these meetings are not endlessly long it's just words and to print all of them out selectively
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0119781_0120514	okay now the things that i was thinking and th my wish list has really been realised in this prototype
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0115233_0115933	our production cost um can be maximal twelve and a half euros
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0235657_0235767	fifty grand
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0106383_0106722	okay i've got finance here now
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0045889_0046271	so the double click will do that and so save them the trouble of right clicking and choosing the item on the menu
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0046515_0046621	small right
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0220232_0220665	or was is this nothing to do with the project requirements is this just that was an add on feature
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0141020_0141277	okay
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0050347_0050518	sort of well i don't know
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0045291_0045449	like i'm just thinking to have the default there
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0006711_0006820	okay right see ya
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0023891_0024199	yeah supposedly all calculated yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0088855_0089231	so maybe because there's more space it's not kind of moving around trying to
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0085982_0086172	to d the shape is uh
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0117565_0117771	this week's only two days old
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0181283_0181419	and fake r. c. s
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0216811_0217577	because we need drop down menu but we want all the information about the name the longer name and the sp and the users
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0087944_0088144	they're brilliant animal animals
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0008138_0008820	uh in general the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0129552_0130090	and then functionality um i think you did a really good job on functionality
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0212327_0212444	yeah it was
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0043307_0044180	we've just got the the power going to the infrared bulb with the chip and the uh u. i. interface um
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0068232_0068607	do you mean just the yeah but it's not gonna take very long
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0190674_0191003	um something like that should reduce the size of it
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0015168_0015754	this thing we are gonna um uh design is a new remote control
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0058705_0058934	all's a lot all's like twenty five
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0174621_0174748	a blank one
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0156462_0156642	and evaluation of the
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0192791_0192913	you do need to have a key for it
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0068974_0069596	uh everybody everybody knows it so uh uh you don't have to change that
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0089817_0090047	i think we should disc discuss that
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0099946_0100175	it's hard to tell whether it was a a transcript or whatever
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0117268_0117552	and show the the prototype to consumer research groups
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0110866_0111006	mm-hmm yes
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0182347_0182533	mm no that's difficult
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0143082_0143247	okay
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0112478_0112878	and that comes with a whole load of highlighting extras as well
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0233998_0234346	yeah
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0116878_0117215	let's have a discussion on the control functions
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0199631_0199794	you just like or
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0098888_0099364	thinking sometimes in a case like that like a run across um in other languages
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0018302_0018699	so otherwise you just have a right click or do you have have a
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0060321_0060809	so it'd still be yeah we had to buy one
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0023970_0024180	she's only gonna tell us we got it wrong anyway
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0088279_0088765	yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0172417_0172825	or we have to make a left uh for lefties and
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0127211_0128210	'cause we're gonna get an email on our uh m. s. c. list saying from steve we need volunt yeah
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0177578_0177728	yeah of course that we can do
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0255215_0255501	oh you're just sending it to no
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0042533_0042730	people with less means
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0119772_0119940	oh that's complete rubbish anyway
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0004703_0004842	welcome
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0227763_0228698	um that seems to make sense but if it turns out that it's hugely expensive we'd have to cut down somewhere else then it's worth thinking about
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0147540_0148015	they n n yeah but you p minus three plus two
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0103842_0104599	and it just doesn't let you save certain things and it's just kinda um trying to to do a different kind of to go to a different window
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0095602_0095807	yes no that's important
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0167730_0167888	um yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0213692_0214036	maybe they are gonna steal our ideas and sell it
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0006588_0006734	okay
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0034045_0034226	in the room
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0016636_0017055	there should be extra features like lid buttons maybe a beep
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0169762_0169980	you can make a banana shaped one
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0233005_0233184	docking station
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0042160_0042326	so they jump out
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0069493_0069749	let's take 'em to the next joke
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0032877_0033282	am i supposed to wipe off that or okay
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0215704_0216048	and the other topic says welcome to welcome to our browser
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0087539_0087996	okay we had looks and voice recognition
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0106053_0106854	uh i'm i was a bit worried about when well when he talked about this with the mm file messing around with files
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0023119_0023309	but well we we can have both but whatever
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0066729_0067250	so this is a jumbo universal remote control and it's impossible to im misplace or lose
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0106555_0106792	well we can put the logic in a yeah
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0020965_0021091	but you already knew that
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0151464_0151692	oh yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0084719_0085603	i mean just to try it and i mean for us to to be able to do something that we can include with your thing so so eas yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0133154_0133380	it uh it's a bit uh
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0182581_0182878	hundreds of p. d. f. s
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0162741_0162952	uh is it functional
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0045439_0045574	speaker characterisation
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0081365_0081509	what about granny and grandads
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0181663_0182241	so then i can just sorta trace back and figure out what objects they are and bring 'em into here
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0213084_0213742	and finally the body should be retouchable may maybe ch you can change the body or the case casing the case outside
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0130408_0130522	and you have more pictures
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0193828_0194709	i suggest um the single curved because maybe the curve is pretty good to put the the screen in
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0028614_0028945	i had a play with it um yesterday
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0094088_0094233	but that's a hassle too
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0106575_0107074	i still can't make it run t. n. t. from java
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0146055_0146174	yeah you might be right
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0099959_0100154	it doesn't take too long no
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0190501_0191179	but we we were told we could end the final meeting at any time whenever we felt we were finished
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0068459_0068569	the text box
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0184719_0184848	are the costs within budget
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0114688_0114846	yeah right away
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0154766_0155184	uh yes i would like to include this feature which is called as voice recogniser
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0022781_0022916	yeah that's right
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0140886_0141138	he uh he should not be harmed in any way
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0034196_0034711	how the remote looks like so that it is sellable it is attractive to customers
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0174008_0174408	and that generally will be a bit crude but it will give you a d score
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0050845_0051764	the design should minimise r. s. i. and be easy to locate and we were still um uh slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there
AMI_TS3003a_H01_MTD011UID_0120696_0120802	five minutes okay
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0092912_0093190	spent too much time in front of it i think
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0047777_0048030	that'll be the easiest way to do yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0094354_0094603	if you if you see how thin the tracks are
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0048126_0048468	oh dear it doesn't look what like what i want it to be
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0250776_0250894	or if we could try one
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0164816_0165230	bright colourful trendy trendy design and strong
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0030288_0030916	um it should have a fruit and vegetable design and should have a soft feel
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0210623_0210881	but i think but you were saying that that's quite
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0194339_0195069	because as soon as they've got loaded their first meeting y they can they can browse through that quite nicely
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0179398_0179899	and uh i think we are we happy with the means we used
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0096156_0096516	yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0125507_0125757	so if you don't wanna use it you just don't use it
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0036524_0036731	they are not really very interested in features
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0088539_0088654	that's nice
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0070776_0071251	yeah or even just have buttons on it toggle buttons or something on the tool bar for that window
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0106846_0106986	oh ju just bec mm
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0115913_0116369	asked if w they would if people would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0029782_0030242	um i don't really know how to involve the speaker characterisation into the browsing
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0098719_0099113	you don't wanna swing before you can watch television
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0108805_0109267	it's a java course
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0042120_0042597	yeah and uh i'll have to think on the spot of uh things that it is
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0238898_0239158	i know it is
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0032507_0032731	i mean it's like a nice thing
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0017486_0018262	um this speaker um the data processing is fine but uh we don't particularly want to do the b the the b the gui for it
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0205664_0206292	was it clear what everybody had to do uh according to their roles and functions
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0219181_0219500	i think i've got minutes for two of the meeting and the
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0170443_0170561	mm
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0145405_0145518	okay
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0159599_0160018	have you got people yet for us or what are you thinking and when
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0199280_0199424	yeah
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0171259_0171654	uh our next meeting will be in thirty minutes
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0075002_0075156	practical wise okay
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0081521_0081896	you mean to save it lesser number
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0215998_0216302	it's easier to uh share it with uh other people
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0089624_0089850	i think it's uh difficult as well but
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0175288_0175809	you will receive specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0192189_0192592	so there's not a really a decision to be made there um
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0066537_0066801	well i'll do this i'll do that you know it just all falls together
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0080297_0080874	just wanna find out what kind of objects those were that um for the other ones
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0234815_0235146	just but it's i think in that case it's the wr write corpus
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0177991_0178153	because i think that's uh
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0114834_0115187	it was a regular chip on print and
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0200613_0201118	and new f television products coming up but nobody giving uh much idea to this
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0191761_0191972	yeah
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0142809_0142949	okay
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0022276_0022645	three different types of design that we're gonna be concerned with okay
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0127782_0128591	what is um attractive to a trendy new yorker and what is attractive to a retired south african i dunno you get the idea
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0093820_0094017	but how does scroll wheel work here
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0073824_0074169	that it that it that the price is a good price
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0058085_0058757	yeah yeah something like that so that yeah about seventeen seventeen pounds something like that
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0130210_0130370	yeah that's true
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0233769_0233929	and uh a thing
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0023745_0024214	let's just cut out the middle man you know
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0092561_0092947	and finally last but not least easy to locate
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0062662_0062874	'cause they use them quite frequently in watches
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0041033_0041181	and then this lot is on th
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0148167_0148477	i think that's a good idea as well especially for the subtitles
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0030899_0031139	di just some way to sort of leverage that information
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0050630_0050771	i think we have to keep that
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0056905_0057415	should we i don't know do you think mike about our things that we had together
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0143963_0144215	although on the fly it's typic it's it's typically pretty fun
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0051054_0051832	and in order to make it really sellable we've gotta shorten the learning curve make sure it's really intuitive and easy to use
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0081248_0081582	actually just to clarify last week when we were talking about our search results
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0201135_0201925	if we want um a with uh for example the the telephone for elderly people we can
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0019599_0019852	and how it would works you press the button
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0233929_0234196	um and i'll be able to not answer them
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0026563_0027101	and i'll be coming to you to tell me what's gonna make somebody take out their wallet you know
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0182770_0183332	like just just say okay well here's you know everything's basic in set up and then just yeah just jump right in
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0035911_0036174	alright okay
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0032413_0032773	it's your best friend and your you can talk to a dog it can be your best friend
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0020047_0020887	and as i said on the slide there consulting the industrial engineer about that and the other thing is timing is really gonna be as important as money
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0059834_0060386	i mean the amount the amount of probably moving around you'd be doing all the time would would charge it up
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0144422_0144689	what i feel is customers never said anything about the battery
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0105794_0105945	hmm
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0144689_0144939	it's internal nobody looks into the battery
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0025597_0026145	uh for uh yeah shif shifting up in uh on t on t uh teletext and shifting uh down
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0212007_0212165	ooh
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0189656_0189882	do we do we have some time left
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0035790_0036251	n uh these functions we don't have anything to do with only undo you can undo a little
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0071927_0072435	and then you can either do it automatically or you can just hard code and say look get me the time stamps
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0078888_0079032	that would really work
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0091895_0092155	because then we save ten buttons
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0088191_0088855	maybe because it's slightl with the size that we've got it's quite small but with the amount of stuff we're putting on it isn't that much
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0087143_0087685	a kind of uh touchscreen um and it's uh for
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0146533_0146683	yeah
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0007276_0007726	uh now we're going um into the functional design
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0145782_0146250	ours has to be look really great and it has to come out before the others
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0019391_0019703	you could change your project
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0149964_0150225	any other hints they could give us
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0050682_0050792	well i don't know what that means
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0225935_0226310	what preference so it may come round to market research at some point to see what people would like
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0142837_0143107	uh it's been a f couple of years since i've looked into anything like this
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0165863_0166384	repetition of certain but buttons which i already explained example the volume and channel control buttons
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0046605_0046933	well it might come to us as we start playing with it
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0049787_0050177	you can use this pen by holding it like a like a little child
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0235728_0236002	fifteen fifteen million
AMI_TS3003a_H02_MTD0010ID_0058364_0058516	mm-hmm
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0076625_0076783	so okay
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0021791_0021898	there we go
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0194469_0194768	docking station l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0213571_0214400	so the f only thing that comes up when you're finished is a um when you start it's just one window like that and it's got all the search stuff like down there
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0184614_0184842	rather than having to email it yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0076864_0077108	polish supplier
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0161282_0162274	i just said i said what i've done so far and what i'm gonna do and some pro some issues
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0012264_0012897	so we have to see if it fits within the twelve and a half euro per remote
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0083585_0084194	yeah well yeah well that has been e that has been eliminated so that's that's unfortunately a moot point now
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0154016_0154252	we're planning on having a big party on the twenty fourth
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0133009_0133455	and then we get to the point of the case
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0093019_0093692	these are all this uh technical uh electri electronic compons uh components which are which we have to use in a remote controller
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0158314_0158496	there are a few but in general not
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0149964_0150187	yeah term frequency inverse document frequency
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0008872_0009062	okay
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0034874_0035285	um they like to use new f new functions
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0111480_0111676	so i am not sure what it's called now
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0214736_0215214	um and we've got the meeting survey and questionnaire
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0168763_0169041	and if you have less buttons you can do a lot more with
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0173296_0173446	how did you find it
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0242163_0242325	even if it were their covers
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0085470_0085653	yeah that's what we need yeah
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0047965_0048737	okay so my personal preferences in this um project are really have to concentrate on the sizzle
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0099902_0100259	i guess that's why we have a separate speech lab
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0075916_0076308	you do get a bit of wear but don't calculators have a battery in them as well
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0211382_0211679	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0109343_0109760	i think it was just like as long as we implement one of these interfaces for this particular type of window
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0152773_0153143	maybe that was us then not him
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0019412_0019547	and the company logo
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0116827_0117229	so if that would increase the price for which we're selling our remote control
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0009911_0010221	uh so i suggest let's get started
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0130060_0130210	yeah that's true
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0192679_0193086	like if they're looking for particular person particular working group particular whatever
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0124736_0125544	to get the data i for example to get the summarisation data you have to search for i think the i. d. s or something
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0164659_0164887	that would be so useful
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0087126_0087445	there it is
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0113995_0114217	um it might have influenced our choice
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0085854_0085988	yeah so we can plug it in and
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0099496_0099666	yeah just a blank sheet
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0209080_0209463	this would definitely be different enough i just wondered if anybody could come up with something even more
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0207042_0207490	because uh maybe your hand is in the way if you have the display here
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0191133_0191290	oh you haven't got a key do you
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0083172_0083306	okay
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0020670_0021549	it would be sort of inset into the into the top and the buttons at the bottom would d so so it'll fully close flat
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0206842_0207000	so 'kay
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0025267_0025508	oh
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0059159_0059383	have you taken any more of a look at it
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0172871_0173724	and uh the u. i. d. is supposed to uh come up with the user interface design
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0125432_0125558	uh what what
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0083208_0083491	that otherwise it's just sort of hard plastic
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0197610_0198058	based on what they did the last time
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0219563_0219865	okay you're just looking for one specific speaker right
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0203687_0203961	and i think it's wonderful our company's so r. and d. based
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0150789_0151461	if they see this design they think oh there are only five buttons and uh but we will see
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0194615_0194841	well i think we can only aff yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0033769_0034754	yeah the the well you can you can get the sort of circular round ones but i'm just wondering about power consumption and how much you need to send the data across
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0265179_0265811	it just doesn't you're looking for that term and relevance is kind of irrelevant because if the term shows up it shows up
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0213744_0213984	maybe someone'll r run down and patent it
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0017291_0017511	so we've got forty minutes for all of it
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0104111_0104351	yeah it's pretty skinny cat
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0017284_0018010	she would like to see a timer and or alarm facility integrated
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0027329_0027798	i mean so that things are all modular i mean it would be a good idea if we used that same idea for anything else we do
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0028819_0029177	but i think you know it already by yourself
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0136194_0136389	yeah yeah
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0083464_0083927	so that's a problem regardless of of any design modifications you you come up with
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0117552_0118356	we don't s want somebody to suddenly come to us and tell us that this button is toxic and you know some child will swallow it and then we won't sell any
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0042884_0043116	it runs it much faster than if i do it here
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0106240_0106856	our control is only going to be for t. v. it's not going to be a combined control
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0137707_0137976	we have to cut costs
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0155506_0155799	'cause we've done all the background work to go for that if they want it
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0000020_0000483	help
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0115991_0116432	nite object model i think that's what
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0120470_0120896	but it's it could be time consuming like if there are ten documents that hit with this thing then
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0163365_0163504	right
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0056045_0056157	do you mean the single channel
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0111299_0112231	and it uh it's was apparently generated by going to d generate javadoc and it just went spat it all out and they never bothered to uh d comment anything
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0113394_0114347	um yeah i guess i mean it was a good point you had that like collaborating with the file things
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0006547_0006729	so maybe we start with you
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0163055_0163217	okay
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0071212_0071434	when it's finished up global otherwise it would get confusing
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0012134_0012611	yes y opening acquaintance tool training well
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0243115_0243612	i mean uh i think i'm gonna do quite a bit of work this week so i'll have probably more to talk about
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0099449_0099697	i could tell you what i done in s. p. two
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0091705_0091985	i think by default they are i think really
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0072104_0072410	okay and now i'm supposed to yeah
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0116197_0116303	mm-hmm
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0120774_0121027	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0091142_0091801	but if you don't then it won't l yeah it says okay oh yeah i've got all this space you can use some
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0000358_0000538	yeah exactly yeah yeah yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0148554_0148713	that's right
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0164731_0165115	yeah it'll get behind schedule yeah pretty quick
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0134440_0134932	and single curved you have to have a different uh different machine than a flat one
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0052876_0053288	some people have and acknowledgement is a big one that comes up all the time yes no questions
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0023928_0024337	well in uh i guess in in in meeting browser one point one
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0047249_0047547	now the collection of the criteria as we saw in our previous meeting
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0124688_0124836	next one
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0154007_0154164	deadline for submission of final report
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0144286_0144428	wh why you need that up
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0088899_0089550	which basically has these contacts that are really close together and then when you press down on the rubber button
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0256480_0256648	but right well that's what i thought when you said that
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0123724_0123835	yeah like
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0097550_0097667	a rabbit
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0095217_0095416	um scroll
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0016519_0016699	so maybe you wanna make some notes of that
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0033357_0033549	i don't know we'll get to that later
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0208684_0209080	we looked at those remotes i mean they are kind of anonymous very similar looking things
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0282576_0282773	yeah
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0188355_0188928	it might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it which would explain a button if you press it
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0084553_0084817	you you wouldn't lose it so much
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0090047_0090706	um for the case uh the supplement and the buttons it really depends on the designer
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0078855_0079091	ooh it's vibrating that's strange
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0116826_0117456	so i'm just thinking if it's kinda like you were saying you have to have a nom object right
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0173310_0173625	okay
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0126120_0126533	but that will mean that you can only do things on actually no uh 'cause you need to do things on word level
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0004479_0004718	um how uh how we doing
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0011216_0012023	we decided it was important to reflect the company's image in our product we put fashion in electronics you know that kind of s thing
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0141247_0141500	i thought it said twen i thought he said twenty fifth
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0110905_0111510	if yeah and if you got if you got a sky box they have one of those plus boxes
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0121865_0122367	use to find it needs to be something that you don't lose you were saying whistling
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0035432_0035654	be interesting to see what our design people make of that
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0177235_0177373	it was
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0124381_0124649	well it's those laptops
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0019509_0019685	so but that'd be yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0095977_0096116	well
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0135352_0135967	no no no th the the the scrolling wheels are different like you can go for a sw switches like buttons or scrolls
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0055337_0055442	then please next slide
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0082502_0083092	or do we want them all in one pane with like an icon or a different colour or something to indicate what type of result they are
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0101685_0101792	yeah yeah
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0091369_0091737	or what about kind of a dual function
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0133645_0133757	that's good to remember
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0019703_0020121	do a p. h. d. or uh yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0158991_0159180	and you can just yeah then click it in
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0095856_0096061	until you've got the right number then you push it
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0116540_0116682	okay
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0159488_0159909	sort of but then the main idea was more like to to speed it up speed the search up
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0161402_0161533	that would just be a nice extra
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0075146_0075269	okay yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0216954_0217203	i think the celebration is the twenty five pounds
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0223739_0224192	was there anything else there that we in the new new project requirements
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0025379_0025658	yeah well i mean it's up to you if you wanna keep going with that
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0147775_0147937	yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0164949_0165076	and the lower distance
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0232000_0232366	some sort of field which updates dynamically depending on what you've got highlighted
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0038453_0038660	just n normal plain buttons
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0004152_0004342	good at this
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0213100_0213867	so you could have like psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones and
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0091621_0091739	okay
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0130623_0130801	you get a a much smaller remote
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0256144_0256292	summary of the project
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0176696_0176832	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0143725_0143963	i don't know do well we don't wanna have to do that right
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0192972_0193082	it's got a lock door button
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0089579_0090048	and uh it should be with uh um equipped with timer and alarm facility
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0072755_0073010	losing one decimal place that's okay
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0225026_0225240	then we can save this one in the
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0051484_0051863	t throw stuff throwing out the window
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0177666_0177789	right true
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0126238_0126970	uh if we put a lot of effort in those we can make a remote control with uh just two or three buttons
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0164998_0165536	if our company is if it is easily recognisable that our company made it
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0198979_0199684	well you just you just uh you just scroll down the list and find your favourite one
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0287945_0288070	tick
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0184190_0184550	not for such simple functions because we're focusing on that yes okay
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0156418_0156912	if you if yeah if you have like buttons that appear on the screen in this l. c. d. screen
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0153591_0153741	this is on a i i
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0281067_0281627	yeah there are already seventy f but there are seventy five meeting
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0232098_0232225	are the costs within the budget
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0100916_0101130	sure b y yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0256421_0256688	are we supposed to go into our own rooms again
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0191260_0191791	w we well we can get in through the through the the card the card door
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0053683_0053812	although yeah yeah
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0050176_0050322	ah eagle right okay
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0001232_0001522	so what do we need to talk about
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0082937_0083405	yeah my grandad's actually better than me at using teletext so
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0269767_0270631	or you could do it and override it by the you ca you could just ignore the d ranking if it doesn't show up together
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0056139_0056775	um i've been looking at uh the user interface of it
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0014375_0014502	all of you
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0164442_0165203	so have the um the volume and the programme things like that on the lower side
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0108360_0109058	but uh feels like it's it's a java course more than anything else
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0172320_0172808	can i just run this past you while it occurs to me i don't mean to quickly jump from one subject to another
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0046331_0046436	mm-hmm mm-hmm
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0118948_0119275	so that's leads us to our little discussion
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0031087_0031550	that uh audio settings video settings and channel settings buttons
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0098073_0098582	so how do we feel about this
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0105088_0105449	that is the use of transist transistor we which we use in the remote controller
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0140877_0141040	that's a battery stays
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0042623_0042742	into the method
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0037935_0038266	but put it under changes since the initial specification
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0207456_0207592	yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0188570_0188695	the transcript or whatever it is
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0093287_0093764	right well i've been uh i've been doing some random pop up windows for the speaker characterisation which is good
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0044882_0045291	and just show up the the particular instances of that topic in a meeting
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0042869_0043119	yeah of course using remote control
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0040011_0040261	so okay
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0145444_0145718	but if you take away the voice recognition then you've got it
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0077822_0077961	exclusive
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0156213_0156360	i think if you if you only l
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0148526_0148668	exactly me too
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0052255_0052654	yeah uh that was good start
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0036739_0036844	yeah
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0068849_0069212	i think you all did you get uh notices on your computer for this
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0226030_0226150	okay
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0117863_0117973	alright
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0003189_0003551	that's possible on uh this time of day
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0047771_0047964	so there's not much to uh
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0208960_0209296	i think it was just the produc uh just the production cost of the phone
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0015184_0015707	we're gonna be touching on all that during the other part for the progress and putting screen shots and all the rest yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0005038_0005142	so yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0065308_0065495	i would say four
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0042611_0042816	actually yeah like um another common thing
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0045420_0046093	if we see i don't know if i've filled in correctly so just correct me if you see uh something wrong
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0183640_0183894	okay so that's okay that might be good
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0091683_0091941	no uh i i it no they're not world readable
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0121071_0121245	would you want it full full screen
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0040963_0041128	so yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0073933_0074457	will have symbols so that that that the user really knows you know and doesn't have to first learn it
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0103711_0104097	yeah but i think that's that is a big advantage if we're
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0060622_0061042	would you do the summarisation as you populate it
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0012023_0012947	um our budget would have to affect um try not to reflect our budget um that we might
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0090467_0090932	um but then you can't see all of them at the same time and it's just like
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0175287_0175410	think it's uh seven
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0065609_0066132	adding those up we've got a six and a five eleven divided by four is what
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0285850_0286022	well we'll discuss it again on friday
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0055123_0055827	that is true because they put a newspaper or they put it behind a plant or we you know whatever
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0107578_0107880	whenever the t. v. is on remote controller will have a light
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0157652_0158052	did we wanna meet before we talk to steve next week
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0117284_0117607	could you go back to that slide where she had that uh s slide up betsy
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0073665_0073815	there's always stuff in the way isn't there
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0081185_0081594	uh whoops
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0098982_0099792	you complete a specific connection that means when you when you press a button there will be a s a small circuit underneath the button
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0020378_0021157	that is it's gonna be individual work and then at the meeting we'll discuss what uh we have come up with
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0158747_0158964	are they really going to quibble about ten p.
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0023549_0023655	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0054797_0055107	you give it any number and it will give you the top whatever for each person
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0233013_0233294	we can do all of that without even ever going anywhere near loading up a
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0124992_0125139	it's not too slow though that thing
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0070404_0071261	a the the these these two are th to increase or decrease the volumes and these two are to uh scroll the programme channels
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0131716_0131893	so that's a pretty handy um
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0124267_0124755	he's not around this week is he or that's why i think that's why we didn't have the the meeting
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0073336_0073698	well yeah just the one thing that's like the action for loading up the search thing
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0219105_0219240	drop down is definitely not
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0052691_0052920	oh right okay i'm not good at golf
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0029410_0029595	but i'm never online on the morning
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0137498_0138269	we don't have a lot of time left and we will still have to make a decision and the marketing expert has to present her her thing
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0206073_0206264	yeah i didn't think you'd bother with that but yeah cool
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0162868_0163243	you us if we just use the shell as an example again you open that
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0149671_0149979	oh we have three
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0129104_0129298	yes but it's not the biggest part of the
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0051365_0051759	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0099650_0099878	yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0094603_0095211	you could you could s you could put them virtually right next to each other and have a much smaller switch on each one
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0031175_0031708	i'd like the suggestions to be really specific so that we'll have a list of things we can cross off
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0205778_0205904	it's madness
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0085733_0086046	um so it'll be on the search window bottom half of the search window
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0199088_0199348	it's true
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0148079_0148241	i keep seeing zero
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0168924_0169280	just something like uh edinburgh university
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0166372_0166561	product evaluation
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0120575_0120691	there's a blop of text
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0107820_0108083	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0170510_0170929	i think so with our l. c. d. screen docking station scroll buttons
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0076581_0077006	have transcript without the disfluency transcript with the disfluent disfluency
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0106163_0106420	but if you push the teletext button twice
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0167959_0168230	depends how you treat your compound nouns
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0177559_0178451	um yeah maybe you wanna do um left handed um yeah one left click um highlights the the result in whatever you've got open
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0007291_0007454	yeah mine doesn't stick today either
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0066273_0066537	i mean you write down the words and the ideas as oh okay
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0017650_0017791	okay yeah i'll go first
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0180861_0181069	no it's not very handy i think
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0023326_0023877	so put it in the top section rather than the bottom sections 'cause it's the top part that's okay
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0074373_0074971	good point because we need the symbols 'cause we're going into an international market we can't have anything that's language dependent
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0106975_0107255	maybe i'll try
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0137830_0138232	yes and as john reece said the buttons can be
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0095628_0096094	then also we can if it is a rechargeable one then uh people can use it for a long time
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0140434_0140639	it's not a lot though
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0103624_0103767	yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0162068_0162501	anybody else have any other comments or any other things that we feel we should evaluate
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0022728_0023525	and i've consulted some additional trend watch trend watchers after the original trend watchers return about what the
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0209312_0209994	so it looks well it looks like it's gonna be fifty percent profit you've still got all of the overheads to come out of that
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0067023_0067170	one guy has top five joke
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0136783_0137172	so i think it's better we go for uh um ordinary buttons
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0131930_0132233	i don't think it's gonna take long to to produce anyway
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0138886_0139061	i am agreeing with the usability
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0012470_0012730	actually for that i was just copying the one straight out of the other documents
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0135186_0135590	so if certain you know if it's a proper word
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0078439_0078909	but would it make the remote more usable for elderly people
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0092292_0092417	maybe yeah yeah
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0070024_0070319	it's my characteristic uh characteristic about the dolphin
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0045399_0045889	that you wanna see per topic you wanna see which one spoken most something like that
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0100849_0100972	okay
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0009682_0009830	i'm participant four i believe
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0108922_0109064	but you won't
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0009014_0009424	so is there a project documents folder
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0046985_0047241	it's got a good interface and easy to use
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0182876_0183163	do the p. d. f. s switch it to postscript switch it back to p. d. f. and then
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0091530_0091813	she told me i could just ch change it here and then it would
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0046472_0047301	suddenly if if if uh uh viewer he gets a telephone call and if he want he doesn't want to switch off the uh t. v.
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0187904_0188353	thought we would have another private thingy after this
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0155341_0156222	but i suppose even calculating the the w the the what's its faces themselves would be too much too long
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0206619_0207514	um our costs are below budget with recommendations that they the budget be increased but i think i don't know d what do you think
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0220271_0220456	but then yeah as i said how do you do it
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0022694_0023520	uh that's just uh the normal uh as th as the normal uh remote controls uh so um
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0153385_0153583	what it costs under twelve and a half euros
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0141783_0141896	change the cases
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0003057_0003385	well i've got a browser now which whoops
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0003404_0003804	good start
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0018493_0018818	you could see the time you know what show they want to watch
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0074427_0074693	i did in my directory just uh just do that yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0022303_0022415	well oh yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0207817_0207928	huh
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0114513_0115039	we change it to friday
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0130070_0130315	what the remote control is like
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0119829_0119979	writing it back to x. m. l.
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0087957_0088348	and it should be resistant to high as well as uh low temperatures
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0038191_0038361	yeah that's that's easy
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0018314_0018423	yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0117659_0117763	alright okay
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0078492_0079300	now that's particularly in relation to our market research findings about the spongy texture to the exterior and the fruit and vegetable design colours
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0013037_0013522	and she was challenged on that point
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0096272_0097238	uh thirty four percent of people take said they take too much time to learn to use and i think that ties in with the um the previous finding of people only using ten percent of the buttons
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0142112_0142400	okay so the highest we've got is the electronics here
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0132517_0132635	and then yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0193279_0193562	actually i was asking steve about that whether we can get in there
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0061278_0061447	uh yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0094685_0094872	okay one
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0026233_0026456	okay
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0173660_0174199	and correct back any he like things that i thought was wrong in english or whatever
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0130033_0130153	interface
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0103286_0103406	um apparently
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0184179_0184486	it's just uh u using uh your thumb
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0093342_0093493	uh-huh yeah
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0043656_0044399	now having used a remote control for years does anybody already have like an idea like things you didn't like with it
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0003664_0003952	minutes um we decided to use a kinetic charger
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0173304_0173568	yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0169712_0170288	no it's not um but i think if awareness was kind of brought to the forefront about that
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0125288_0125530	yeah that's what and that's what i think we like
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0142505_0142623	hmm right right
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0156649_0156753	we should have it done anyways
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0123581_0123733	just sh like w
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0179851_0180014	i think that's a three
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0062113_0062844	uh so uh you've got a lot of devi uh devices like uh d. v. d. uh uh television uh stereo
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0161756_0161905	innovative
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0051763_0052198	well i'll i'll check what it does on on um double click at the moment
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0039817_0039922	just for recognition
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0028023_0028142	um i don't know
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0111483_0111596	yeah yeah globally yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0143817_0144241	i'm sorry i've um forgot to do that um
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0222119_0222777	but an extended list of the of the meetings so you know you have b. d. r. whatever it was called o. one
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0044970_0045542	now the um we decided upon including certain features on our remote
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0174199_0174381	it like no
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0155884_0156315	um just to ask whether we need to have the evaluation done for the demonstration
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0152829_0153239	i think uh that's very important we have a few buttons
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0119481_0119693	but it has a slightly flattened bottom so it can sit
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0219973_0220141	yeah pen is here on the table
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0222551_0222719	having this kind of meetings
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0058247_0058379	number two yeah
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0137251_0137367	i think so as well
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0164930_0165079	mm yeah maybe you're right
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0099112_0099725	or just or is it more like right
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0002070_0002219	hello
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0027852_0028436	you always make me feel bad because uh when i go to bed at like one you're still online
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0089554_0089817	but depends on what we want
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0141930_0142143	maybe it's possible uh possibility
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0021965_0022709	and you can recall they can write the it writes the objects and then you call the objects back and they ha those returned objects have all the information that they need
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0106964_0107498	well that could be just uh like the scroll to eight click scroll to eight click scroll to eight click
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0148581_0148982	i think that is still a kind of a question mark issue how we deal with that
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0103977_0104086	alright
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0072563_0073206	well are you wanting to write that in directly or what what do you wanna do with that
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0052524_0052865	it's just very quiet
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0021210_0021426	um i've done some research
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0036880_0037334	uh as i said about the w which batteries we were gonna choose
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0053386_0053794	um uh let's see
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0067786_0068008	the colour's very attractive
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0194299_0194531	i think that's a pretty nice score
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0025298_0025776	and we've got our user interface designer
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0230146_0230659	or you can have a f text box there that's got yeah as you go over them
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0068805_0069665	but if m any of you guys know how we could do the like from the uh extract words that you did
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0209880_0210323	uh then a few small things
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0050738_0051294	and we have also included two buttons for scrolling up and scrolling down the programme channels
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0176364_0176543	oh oh right okay
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0049778_0049996	that's my dreadful that's the worst yet
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0013608_0013797	we've got forty minutes
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0133367_0133778	and all the transcript files have got the string i don't know what it is
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0075541_0075679	no
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0116388_0116511	rubber yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0115184_0115431	well no t like to load up like the thing is that i think
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0030576_0030860	one's percent noise and one is percent participation
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0034797_0035557	just keep it simple and well the docking station and small screen would be our main points of interest
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0097811_0098288	so if you scroll to a number and then you wait a half second then it g turns to that channel
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0071725_0071915	they're they're expensive they don't
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0069749_0070202	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0132102_0132203	yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0113138_0113402	mm i don't have any information on pricing
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0088968_0089266	but the it wouldn't be very robust
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0135087_0135349	i think this is a really easy one
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0066289_0066787	and then i changed it and run the thing again you wouldn't ever be able to load the objects back up
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0159909_0160355	because n. x. t. over the over the whole of the corpus was just not feasible
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0066792_0066942	tabs are nice
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0150982_0151470	so those are things maybe we wanna look at as far as saleability of the item
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0087170_0087588	you were loading like a new corpus each time for each meeting but you're doing the objects
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0095738_0095924	but it might have its cost implications
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0063991_0064404	so you've got the global one there and then here you can just have the top five in this meeting
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0061732_0062279	and so just say one of the boxes just explains does this is my top five dialogue acts for the speaker
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0187038_0187139	so that will be this
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0024337_0025195	you can have a menu instead of a button but this why i don't think it yeah
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0180192_0180428	yeah i think maybe we should do some research into
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0033821_0034404	i prodded it to see if it'd break but it didn't break too m i didn't play that long but um it seemed alright really yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0200781_0201493	is it d very difficult to make another another gui but only for a global search
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0064655_0064779	next slide please
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0157389_0157688	is it twelve point fif was it twelve point fifty
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0058954_0059174	we can just refer to this later can't we
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0123878_0124032	fee selling
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0143413_0143544	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0202772_0202979	yeah because in the start up screen you can't have a
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0005935_0006681	and then when you go on the menu you can select a summarisation box which pops up and an audio player
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0129377_0129503	but well anyway yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0107692_0108376	but then again that would be d j just pretty much not an option for older people who don't even know what a scroll wheel is
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0154203_0154315	for each do you see what i mean
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0254517_0254873	i'll write um i'll write this meeting up and i'll send it to pernilla as well
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0063909_0064125	so the light sensor would activate the signal
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0251148_0251339	well it wouldn't be a long meeting then
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0208880_0209062	from a single application
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0017785_0018043	like the thing is i was thinking even in the stuff that i was doing i mean
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0085700_0085982	and that you you say that won't add too much to the budget
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0029852_0030249	um most of them are powered by some form of battery
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0085748_0086228	no we want something original
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0130326_0130868	and then you can operate it from the third or th or second floor
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0038068_0038336	i think we should make a remote for the future
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0093454_0094252	um and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we don't have so many functions actually on the remote control
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0163447_0163714	so this these are just some thoughts i have on it
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0085499_0085694	i don't think we've really touched on that a lot
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0163372_0163537	i think that does make sense
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0098880_0099666	just just a quick thing about the um about what you're saying about the uh does does it need to be fashionable
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0005570_0005801	okay this our last meeting
AMI_IS1009a_H01_FIO087_0053067_0053246	are different shapes
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0272028_0272402	yeah just just just disregard it yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0164813_0165282	it would that was the whole point was to if you say this is your top one this is your bottom
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0151914_0152324	yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0120928_0121283	i wanted it to be comfy and roundy so we we've got that
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0053017_0053235	um would you like to continue on from that
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0208960_0209241	but most will probably want to go with defaults
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0063870_0064567	yeah i'd uh yeah i'd probably put it uh two yeah two or three
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0107490_0107720	that's true
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0070718_0070863	you want your rating to be a two
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0054854_0055307	now this is uh a special special feature which we have included
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0026037_0026206	that's about the new remote control
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0140381_0140763	thought it might be handy to put a battery status display on it
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0068484_0068929	i think it's a it wants to draw a another animal
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0065246_0065653	turn it upside down move it up up and down i really like that
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0274305_0274557	well that's sorta what is yeah that's true
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0012309_0012442	oh write the sum okay right
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0114281_0114818	i think th th those do tend to be the basic channel hopping things and on and off for the video fast forwarding
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0028670_0028789	it's an idea
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0078010_0078122	it's it was the old one
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0104986_0105181	if you push it three times
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0210877_0210998	would yeah
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0190040_0190371	and then if people really want more colours they can buy it separately
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0050792_0050952	who knows what back channel
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0100114_0100440	and the regular chip is not possible
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0093846_0093986	how to order it
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0108818_0109508	so if you have any ideas or if you wanna draw anything on the white board just ask and go ahead
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0162952_0163317	are there not too many functions uh among the functions
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0202466_0202569	to have for the start up
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0102431_0102558	i think we yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0142276_0142587	it's not a good friday if it's a deadline
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0024903_0025738	um so i decided i'd have a look at what th other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from that
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0039518_0039783	no
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0037960_0038448	okay now i'm gonna have to change what is was originally gonna be because that looks like a beak now so
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0153617_0153839	and how about the feel
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0007053_0007312	ooh there you go
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0190085_0190483	it's really borrowing from other areas it's you know bringing things from other areas in
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0060504_0060724	we could just make it up
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0187627_0187906	do you want that on the start up screen yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0083679_0083990	thank you just pull it closer a little bit
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0057900_0058505	yeah so this is one of the interface or one of the remote which has this vi voice recogniser
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0093518_0094012	the other thing is just ch chucking into mobile phone f design features again
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0090085_0090281	so we i guess we use one
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0174570_0174717	uh uh like other functions
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0188530_0188806	twendag sieven an twendag
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0124836_0125272	i mean that's gonna that could be yeah
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0036262_0037062	and according to to higher management the it should only control the t. v.
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0158669_0158815	twenty five isn't it
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0157274_0157747	is is that is that a part of the demonstration did they want that information the evaluation as part of yep
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0147756_0148224	i'm concerned when you read the the r. s. i. issue again repetitive strain injury
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0118818_0118949	and they're double curved
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0207905_0208061	yeah so
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0187312_0187486	mm monday afternoon
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0113883_0114458	so c did we have a date for when we actually want the system done
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0123383_0123515	but um
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0221477_0221637	if you go for both you're searching
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0215162_0215553	it's easier to bit nice to handle
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0097468_0098059	the chip uh controls the infrared bulb and perf perhaps a normal bulb
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0062575_0063003	in in that moment it has a sensor i it it gets a certain darkness
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0072892_0073178	but uh we're gonna have to narrow it down a little more
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0188848_0188969	actually it's difficult because
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0186520_0186655	the l. c. d. 's not cheap
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0170208_0170330	mm
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0074001_0074203	yes which can be easily recognised
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0196786_0197287	well if they're part of b. d. b. working group they're gonna wanna look at the b. d. b. ones and so we'd default to that
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0079543_0080152	so i'm just thinking before i give it my rating you were limited in the use of materials for your prototype here
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0117608_0117718	something like
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0174959_0175210	instead of f of less buttons
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0139867_0140423	just to express our l. c. d. screen a bit more
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0017917_0018314	um have you all seen the corporate website already
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0053812_0053941	although you c
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0164267_0164756	and i think we all agree on the case we wanna have something uh maybe bright colourful
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0008861_0009603	um the transcription box has got a summarise but button which doesn't do anything yet
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0040229_0040610	so i'm quite glad that it looks you know ni nice on one or this kind of thing
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0042426_0042675	so this is the one
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0084199_0084349	and it should be recyclable
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0060335_0061014	yeah now this is an interface for a chil uh for a remote uh uh which a child can use
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0139184_0139773	so in even in the dark the user can know what buttons to use to switch on a particular channel
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0092623_0092786	otherwise i'll i'll make up some m.
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0013878_0014055	the l the left click or the right click
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0073271_0073416	so um
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0193869_0194233	should be fancy to fancy design easy to learn
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0282559_0283107	or returns twenty even if it returns twenty do you cut off at ten do you rank them do you what's the threshold
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0183727_0184471	i think we we did uh in more than one respect and uh so i think we did very well here
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0124769_0124899	maybe it's just a day i don't know
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0020995_0021224	um we've done some market research
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0083866_0084550	so you can quite easily if your text area is called area you just do area dot set highlights or something you know
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0145518_0145969	otherwise you're gonna be s java trying to do s it was just so complicated it was ridiculous
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0047355_0047814	you'll have the menu right click it but instead of like have a default double click
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0102255_0102357	yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0110496_0110920	but whether whether or not because we'd have it in two separate units
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0132383_0133347	uh t the remote should be compact and it should ha it should have as many buttons as possible for controlling different functionalities of the t. v. television
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0147297_0147426	this is not familiar for them
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0156251_0156713	so we can s we can skip the display so uh we don't need it
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0024381_0024516	i know i know
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0076724_0076992	another question is like sorry
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0190169_0190674	but it doesn't really matter 'cause it never really runs out 'cause it lasts a long time once it is charged
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0027039_0028033	uh but um i thought in a few meetings earlier we uh uh tried to keep it uh simple
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0096094_0096748	so in that way we can cut cut the cost but w uh uh that we have to make the battery as rechargeable one
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0075138_0075610	and you know specifi you you will get specific um instructions for that
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0092783_0092912	yeah
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0050930_0051366	another thing is you have to be uh a bit slow
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0068745_0069236	no these the front buttons which are here are the mute buttons
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0080380_0080592	with menus yeah yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0154928_0155214	okay and second as already discussed with william
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0086443_0086588	but i don't know how
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0076547_0076744	yeah i haven't i haven't made any changes to it yet
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0063436_0063952	have an image in my mind and i just wanna see it on the thing and then get a nice screen shot
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0157287_0157809	because a speech recogniser like i it it has its own uh uh problems issues
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0066948_0067118	that's that's a really good good thing
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0193562_0193757	whether he was gonna get us access into the
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0202394_0202519	the room was yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0026919_0027039	okay
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0123298_0123436	um
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0029731_0030110	actually i noticed that no one is
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0104177_0104926	okay now i hope everybody has a little bit more insight in the functions we all have and what we are doing right now
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0064255_0064919	so purpose as william already said i would put it to simplify the interaction with t. v. to make make it as simple as possible
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0080874_0081304	so it goes in and highlights 'cause that's i know
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0150429_0150823	i did do it once i do have a java class that does it for something i don't know whether it'll work with this
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0049675_0050406	um the uh i found some uh something about uh speech uh recognition
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0183135_0183441	um did we new did we find new ideas
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0169656_0170315	although we had our separate tasks there was so much interaction so much that we needed to um bounce off each other
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0029420_0029974	now i should point out that the first of those findings fancy look and feel is the most important
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0081658_0082025	and finally the prototype he spoke about
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0124069_0124247	what does it mean if you put point five for that
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0141096_0141729	um they did have all that and it was sorta built in and just uh had some trouble getting it running properly
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0172030_0172181	is the design easy to use
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0104040_0104203	yeah it's a big advantage
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0059545_0059671	at the disfluenc okay
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0189054_0189228	well you cou um
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0153159_0153266	yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0195514_0195759	because it's a bit it has a bit of a angle
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0220154_0220323	oh yeah yeah the whistle ones yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0098501_0098936	i think uh that is uh f for rubbers that is uh yeah case material
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0137735_0138224	has that not made any d if you click off that square now has that not made any difference
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0068777_0068895	okay
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0127901_0128111	on the on on the remote
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0165633_0165800	that's gonna be quite a few pages
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0244396_0244498	uh i believe y uh
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0232559_0232680	i think it's time for us to
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0051832_0052603	we have to have as few buttons as possible because more buttons is more confusion so that's why i'm saying simplicity is good
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0133455_0134119	um which brings us a little bit back to marketing as well
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0049213_0049607	uh there's i can start from now
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0101994_0102510	that's an option we can then we're almost there
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0010093_0010200	i'll show
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0072814_0073649	as we saw we we have to make a profit also so we we can maybe go for an economies of a higher production mm by fifty million we said
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0193623_0193828	'kay
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0085913_0086188	and if you use less buttons
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0103476_0103651	that's fine
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0057092_0057577	uh by pressing down volume long or pressing down a a number
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0020992_0021379	i've written the topic segmentation one
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0060429_0060744	uh is
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0048445_0048674	here we have the single curves
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0142893_0143138	and they kind of respond to the turn of your body
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0181323_0181622	we're not gonna put any okay just a thought
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0246996_0247596	um although well i don't know 'cause it's the lab and try and get some work done for the the lab stuff
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0197899_0198437	i think probably elderly people would be a little bit more careful with their remote controls than
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0246398_0246596	hmm
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0215121_0215344	should be more bit more friendly yeah
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0141886_0142148	and i would encourage you all to do the same
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0003721_0003846	okay
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0100488_0101105	and uh you only have to design a remote once and if you use high tech materials it come back in every product
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0204238_0204421	yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0116994_0117621	so instead of the fascia that comes off being plastic the fascia that comes off would be the rubber
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0130485_0130598	by your child mm-hmm
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0042122_0042347	um the one present
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0241021_0241212	not very fun
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0215455_0215628	yeah maybe we could come at some say five
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0107984_0108254	you have to convert it to some sort of format i suppose
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0021934_0022335	um okay what are we going to do
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0142418_0142656	well it wasn't originally either
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0271207_0271446	yeah you do the n. x. t. so so it doesn't show up together
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0256898_0257262	then we'd know who's missed them or who's if we've done any
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0135305_0135407	oh yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0095345_0095469	yeah yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0017279_0017651	simple plus minus button
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0178399_0178669	then it didn't matter 'cause it was just another idea in the field
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0034749_0035495	and then if you i don't know click on that topic you get everything that's in that topic or whatever
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0153855_0154032	i have a friend there too
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0139058_0139344	yeah to do um what steve's talking about you do
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0098549_0098880	yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0099509_0099901	and then we have to interface push buttons
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0122353_0122857	i mean i thought we'd we'd just selectively selectively write the x. m. l. that we've got
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0069948_0070393	this brings the menu up on the screen and the orange ones are
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0244241_0244628	so do we wanna arrange this get this one earlier maybe
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0030163_0030404	it'd nice to have it inconnec interconnected like
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0132750_0133469	rubber buttons not tiny little one big rubber buttons but what about i mean 'cause we got to make it original
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0019400_0019512	um f. n.
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0190231_0190333	then it could cross highlight
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0129433_0129934	might do if we go for some of the more exotic aubergines and such like colours
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0193474_0193716	the bare board l. c. d. or
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0199279_0199946	that's very strenuous because your thumb is slightly up so they came up with something like this curled up so here
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0177980_0178441	yeah do you wanna you know just get together and think about the different types of search we could possibly do
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0257021_0257501	so can we just can we just r repeat briefly what we've spoken about
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0008621_0009142	uh after that we have to come to a decision on remote control concepts
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0146528_0146951	th the internal d engineering design has got to remain the same yes absolutely
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0095678_0095860	yeah like smaller
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0112622_0112798	how to use the scroll wheel
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0025097_0025633	people questioned uh indicated that they thought their remote were was ugly
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0063476_0063721	i mean that we can discuss that later you know
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0159803_0160156	it looks like we've got got ourselves a pretty good product
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0137664_0137928	so did you have to write it in the way that they wrote it is that what you did
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0213286_0213663	so you rather wanted to have a flip over
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0180749_0180961	we have to test it s but
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0022556_0022822	we had one hundred of these uh test subjects
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0056602_0056712	so some
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0057676_0057871	one point four or something like that
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0039387_0039590	i know
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0058505_0058736	unless um you can't hear it properly or something
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0053528_0054020	so which you know suggest maybe you can suggest a few that which which would be interesting to list
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0164008_0164164	seven pages
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0027508_0027939	and fifty percent of the people indicated that their remote tended to get lost in their room
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0082252_0082379	mm-hmm
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0076079_0076247	maybe we should to a different supplier
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0175844_0175990	oh and do we um
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0017532_0018012	so shall we keep the same uh line up as uh last time
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0097238_0097521	they just can't be bothered to learn about the other functions
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0195222_0195447	yeah just jazz it up a bit
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0183919_0184252	and you just press a button and the phone goes ringing
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0054362_0054579	uh see you have to do it real slow
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0005194_0005672	the case material is gonna be soft rubbery changeable
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0159520_0160519	we have we have earlier it was mentioned about um for example elderly people who have limited function with their fingers and hands
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0203619_0203867	oh right oh okay
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0018862_0019193	okay so shall we start with the first presentation
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0279167_0279738	but you have no ranking system at the moment so if something's an amazing w highly ranked thing from t. f. i. d. f.
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0252792_0252904	three's better than five or six
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0109768_0109931	would that imply video use
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0030633_0030899	i mean speaker characterisation tied into i don't know
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0060809_0061392	so i suppose later it depends if we want to undercut the price we d or or is it going to make our product look a cheapie cheapie option
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0005140_0005279	yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0165682_0166106	yeah include some more buttons and uh um yeah features
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0085663_0086259	ah but in my instructions i think it said i was supposed to go to the board and do something
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0024509_0024960	um most important thing is the fancy design
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0143060_0143427	the injuries maybe a touch screen could be a better option for that
AMI_TS3003a_H02_MTD0010ID_0101447_0101812	i'll just try something else
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0145395_0145574	yeah that is true
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0050494_0050799	how what kind of how l long can you get out of that
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0085527_0085761	it would be a be a pretty rigid one
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0003703_0003815	okay
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0137491_0137642	yeah sure
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0150288_0150408	these can be changed as well
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0083822_0084216	yeah but uh we have to stick to the twelve and a half euros
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0008382_0009196	um i'm sarah the project manager and this is our first meeting surprisingly enough
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0081515_0081690	and there should be a child lock
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0068080_0068370	i would give that a three
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0164048_0164176	okay
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0132084_0132683	yeah yeah 'cause that's the uh the declares a variable doesn't it and then they keep okay
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0120733_0121028	oh
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0160229_0160992	i'm the user and my family members are the user i will already record uh a question like
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0182307_0183125	there will be a customer service number thing that you can phone up and speak to and that way there's no call out charge
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0129404_0129617	yeah yeah you don't really need to do much more with it
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0163317_0163740	and are the those functions that are there are they useful
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0078967_0079783	i don't think you'd i think the it would d well you know how long the standard double a. s would last in or triple a. s would last
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0200585_0200849	i forget
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0193086_0193671	i mean we just uh we could break things down like that to that level of detail if we want
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0135848_0136057	one art student
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0128257_0128525	first as a first step and you return the meetings
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0222656_0223061	'cause i took it from the feedback you gave in the last meeting from y from y your report
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0134790_0135144	then you can do a massive amount of analysis on three people
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0030441_0031056	it just prints everything out in the in the shell as well like as it does everything it just kinda i guess that's its default behaviour anyway
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0205234_0205344	okay
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0133891_0134149	single curved is really easy to just fill in
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0130510_0130868	we need to use each other for those
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0088627_0088837	well it would certainly make a fancy design
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0094960_0095318	um first
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0117928_0118404	so you can see how the the yes no sort of varies across the age group there
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0148571_0149086	so what would the if we had the these fake topics what what would the what would they look like
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0126889_0127431	because it will increase cost uh signifi uh significantly
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0126718_0126828	yeah yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0135045_0135233	it would have to be attached
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0109230_0110041	so it will come up on the screen for the moment i haven't managed to put it into a vector or whatever in java to play with it
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0061158_0062113	yeah i i've been thinking about a simple manner uh to put a lot of functions uh uh in one um in one uh remote control
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0091362_0091506	that might be might be an idea
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0114442_0114592	today wasn't it
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0158504_0158755	yeah that's what i'm thinking too yeah
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0115695_0116236	uh and also there are uh um resistors uh sorry ther there is a diode
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0062635_0063079	although the thing is typically though is someone gonna have five windows open at the same time probably not
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0033214_0033502	then these are the this is the market
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0108608_0108739	can you go to the next slide please
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0177789_0177962	mm decide on that on over the weekend
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0162693_0163275	and besides that it's um if we're gonna focus on elderly people they'll have to adapt
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0191580_0192089	the k the f there's computer rooms in here the m. s. c. computer lab and uh is in here
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0148964_0149212	bunch of key words
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0226653_0226788	smartboard there it it
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0199278_0199452	maybe it doesn't happen at all
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0201029_0201159	okay fair enough
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0082114_0082502	um do we want separate result panes uh for each of those
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0201065_0201541	well no i'm just getting back to sorta what could be on the the start up screen
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0014437_0014850	um i'm not sure uh if we need the outline of the prototype
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0188370_0188958	yeah we talked about kinetic charging we've deci seem to have decided on that did we decide on double a. or triple a. batteries
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0034072_0034535	now uh we are ready for the presentation of the prototype
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0145900_0146161	okay
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0090559_0090965	yeah i'd uh i'd f i'd go for a five actually 'cause
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0019778_0020295	one that represents the meetings and the meet and the information about both is contained within each object
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0098268_0098462	uh but yes but
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0099725_0099959	oh right yeah exactly
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0041757_0042217	um this is certainly something to take into account
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0207915_0208053	well you are you are i guess
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0125139_0125328	it shouldn't it's not it's not too bad on that
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0042838_0043738	um alright now other things that i found out on in my research is that the complaints that people have about the remote controls that are out there now
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0158170_0158348	don't t. v. yeah
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0199316_0199966	because are we talking about elderly elderly people or people from forty to eighty
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0071824_0072571	um almost uh e all uh remote controls uh are using a on off button on that place
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0249998_0250371	we've all got cla well three of us have class at twelve
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0018894_0019151	yeah
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0072011_0072439	so you have a working design and then a functional design
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0211713_0211898	i think we need to tick the okay box right
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0133368_0133554	i was thinking of like ten
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0244644_0244766	five more minutes
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0133165_0133775	bet that would be a good yeah i think that d no that's that's a lot
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0002912_0003048	she gonna answer me or not
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0061241_0061469	they've got no text tool no
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0047031_0047163	so do you wanna do that then
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0076088_0076284	of course you can actually yeah it's got everything
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0155734_0156064	so these are the two things we should come up wit with
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0155570_0155756	uh maybe two yeah
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0199452_0200023	if money permits we can address some features for some subgroups within that
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0022987_0023159	okay yeah i see what you mean
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0058470_0058757	well if we're skipping the audio one and then things got easier
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0015365_0015769	so uh i suggest we take about seven minutes per presentation
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0088088_0088254	super size meeting browser
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0150380_0150789	and it's uh it's b uh less frightening i think
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0133822_0134090	we have um four euros yeah
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0148961_0149228	so that nobody else comes later and use it
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0177270_0177482	here's a little l. c. d. screen
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0202051_0202252	target the real elderly people
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0056716_0056932	right
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0190238_0190469	just a small screen with two
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0194037_0194480	yeah it's only got it's crap it's only got about four or five computers in but it would do quite good for our job
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0102253_0102750	'cause it well i don't know um just now but i haven't played around it that much
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0010362_0010480	i can hold it like
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0053586_0053930	so this is one of the very important feature a remote control can have
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0087192_0087460	we have the g big yellow one maybe
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0055554_0055657	do we wanna use them or not
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0166028_0166645	user interface concept uh interface type supplements
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0144537_0144643	but we should ask him
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0202399_0202522	it's all a bit bizarre really
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0177373_0177514	i had them worked out
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0118532_0118810	but that would also go for the l. c. d. screen then i guess
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0161877_0162283	you would be using your thumbs to press just like a mobile phone
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0026408_0026675	yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0031970_0032302	could i can i interject to ask a question there is that appropriate
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0018924_0019419	so it's like i don't know unless i wanna do something with this in the future
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0131805_0132583	um and also for electronics we can use a simple and regular um re or an advanced chip on the print
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0098570_0098725	d yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0119311_0119924	um well this is yeah but this is here the question was would you prefer it
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0077618_0077833	w m yeah so the
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0182205_0182421	and we used the slide because it was better positioned
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0090855_0091354	but you wouldn't want to compare the result the topic one topic result with one summary result would you
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0098896_0099689	um the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like um a liquid crystal display and speech recognition
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0133108_0133838	we can probably do that ourselves and just sort of b. d. b. you know just do a a string
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0019605_0019753	see if it works this way
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0124679_0124956	a very low quantity of rubber compared to plastic
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0157714_0157817	distance problem
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0067308_0067648	well let me know when when it's sort of usable
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0179020_0179123	like in a different you know
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0101923_0102499	and besides that you mentioned it would make the docking station obsolete
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0191635_0191834	forty one out of forty nine
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0089313_0089572	hit accurately the buttons in between
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0153532_0153701	so to keep it simple
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0034785_0035432	so a lot of interesting feedback there both from our market research departments and from our people in paris and milan
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0011664_0011891	to do with that already but we'll just go over it
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0200379_0200552	slightly curved curved
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0117392_0117667	i would greatly advise not to do it
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0058494_0058654	woah
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0060245_0060521	the cup cup shape here
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0128626_0128741	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0202490_0202650	because um hmm
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0221144_0221348	so you can uh
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0092196_0092783	does it talk to you now does it
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0168075_0168721	yeah we could do that but i'm not sure if that would be very good for the easy ease of use
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0128615_0128800	or is it just what's behind it
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0014843_0015002	um so yeah i was j yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0082453_0083439	indicated that older people spend their money easier more easy maybe it's feasible to just put the price of the remote up a little
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0202640_0203026	can you look into the company logo
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0009745_0009928	yep
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0029867_0030117	and teletext got a six and a half
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0077443_0077562	okay mm-hmm
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0196111_0197066	um having maybe larger buttons or buttons that light up or buttons that are slightly differently shaped for people uh either for children um
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0178402_0178668	yes yes you've done a good job
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0188300_0188413	oh just the item in
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0118367_0118669	do you know that it's been all a bit manic the last m the last yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0013106_0013608	then we will do the project uh evaluation and the closing after that
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0209408_0209642	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0169308_0169412	as a compound noun
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0084951_0085271	but then maybe that's looking at someone who's just sitting on their own rather than
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0244908_0245011	oh for next week
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0095446_0096325	we have to remember to include that in our evaluation how they did the gif improve your browsing experie
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0227452_0227764	and then i guess we'll start in thirty minutes again
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0170774_0171163	you could make it more complicated and make it do for th for the yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0155209_0155380	so twenty fourth so it we sh
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0086606_0086931	we could the only thing i could think of was an m.
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0141234_0141583	it will be necessary to have good help function as well
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0154275_0155070	however uh the decision we have to take in this meeting is who is our target group
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0059955_0060170	uh it's just one button
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0216266_0216811	um but i'm i'm unsure about how to how to put all the information in there
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0168915_0169188	um did you feel like a team
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0173753_0173939	that does not exist
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0212398_0213152	i think we've done very well to get within budget and it still makes such an innovative item that i think people are really gonna want
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0274023_0274217	it doesn't have to be all intelligent
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0041434_0041734	so then does this how does is how is this box populated
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0029177_0030124	the industrial designer is going to work on the working design uh components design and a bit of the look and feel design
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0171714_0172027	it's not like people trying to cut each other
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0030700_0030927	then there are some one time use function
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0026456_0026737	uh what should it come back as
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0216382_0216871	um l. c. d. display on th the top side of the flip top
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0006997_0007904	from everyone to see how she best could market uh this this product at the within the budget uh that was given
AMI_TS3003a_H01_MTD011UID_0147421_0147542	okay
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0053378_0053790	i thought it was u. v. like
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0184036_0184327	but for a remote he will just refer to the manual and all that
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0163548_0163860	so perhaps we should s stick to the basic layout
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0127378_0127795	well they did say it wasn't the most efficient
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0208436_0208731	do you really want multiple windows from a single lap
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0042029_0042437	i haven't done it i haven't updated all those object files though 'cause it takes ages on these computers
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0020295_0020877	so and then they wr it writes objects and the objects contain all the information about the meetings and the speakers
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0048363_0048767	then we have included one to nine buttons
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0111597_0111799	so d so let's say
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0148522_0148694	yeah
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0074229_0074411	yeah i i th i think
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0010851_0011071	and as you already know i am betty
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0037439_0038026	but um you know i would make them a bit nice if i had more time but at the moment it doesn't look like that
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0033420_0033651	yeah on the front on the front side of that yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0141567_0141760	i don't think so
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0193727_0194086	language we're looking for the l word language and get the highest rated ones
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0080875_0081185	i'll have t i'll have to move it won't i
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0037943_0038068	design
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0109501_0109808	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0125696_0125814	exactly yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0148244_0148497	one okay and be betsy
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0086484_0086645	when we threw it open to the field yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0091738_0092049	right okay
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0016966_0017340	um getting a better feel for all these nite objects
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0090063_0090305	it can do that fine
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0124458_0124617	yeah yeah
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0057762_0057892	i'm thinking about a swordfish
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0111239_0111597	because we don't wanna search um locally we wanna search globally
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0141775_0142195	and then it's kinda like there's usually things built in to well should be built into java
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0001346_0001673	so uh good morning
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0012988_0013135	ta da
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0184323_0184706	so audio signal should be possible as well
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0190479_0190598	ah yes we have time later but we don't
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0271599_0271853	oh yeah yeah it'll yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0064279_0064838	mm no design the gui first and uh 'cause it it w the problem is if you change the classes
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0013476_0013865	i'm bart the project manager so i'll direct you through the project
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0129140_0129293	oh it would be flat inside
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0020877_0021528	so that the who the speakers that are at the meetings and the amount they speak and then the averages are contained with the speakers
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0110175_0110677	s haunted white board
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0014097_0014616	um i don't think we have any great discussion at this point
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0101208_0102046	so it's in my idea it's uh it's gonna be smart to invest in di in design and not in uh in the product itself
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0073581_0073734	so that is eight
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0083182_0084080	if make it useable for more than one device it's a it's hard but i think it's possible but it uh yeah yeah yeah so it's it's okay
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0195571_0195821	and if we can yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0068274_0068805	um i think uh i was wondering about that is uh i haven't looked at it so much
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0145959_0146145	black and grey other colours as well
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0017338_0017486	t uh i wanted to talk about that actually
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0034404_0034674	and it the the th the start up's great looks quite good looks alright
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0014626_0014856	so you should probably look at the
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0125543_0125696	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0118703_0118805	yeah exactly
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0061802_0062025	that's what i feel as well
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0155687_0155789	two okay
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0174381_0174703	that's not that or whatever
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0226386_0226994	no but you know to to search for a u pecif pec specific user you have to hold your mouse over that one
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0196807_0196960	i just think it's better to do it afterwards
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0075352_0075888	unless can you i don't suppose you can minimise them and stuff like that can you can you do that
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0026955_0027532	it'll just shout out i'm here or something to similar effect
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0110038_0110335	right
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0044413_0044878	and and the button button's part uh will be explained by f francina
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0123998_0124113	next please
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0123125_0123299	and just um
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0032702_0032943	one hundred and sixty eight times per hour
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0091816_0091988	what kind of things do we have to consider there
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0144569_0145137	i gave up doing that completely and just defaulted back to n uh nite stuff 'cause it was much much much easier
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0039939_0040252	uh yeah and now we don't need uh leds or um
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0184062_0184390	ah yeah
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0071171_0071568	uh working design yeah it's it's uh mainly technical functional design
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0209491_0209673	yeah all the label twos yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0125566_0125997	just what you said i i didn't get the uh meaning of it completely you're saying like
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0107867_0108482	um the problem with the casing is that uh there's
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0017503_0017732	no that's fine that's fine
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0035556_0035682	yeah be good
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0136433_0136556	okay that's cool that's good
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0186440_0186706	i i you know let me know whenever
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0235508_0235796	it's the not right corpus and then you got not right elements in it
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0138503_0139147	we can customise the two circuits for different type of buttons like we are keeping the standard buttons on the top and the more complex buttons under this thing
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0047900_0048145	or maybe the speaker characterisation might get slimmer
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0084859_0085347	it's uh doesn't uh imply any technical restrictions
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0082870_0083007	okay right
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0049996_0050809	that's it's meant to be an eagle you can tell it's a flying animal could have been a seagull i never thought of a seagull
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0009601_0009826	yeah yeah i was getting that impression as well
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0155364_0155633	alright
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0028810_0029082	and remember you have to press so it works
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0035170_0035689	now the function of a remote is to send messages to the television
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0031293_0032097	and the decision that we took last time was that uh the special feature we would like to see is a speech recogniser
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0190431_0190658	i mean three three or after what
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0106358_0106545	you you have to use actions
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0035738_0036107	it's a good thing to have to say we cou what we could have done if we had more time
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0057459_0058127	it's uh possible to uh uh to make um quite cheap uh system for uh speech uh recognition
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0024362_0024997	it did actually say on the email that they were sort of coming in and they were fairly easy to get a hold of
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0064653_0064783	but it'd be good to have it there
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0197880_0198070	uh you can have a save preferences
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0131891_0132149	like just like yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0151710_0152186	if we if we're working to head office specifications as this is what this project team's working for
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0046539_0046695	they shouldn't break down easily
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0036119_0036880	now the main components i came up with um were obviously the power source for the batteries 'cause otherwise it's not gonna work
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0098059_0098324	when you press a button you can actually see your pressed button
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0073552_0074028	you're yeah but are you do you wanna change that m the original m. browser file then
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0005751_0006002	everybody found his place again
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0102290_0102604	w i thin yeah i think yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0192552_0192970	yeah some sort of docking station or yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0158226_0158339	five more minutes
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0109781_0110213	but i mean general t. v. controls do do video as well
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0026982_0027116	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0054498_0054741	because i sixteen
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0030752_0031064	fat a fat cat
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0146796_0147715	it's gonna be the same so we need to focus on just one thing not get bogged down in lots of different um possibilities um
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0166261_0166473	page is gonna be problem
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0141065_0141279	it could be in dollars
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0054476_0054921	has to be so great that they're gonna say uh twenty five euros isn't much
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0102731_0103149	just you know the re using code and stuff was just like okay good
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0102692_0102808	yes
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0057962_0058204	so what yeah it's this is bit of the swordfish
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0121635_0121783	yeah that's true yeah
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0149725_0150587	if we uh make a k a button ex for example for big subtitles which is instantly on the remote control
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0189594_0190013	like if they if they know exactly where they wanna go they wanna go to you know that meeting on december third
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0128388_0128951	so if if he want to view a particular programme at say nine o'clock he can set the time
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0214615_0215164	it's just all here and here is just go to wherever and a go button
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0137109_0137442	we'll just go for push buttons for in the interest of cost
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0127940_0128171	okay
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0106024_0106677	so um there are ways around it but you know whether i'll be able to figure something out like that till before tomorrow yeah i know
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0271446_0271683	either disregard it or put a weighting against it
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0168814_0168924	i don't know
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0105433_0105566	okay thank you
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0111508_0111638	put it into a window at least
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0032772_0033027	yeah yeah which just copied straight out
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0018003_0018170	that's a good point
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0186123_0186346	um what other functions
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0149676_0149785	on size
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0157798_0158314	yeah and i think today there are probably not many people who don't have a t. v.
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0232570_0232677	is everyone happy
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0026083_0026667	it's alright but uh
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0167535_0167757	so so what's that two weeks basically
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0146883_0147426	so the general score would that be a um for the whole of the language or the for all the whole of the corpus
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0145965_0146120	it's a good yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0111164_0111424	so that uh i think financing was pretty simple
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0115201_0115311	i guess that's not
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0080981_0081579	yep uh well i think that everybody's gonna say their remote control is practical
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0137000_0137171	richard's argument was very good
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0195004_0195515	on the bottom we were gonna have the rubber the rubber ones the anti r. s. i. ones
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0150440_0150541	shall i do that then
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0223369_0224053	we could do microsoft stylie and hold it over and it pops up a thing
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0165076_0165328	but i think there won't be very much buttons
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0084751_0085069	s um it's uh not uh in colour or something
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0091106_0091392	if there are more buttons then it will be more complicated
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0062032_0062575	at that moment it's it's like it's like um what you call it a light s sensors you know
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0161756_0162029	it will recognise my voice and will switch on
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0158787_0158889	well or besides it
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0026783_0026961	what's easiest to display on the screen
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0062365_0063158	i should uh you know at least very least have uh um a gui and uh wire i'll be wiring that in hopefully tomorrow morning
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0163776_0164224	'cause that that was just a bought on extra you could just take that out
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0070898_0071135	on your home directory not in the okay
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0015303_0016034	that has infra red bits and it has an interface controls w interface that controls the chip
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0101936_0102270	and then there's some if statement saying s straight on the you know
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0201327_0201462	was there room for creativity
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0049850_0049965	okay i see
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0002271_0002425	uh good afternoon
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0041920_0042435	we t you know ah yeah we managed that nicely
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0040278_0040500	and to have a different menu for our
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0051055_0051227	right
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0045327_0045670	uh i think the most frequently used buttons should be emphasised
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0206234_0206344	in uh every country
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0021224_0021610	we distributed some more enquetes questionnaires
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0083604_0084156	i have one one m one little question that i reckon we should have a little icon for our browser
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0201997_0202359	the way you h hold of it's kind of semi circular in the bottom something like that
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0168333_0168547	sounds good
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0189165_0189312	do you want like a back up
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0095286_0095859	that's all we need the one case uncurved flat single curved double curved
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0076024_0076748	yeah i mean just keep it simple as
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0062821_0062982	okay well um
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0075518_0075806	so simplification of symbols you could think of
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0134649_0134767	yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0225035_0225419	obviously it'll have a logo on it just like everything but everything else has a logo on it
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0214271_0214736	um the project has been evaluated well and truly
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0102459_0103250	the the main problems with the well you could go for wood but i think it would be a bit impractical
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0098356_0098896	you know those small movements of the remote control can lead to kind of shoulder and elbow problems
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0184862_0185309	well thing is you know if yeah something like that could happen anytime 'cause uh yeah
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0097647_0097780	yeah yes
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0171189_0171295	yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0165402_0165877	it's not a channel it's not when it finishes it's not anything like that it's just a number
AMI_TS3003a_H02_MTD0010ID_0143042_0143150	nope
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0215917_0216096	mm-hmm
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0036132_0036419	y we have to first define what what happens when you click on a user
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0052198_0052354	'cause i think it might do something
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0094226_0094356	is that's what we're using
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0123433_0123820	if you press the volume button you can control the volume with the scroll wheel
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0066770_0067159	oh yeah well but then those people we can't help everybody
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0052829_0053345	maybe it should different colours or materials or you know
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0083778_0083904	um
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0132456_0132604	so let's try it
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0072255_0072883	well i have one question uh will there be anything written on the buttons
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0148901_0149184	well i wouldn't design a telephone but
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0163566_0163798	do that as well that'd be really nice yeah
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0026467_0026733	um in addition remotes were not very functional
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0125292_0125439	and not innovative
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0161177_0161402	yeah yeah yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0181831_0182425	you know that it sits in then pressing the button then having so we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0118064_0118366	yeah one of them and one sample sensor and sample speaker
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0119607_0119842	it's not exactly wires we are using
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0007473_0008027	so after this you will be uh free to go and uh spend all your money
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0264093_0264561	if if if they're looking for like i say sunny day and
AMI_IS1009a_H01_FIO087_0080408_0080526	okay
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0064779_0065694	now this is a big over sized remote which cannot be misplaced or it's impossible to misplace
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0110964_0111441	so you have a but button on your docking station which you can push and then it starts beeping
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0119796_0120427	more diffi it was it wasn't marked but it was i had to sit there and think about it for a bit which is a bit irritating
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0075365_0076057	i mean calculators you don't really throw around a lot whereas remotes you do they can t
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0218169_0218366	do we need another meeting this week
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0020970_0021307	it's an excel s s. x. dot x. s. l.
