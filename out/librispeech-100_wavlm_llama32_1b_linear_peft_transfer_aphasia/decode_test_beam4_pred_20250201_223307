fridriksson07a_296.74_3.11.wav_ASR	and then then he says
fridriksson07a_300.171_4.5.wav_ASR	but it in the middle of the night i woke up and and i recognized him
fridriksson07a_305.064_0.46.wav_ASR	and i said
fridriksson07a_306.357_2.93.wav_ASR	you're snoring and i needta go to the bathroom

fridriksson07a_360.712_4.76.wav_ASR	they were helpless you know because they said you know sometimes
fridriksson07a_365.98_3.24.wav_ASR	because i lost control of everything though really
fridriksson07a_369.808_0.89.wav_ASR	it was really bad
fridriksson07a_373.4_2.59.wav_ASR	well there i was there for a week
fridriksson07a_377.916_4.02.wav_ASR	and so they called the army

fridriksson07a_388.494_2.53.wav_ASR	and we were taking care of our doctor's house
fridriksson07a_391.627_6.21.wav_ASR	because she was down georgia then because she was working there just for one year year
fridriksson07a_398.159_3.0.wav_ASR	and she got her p j so then she's traveling
fridriksson07a_401.878_2.74.wav_ASR	and so he said

fridriksson07a_438.04_2.71.wav_ASR	or my husband gave me a shower and everything
fridriksson07a_440.771_2.14.wav_ASR	and then we went on to the other hospital
fridriksson07a_443.23_1.41.wav_ASR	but they were very good too
fridriksson07a_444.686_2.19.wav_ASR	who i stayed at the university
fridriksson07a_447.397_6.8.wav_ASR	why stayed at the hospital stroke clinic for
fridriksson07a_456.3_2.82.wav_ASR	and i think i was in there about three weeks
fridriksson07a_462.218_4.06.wav_ASR	but they had their own section where they did it for all the stroke victims
fridriksson07a_467.107_4.77.wav_ASR	and then i got in the wheelchair and and i said
fridriksson07a_472.02_3.83.wav_ASR	don't want those legs that you you put your legs in
fridriksson07a_476.555_1.66.wav_ASR	and i put my feet on the floor

fridriksson07a_488.923_2.87.wav_ASR	yeah i ran over that hospital in the wheelchair
fridriksson07a_491.814_4.36.wav_ASR	well they wouldn't meet the floor but they was a big floor you know
fridriksson07a_497.438_3.59.wav_ASR	so i but i was there for a long time
fridriksson07a_501.709_2.11.wav_ASR	but i i think three or four weeks
fridriksson07a_503.871_1.97.wav_ASR	and then i was discharged
fridriksson07a_505.858_4.21.wav_ASR	and then i hadta come back for therapy three times a week
fridriksson07a_519.422_3.589.wav_ASR	well we did physical therapy

fridriksson07a_539.154_3.42.wav_ASR	because up here i could add like crazy and i still can
fridriksson07a_543.361_1.97.wav_ASR	but to get it out i can't do it
fridriksson07a_546.994_0.36.wav_ASR	the end
fridriksson07a_552.553_5.4.wav_ASR	and i can say it sometimes but when i write it down it is just jump up
fridriksson07a_559.385_8.25.wav_ASR	if if i can add up to one thousand ninety nine i might put down nine thousand ninety
fridriksson07a_573.324_1.49.wav_ASR	that was three years ago
fridriksson07a_575.777_2.22.wav_ASR	and the other one i knew nothing about it
fridriksson07a_578.016_3.11.wav_ASR	but they said there was a former one a smaller one
fridriksson07a_586.492_1.93.wav_ASR	yeah i didn't even know i had it
fridriksson07a_597.83_0.48.wav_ASR	okay

fridriksson07a_866.611_0.63.wav_ASR	they're really
fridriksson07a_868.979_2.65.wav_ASR	okay then he walks outside and it's raining
fridriksson07a_871.65_3.54.wav_ASR	he doesn't have the umbrella or he would put it up right
fridriksson07a_876.373_1.0.wav_ASR	he comes back in

fridriksson07a_908.344_2.97.wav_ASR	and the looks like the father went after it
fridriksson07a_913.497_3.77.wav_ASR	and the little girl's standing there ready to catch him i guess
fridriksson07a_917.394_1.71.wav_ASR	and she was riding her bike
fridriksson07a_921.067_0.67.wav_ASR	and somebody
fridriksson07a_922.129_1.97.wav_ASR	oh here's a dog barking up the tree
fridriksson07a_924.145_1.83.wav_ASR	and they called the fire department
fridriksson07a_928.923_1.59.wav_ASR	so they'll get the cat out right
fridriksson07a_932.955_6.92.wav_ASR	and i couldn't understand what the ladder's for but i guess the guy climbed up the ladder and got in the tree and then the ladder fell
fridriksson07a_954.76_0.34.wav_ASR	yes
fridriksson07a_958.107_4.76.wav_ASR	oh i think the last time i read it for years ago
fridriksson07a_975.646_0.54.wav_ASR	oh okay
fridriksson07a_1095.08_12.54.wav_ASR	well the the thing of it is that that cinderella she was under the control of her stepmother and two stepsisters
fridriksson07a_1108.411_2.15.wav_ASR	and they treated her like a maid
fridriksson07a_1111.509_4.88.wav_ASR	and then they were having a ball at the
fridriksson07a_1117.065_3.86.wav_ASR	that's what she was looking out the window at the castle and everything
fridriksson07a_1121.443_6.61.wav_ASR	and then when they decided they wouldn't let her go because she would be in competition with the two sisters
fridriksson07a_1129.018_3.57.wav_ASR	and then a fairy godmother came
fridriksson07a_1133.326_5.58.wav_ASR	and got her all dressed and everything and ready to go to the ball
fridriksson07a_1139.72_2.4.wav_ASR	and gave her a pair of slippers
fridriksson07a_1143.746_8.07.wav_ASR	and she went to the ball but she hadta be back by twelve o'clock
fridriksson07a_1153.31_1.67.wav_ASR	and so she was dancing
fridriksson07a_1155.0_4.63.wav_ASR	and the the prince chose her to dance with
fridriksson07a_1159.677_2.02.wav_ASR	and i guess he fell in love right away
fridriksson07a_1162.249_4.76.wav_ASR	and then the clock struck twelve
fridriksson07a_1167.86_3.01.wav_ASR	and she ran out but she lost the slipper
fridriksson07a_1172.448_1.9.wav_ASR	and then they found the slipper
fridriksson07a_1174.419_9.12.wav_ASR	and then by the time she got back her her chair had turned to a pumpkin
fridriksson07a_1184.579_1.19.wav_ASR	what is it called
fridriksson07a_1185.919_1.97.wav_ASR	okay now let me think a minute
fridriksson07a_1188.29_6.09.wav_ASR	and so they were going all over looking for the person that lost the slipper
fridriksson07a_1194.4_3.25.wav_ASR	and they came back to cinderella's house
fridriksson07a_1198.045_4.27.wav_ASR	so they tried it with the two stepsisters and it didn't fit
fridriksson07a_1203.12_4.56.wav_ASR	so then they asked cinderella to try it
fridriksson07a_1207.7_1.21.wav_ASR	and they were just
fridriksson07a_1209.733_1.54.wav_ASR	oh no she wasn't even there
fridriksson07a_1211.295_5.34.wav_ASR	but when they turned it on then fit
fridriksson07a_1217.703_5.54.wav_ASR	so they took her back to the the palace
fridriksson07a_1224.46_4.25.wav_ASR	and the she married the prince
fridriksson07a_1231.895_1.51.wav_ASR	and i don't know
fridriksson07a_1233.591_1.89.wav_ASR	and i guess she lived happily ever after
fridriksson07a_1235.5_2.72.wav_ASR	all stories like that
fridriksson07a_1250.689_2.41.wav_ASR	oh well first you get the peanut butter out

kansas04a_29.341_0.86.wav_ASR	please tell me about it
kansas04a_30.225_7.48.wav_ASR	it's february twenty eighth in ninety eight
kansas04a_42.61_11.38.wav_ASR	well my stroke started on one night and i did not think it was too bad
kansas04a_54.764_1.58.wav_ASR	well sorry now actually
kansas04a_56.809_9.79.wav_ASR	and then i went out with my friends and they were concerned because i was driving aggressively
kansas04a_68.079_9.21.wav_ASR	and she said that i drove too close to cars and i had difficulty with my speech
kansas04a_77.957_5.16.wav_ASR	and i went home and i met my husband at the local watering hole
kansas04a_84.83_3.35.wav_ASR	and had a drink and i went home
kansas04a_88.529_5.344.wav_ASR	that was not my usual way of doing
kansas04a_95.153_1.87.wav_ASR	don't talking to anybody or anything
kansas04a_97.072_3.29.wav_ASR	and so i went home and i went to bed that night
kansas04a_100.589_2.91.wav_ASR	and i got up the next morning and went to work
kansas04a_104.276_4.63.wav_ASR	and went to a a chamber meeting
kansas04a_109.508_10.63.wav_ASR	and i parked and went in and when i came back out i noticed that i'd parked very badly
kansas04a_121.372_4.48.wav_ASR	and i went to work and then one of the girls came in and said
kansas04a_126.873_2.64.wav_ASR	you're not using your arm correctly
kansas04a_131.007_0.4.wav_ASR	and i said
kansas04a_131.688_1.2.wav_ASR	and i think i'm having a stroke
kansas04a_133.315_0.93.wav_ASR	call the doctor
kansas04a_134.744_8.79.wav_ASR	and she told me to go to the emergency room and not to drive
kansas04a_144.096_13.82.wav_ASR	and at that point i was confused enough that i was thinking about the ambulance across the street from my office
kansas04a_158.827_1.8.wav_ASR	so i'd drive myself
kansas04a_161.92_1.11.wav_ASR	so i drove myself
kansas04a_163.284_3.31.wav_ASR	and i got out there parked in the proper place
kansas04a_167.312_3.2.wav_ASR	and went in and and then i met my husband there
kansas04a_170.986_6.08.wav_ASR	and i told him to tell them what what i thought
kansas04a_177.562_3.58.wav_ASR	because i could not communicate at that point
kansas04a_182.356_4.06.wav_ASR	and i was there for overnight and they sent me home
kansas04a_187.406_9.41.wav_ASR	and then i did not feel well the next morning so i i had him take me back to the hospital and i stayed for couple of weeks
kansas04a_207.011_5.1.wav_ASR	well i had therapy and all my speech and writing
kansas04a_213.604_6.17.wav_ASR	but they didn't give it to me for very long
kansas04a_220.931_5.04.wav_ASR	and i was just when i was in the hospital i had my speech and and writing therapy
kansas04a_226.382_3.15.wav_ASR	and then i got home and had some physical therapy
kansas04a_259.052_0.729.wav_ASR	the story
kansas04a_263.423_8.6.wav_ASR	well when i got married the first time i hadta a plan my whole wedding myself because mom was much older
kansas04a_273.102_2.34.wav_ASR	and she left it up to me
kansas04a_276.529_5.33.wav_ASR	and i went home and then went back to firstnamel
kansas04a_281.881_3.75.wav_ASR	and i got married in firstnamel and firstnamed's chapel
kansas04a_294.955_9.48.wav_ASR	and we had dinner and then we went to back to the hotel
kansas04a_304.94_3.42.wav_ASR	and my umbrella married me
kansas04a_309.335_2.86.wav_ASR	he's a methodist minister
kansas04a_313.018_7.98.wav_ASR	and his wife took over the bathroom didn't get let my sister in there
kansas04a_322.108_15.2.wav_ASR	and so then we went to the chapel and on the way my brother inlaw was driving and he almost rushed us
kansas04a_342.23_1.91.wav_ASR	and i think that will be enough for that story
kansas04a_369.621_4.36.wav_ASR	well this little boy is practicing his soccer ball
kansas04a_376.048_2.66.wav_ASR	and then he kicks it through the window
kansas04a_379.812_1.49.wav_ASR	and it breaks the window
kansas04a_382.375_3.03.wav_ASR	and it goes into this man's house
kansas04a_386.256_1.9.wav_ASR	and he's very startled
kansas04a_389.349_6.47.wav_ASR	and he gets up and looks out the window to see where it came from
kansas04a_396.096_10.7.wav_ASR	now it does not tell you whether the boy ran away or whether he came and confessed that he had kicked the soccer ball
kansas04a_435.24_4.79.wav_ASR	mother wants the little boy to take the umbrella
kansas04a_443.068_1.73.wav_ASR	he doesn't want to take the umbrella
kansas04a_446.585_4.68.wav_ASR	so it goes out and it starts to rain of course as his mother had told him it would
kansas04a_452.243_1.56.wav_ASR	so he goes back
kansas04a_454.24_0.91.wav_ASR	and she tells him
kansas04a_455.171_1.15.wav_ASR	and he's very wet
kansas04a_457.426_5.56.wav_ASR	so we goes back in the house and she's very angry with him because he hasn't taken the umbrella
kansas04a_463.777_7.44.wav_ASR	so in the last picture he has the umbrella and it's up and he's walking very happily
kansas04a_506.81_1.84.wav_ASR	well the cat is in the tree
kansas04a_510.155_1.81.wav_ASR	dog is barking at the cat
kansas04a_513.126_4.38.wav_ASR	and the little girl is crying because her cat is in the tree
kansas04a_519.099_8.07.wav_ASR	and her father tried to get it with a ladder and the ladder has fallen down
kansas04a_527.276_4.41.wav_ASR	and the father is still in the tree and he's looking very gloom
kansas04a_532.649_2.56.wav_ASR	and the birds are singing
kansas04a_537.485_4.46.wav_ASR	that's rather queer is everything else is going on
kansas04a_542.482_5.22.wav_ASR	and the firemen have been called and they are going to hafta get the cat down
kansas04a_547.988_3.8.wav_ASR	but i think before they do they'll hafta get daddy down
kansas04a_576.487_1.57.wav_ASR	there has been a flood
kansas04a_582.466_4.23.wav_ASR	and this lady has been swept away in the flood
kansas04a_590.504_12.69.wav_ASR	and this gentleman in the jacket is coming to rescue her
kansas04a_604.912_6.77.wav_ASR	it's been swept away in the flood also it looks to me
kansas04a_613.723_13.02.wav_ASR	and i do not quite understand this part
kansas04a_634.622_1.22.wav_ASR	yeah i think i am
kansas04a_636.851_1.21.wav_ASR	now what is that
kansas04a_643.48_6.31.wav_ASR	yeah but which one is being rescued and which one isn't
kansas04a_661.844_0.6.wav_ASR	oh yes
kansas04a_668.087_0.84.wav_ASR	not terribly
kansas04a_688.588_0.82.wav_ASR	okay
kansas04a_756.402_5.91.wav_ASR	the story is about cinderella and a wicked stepmother and her two half sisters
kansas04a_762.492_0.68.wav_ASR	and i know yeah
kansas04a_763.997_11.67.wav_ASR	her stepsisters were very unkind to her and her stepmother was too
kansas04a_776.051_5.38.wav_ASR	and cinderella was left to sweep and clean and do whatever they wanted done
kansas04a_782.592_7.02.wav_ASR	so they got a ladder inviting the house to the the ball
kansas04a_791.424_5.37.wav_ASR	the mother said that cinderella could not go
kansas04a_798.1_1.62.wav_ASR	and she was very upset
kansas04a_800.608_12.89.wav_ASR	and so she tried to get her dress together and the two stepsisters tore it apart
kansas04a_815.132_22.74.wav_ASR	and so she went out and told her fairy godmother that they had torn it apart and she wasn't going to go
kansas04a_837.925_6.54.wav_ASR	and and she was crying and and the fairy godmother said yes she could
kansas04a_845.377_4.79.wav_ASR	got her dress and with her wand of course
kansas04a_850.747_14.83.wav_ASR	and so the step stepmother and stepchildren started out and she did not go with them
kansas04a_865.963_15.24.wav_ASR	but she went in the carriage that the fairy godmother had confiscated out of a pumpkin and mice and horses
kansas04a_881.57_0.95.wav_ASR	the horse is the
kansas04a_883.45_2.91.wav_ASR	and she went to the ball
kansas04a_887.004_4.42.wav_ASR	and the prince greeted her at the ball
kansas04a_892.03_1.55.wav_ASR	and they danced
kansas04a_893.647_1.85.wav_ASR	and then it was a twelve o'clock
kansas04a_895.645_2.1.wav_ASR	he hadta be home by twelve o'clock
kansas04a_897.799_2.56.wav_ASR	so she ran out and lost her slipper
kansas04a_901.571_7.85.wav_ASR	and she went and got in the carriage and of course the carriage all collapsed
kansas04a_909.825_1.47.wav_ASR	and she went home
kansas04a_912.607_9.82.wav_ASR	and then the following week or so time elapsed
kansas04a_922.783_10.71.wav_ASR	the footman was sent out with a slipper to find which girl in the kingdom had fit
kansas04a_934.46_7.29.wav_ASR	and she was locked in her room so she could not get to the come down
kansas04a_942.65_2.64.wav_ASR	and she was very upset
kansas04a_946.239_4.44.wav_ASR	and he said
kansas04a_952.096_3.38.wav_ASR	and anyway the the mice ladder out
kansas04a_957.72_3.9.wav_ASR	and she came down and and of course she fit the slipper
kansas04a_962.075_1.87.wav_ASR	but the other did not
kansas04a_972.186_1.4.wav_ASR	yes
kansas04a_981.336_5.42.wav_ASR	and i would get two pieces of bread the peanut butter and the jelly
kansas04a_988.038_1.31.wav_ASR	and then i would get a knife
kansas04a_990.452_4.73.wav_ASR	and get some of the peanut butter spread it on one piece of bread
kansas04a_995.9_4.73.wav_ASR	and spread the jelly on the same piece of bread
kansas04a_1001.062_1.38.wav_ASR	and then put the drop on it
kansas04a_1005.16_3.55.wav_ASR	oh yes i've had practice

kurland04b_285.546_0.94.wav_ASR	he was outside
kurland04b_286.501_2.07.wav_ASR	and he kicked the ball inside
kurland04b_289.17_4.27.wav_ASR	and it it knocked over a lamp
kurland04b_294.053_5.06.wav_ASR	and his father was angry

kurland04b_302.676_5.89.wav_ASR	he picked up the ball and looked through the hole at his son
kurland04b_324.62_0.7.wav_ASR	okay
kurland04b_325.478_5.62.wav_ASR	the boy was walking or was leaving his house
kurland04b_332.737_2.95.wav_ASR	and his mother wanted him to take the umbrella
kurland04b_335.708_1.08.wav_ASR	and he said no

kurland04b_339.461_2.31.wav_ASR	his mother wasn't too pleased
kurland04b_342.508_3.26.wav_ASR	and while he was walking to school it started to rain

kurland04b_388.147_1.2.wav_ASR	he had a ladder
kurland04b_389.936_2.71.wav_ASR	and he climbed up on to the branch
kurland04b_392.665_2.29.wav_ASR	and the ladder fell over
kurland04b_395.678_2.92.wav_ASR	and someone called the fire department

kurland04b_502.933_10.18.wav_ASR	firstnamec's father married a woman who had two children
kurland04b_514.207_23.16.wav_ASR	and so the cinderella stepsisters and her stepmother made cinderella clean up after everything
kurland04b_537.717_2.96.wav_ASR	he hadta wash the floor
kurland04b_576.021_10.95.wav_ASR	and so the the two stepsisters weren't going to allow cinderella to come
kurland04b_588.209_21.45.wav_ASR	so after they left for the ball cinderella fairy godmother came and wished her into a pretty ball gown gown
kurland04b_610.285_3.9.wav_ASR	and the pumpkin pumpkin changed into a carriage
kurland04b_614.697_6.21.wav_ASR	and the rats or mice turned into the horses
kurland04b_621.488_7.74.wav_ASR	and her fairy godmother told her she hadta be back home by midnight
kurland04b_629.955_4.56.wav_ASR	and so she went in the the carriage
kurland04b_636.078_5.33.wav_ASR	and at the ball she met the prince
kurland04b_641.783_1.09.wav_ASR	and they dance

kurland04b_652.338_6.83.wav_ASR	and as she ran away her one of her glass slippers fell
kurland04b_659.969_1.51.wav_ASR	and the prince picked it up
kurland04b_663.127_2.45.wav_ASR	and so then he he
kurland04b_665.948_6.29.wav_ASR	it was the only way that he could find her was through the the glass slipper
kurland04b_672.358_3.3.wav_ASR	so he went to everyone's house

kurland04b_686.985_3.17.wav_ASR	and the mice came and gave gave her the key
kurland04b_691.051_8.14.wav_ASR	and then the prince tried the slipper on the two stepsisters
kurland04b_699.268_6.01.wav_ASR	and their feet were too big for the the glass slipper
kurland04b_705.772_6.16.wav_ASR	and then cinderella came out of the the closet of the room
kurland04b_711.953_4.78.wav_ASR	and and the glass glass slipper fit her
kurland04b_717.438_7.39.wav_ASR	and the prince and cinderella lived happily ever after

kurland04b_743.279_3.94.wav_ASR	and i would get out the peanut butter and the jelly
kurland04b_747.695_7.73.wav_ASR	and then i would spread one slice with peanut butter and the other slice with jelly
kurland04b_756.291_5.4.wav_ASR	and then i would put the two pieces together
kurland04b_762.256_2.42.wav_ASR	and cut it
kurland04b_764.991_0.62.wav_ASR	and eat it
kurland04b_770.477_0.39.wav_ASR	oh

kurland05a_430.627_6.75.wav_ASR	and probably went to nine hours you know and with an ambulance in the afternoon for a half an hour
kurland05a_439.185_11.7.wav_ASR	and in my therapy i i told the my therapist you know i was a child you know and a prior life probably to the stroke
kurland05a_450.9_1.92.wav_ASR	what do you try to help me with that
kurland05a_453.377_9.07.wav_ASR	and the only way i could i could really focus and i i could use the coffee cards you know for what's gonna say
kurland05a_463.012_4.16.wav_ASR	or i could have written a paper you know like a can speech
kurland05a_467.738_5.68.wav_ASR	but i i was not able to really talk you know one of them that you're you're and i don't remember

kurland05a_486.35_2.39.wav_ASR	and i just couldn't get on the same wave waving

kurland05a_515.462_0.671.wav_ASR	what's getting bigger
kurland05a_554.732_7.46.wav_ASR	well i have had many things happen but i'll say one of the that that involved my stroke
kurland05a_564.856_3.3.wav_ASR	my stroke took place april fourth
kurland05a_568.92_6.03.wav_ASR	and my physical year ended october first you know for my singing stuff
kurland05a_575.71_0.86.wav_ASR	and it was i said

kurland05a_578.401_1.34.wav_ASR	five months to go
kurland05a_579.76_4.27.wav_ASR	oh i was had on all my caguar's
kurland05a_584.704_4.17.wav_ASR	so i i wanna trip to a college springs
kurland05a_589.765_1.96.wav_ASR	and the stroke
kurland05a_592.346_2.85.wav_ASR	and then my my wife didn't wanna go
kurland05a_595.53_1.56.wav_ASR	well i took one of the sun
kurland05a_601.36_2.91.wav_ASR	and they're the other thing
kurland05a_604.371_11.19.wav_ASR	when i got up to accept the award i i started crying
kurland05a_622.298_0.93.wav_ASR	and that's what they do
kurland05a_624.482_0.93.wav_ASR	and never useta cry
kurland05a_630.564_8.41.wav_ASR	but you know it's just something that they came along the stroke
kurland05a_639.446_6.27.wav_ASR	and that's you know as you're gonna see it continued to stay with me
kurland05a_649.2_2.38.wav_ASR	and it's raining
kurland05a_653.67_4.13.wav_ASR	and here a major race at a funeral
kurland05a_662.527_0.85.wav_ASR	so that's my wife
kurland05a_666.225_1.64.wav_ASR	and it's right here
kurland05a_668.408_6.34.wav_ASR	because you know i'd be with a crack of a joke or something during the you know the playing game
kurland05a_674.801_6.03.wav_ASR	and you know it's very very accurate
kurland05a_685.515_3.9.wav_ASR	oh no no it was too difficult
kurland05a_690.856_2.46.wav_ASR	and you know watched the tv show you know
kurland05a_695.249_3.53.wav_ASR	it might be something stupid like the basketball
kurland05a_700.718_10.62.wav_ASR	if i come in a watch is show and you know they have a cinderella scene whatever you know i look over her and she's sitting there and i'm i'm crying
kurland05a_712.137_5.12.wav_ASR	and and i don't like them much anyway but you know i can't get over
kurland05a_717.971_2.22.wav_ASR	it's it's very done
kurland05a_722.507_2.3.wav_ASR	well it's a bunch of my people friends
kurland05a_725.084_2.06.wav_ASR	the news and a computer
kurland05a_727.159_0.59.wav_ASR	oh
kurland05a_736.401_0.79.wav_ASR	knock knock
kurland05a_767.64_0.42.wav_ASR	okay
kurland05a_768.713_6.43.wav_ASR	well this comes to right on the roof because i play soccer for for a mess
kurland05a_775.731_4.04.wav_ASR	and the first picture shows a young girl playing soccer
kurland05a_780.772_0.81.wav_ASR	he kicks the ball
kurland05a_781.6_6.34.wav_ASR	and he must be too close to the house because he put a bird right there
kurland05a_789.212_6.9.wav_ASR	and as luck would have it the homeowner was sitting right by the window to get smashed
kurland05a_796.131_4.91.wav_ASR	and he knocked the lamp over and smashed it
kurland05a_801.46_2.26.wav_ASR	well so it did kind of similar damage to us
kurland05a_804.612_7.97.wav_ASR	and the last picture shows the homeowner you're holding the soccer ball and looking out the window at the guy
kurland05a_812.6_5.26.wav_ASR	so i can only imagine what happened on the picture if there was one
kurland05a_855.661_3.73.wav_ASR	well i guess it shows a woman and a probably her son
kurland05a_860.063_1.44.wav_ASR	and he wants to go outside again
kurland05a_862.307_0.51.wav_ASR	but she's
kurland05a_862.998_2.06.wav_ASR	take your umbrella you know where you go
kurland05a_865.108_1.27.wav_ASR	and he's he didn't wanna take it
kurland05a_867.751_2.56.wav_ASR	and she offered it to him twice i guess
kurland05a_870.393_1.62.wav_ASR	and i still take it
kurland05a_872.035_0.74.wav_ASR	and he goes outside
kurland05a_872.828_3.42.wav_ASR	and the third picture shows a get dressed
kurland05a_876.326_4.09.wav_ASR	and the fourth picture shows it's getting drenched even worse you know
kurland05a_882.162_1.98.wav_ASR	so he goes back inside soaking wet
kurland05a_884.93_0.85.wav_ASR	and mother she said
kurland05a_885.939_0.89.wav_ASR	well i told you so
kurland05a_886.879_5.12.wav_ASR	and the last picture shows him with a umbrella like he should have had the first place
kurland05a_903.958_0.5.wav_ASR	and they're easy
kurland05a_916.499_3.08.wav_ASR	well eventually the cat climbed the tree
kurland05a_919.6_3.77.wav_ASR	and and as cats are bringing it down to the tree
kurland05a_925.566_9.21.wav_ASR	and a home owner or somebody you know a mail tried to get up the tree and he couldn't get the cat down either
kurland05a_936.567_1.42.wav_ASR	the girl's crying for a cat
kurland05a_939.74_3.82.wav_ASR	oh the reason the guy is getting down there because the ladder fell down
kurland05a_944.348_0.99.wav_ASR	so he's stuck in the tree
kurland05a_945.353_5.63.wav_ASR	and the dog you bark at the cat and the the garden
kurland05a_951.07_3.66.wav_ASR	so i guess we know why the cat is up in the tree
kurland05a_955.677_6.53.wav_ASR	and then it shows the fire department coming to get the cat down from the tree and the guy
kurland05a_965.049_1.31.wav_ASR	what's the this one
kurland05a_992.053_3.05.wav_ASR	oh my son watched cinderella way up
kurland05a_997.143_0.83.wav_ASR	you you want it
kurland05a_998.255_3.97.wav_ASR	you watched all the all the disney movies you know over and over again
kurland05a_1003.251_2.88.wav_ASR	and i mean not not once or twice i mean
kurland05a_1008.346_1.36.wav_ASR	four fifty five times yeah
kurland05a_1011.908_1.15.wav_ASR	most of it me
kurland05a_1016.878_9.9.wav_ASR	well i watch so many moves with cinderella but
kurland05a_1041.624_0.32.wav_ASR	who is it
kurland05a_1045.64_1.219.wav_ASR	and i thought
kurland05a_1049.637_0.39.wav_ASR	okay
kurland05a_1129.285_5.26.wav_ASR	well i'm gonna give you my version it's gonna be very short
kurland05a_1136.092_2.46.wav_ASR	it starts off with the girl
kurland05a_1138.93_1.73.wav_ASR	and i think she has two sisters maybe
kurland05a_1140.678_8.22.wav_ASR	and she's the least favored of the the three even though she's the knox out of three
kurland05a_1150.4_1.95.wav_ASR	her mother is even worse
kurland05a_1152.368_6.1.wav_ASR	you know i i can compare with the evil godmother always
kurland05a_1159.027_3.22.wav_ASR	and you always
kurland05a_1163.206_2.53.wav_ASR	and anyway she wanted to go to the ball
kurland05a_1165.752_0.99.wav_ASR	well she couldn't remember
kurland05a_1166.764_5.58.wav_ASR	well some of she she got to go to the ball
kurland05a_1172.459_3.71.wav_ASR	and at at the ball there's a prince there
kurland05a_1177.292_2.11.wav_ASR	and i think it's a slipper
kurland05a_1179.426_3.52.wav_ASR	and he tried to slipper around the every girl there
kurland05a_1183.783_5.14.wav_ASR	and as lock would have it cinderella you know fit in the shoe
kurland05a_1190.594_3.78.wav_ASR	and anyway i hope i'm come to the
kurland05a_1194.524_3.16.wav_ASR	so i think you know they're happy ever after
kurland05a_1201.033_0.43.wav_ASR	the end
kurland05a_1220.688_0.84.wav_ASR	and that's pretty easy
kurland05a_1222.699_3.27.wav_ASR	and i would take the bread on that nice box
kurland05a_1227.109_5.61.wav_ASR	and i use only hard breads because that's healthier for my son
kurland05a_1234.237_4.55.wav_ASR	and i can tell you because i had been making lunches for six months now
kurland05a_1239.613_1.78.wav_ASR	and every tuesday has the people going there
kurland05a_1241.442_5.12.wav_ASR	and i always said get a whole piece of bread
kurland05a_1247.075_1.39.wav_ASR	laying out the the table
kurland05a_1249.538_2.64.wav_ASR	and on one i put the jelly
kurland05a_1252.921_0.81.wav_ASR	he lost his rain
kurland05a_1254.656_4.23.wav_ASR	and then i put a spicy stuff spread on another side
kurland05a_1259.156_3.63.wav_ASR	and i put the piece of bread together
kurland05a_1262.831_7.23.wav_ASR	and i cut them four pieces because that's too big
kurland05a_1270.32_5.5.wav_ASR	and then i little bags they you know put it in
kurland05a_1275.84_2.65.wav_ASR	and and close the the sandwich in the bag
kurland05a_1278.506_3.21.wav_ASR	and i'm ready to go
kurland05b_50.075_4.4.wav_ASR	my speech is as i just said it's probably you know
kurland05b_56.5_10.98.wav_ASR	if we're gonna a range of one to ten and ten be in my stroke it probably ranges from three or four to seven
kurland05b_68.384_18.84.wav_ASR	and depending on you know how much sleep i had and you know what i did the day before and you know how i feel and you know it can barely say you know on a high side or seven or you know down as low as three or four
kurland05b_97.474_0.39.wav_ASR	oh yes
kurland05b_101.171_8.37.wav_ASR	my stroke occurred on sunday april third at the time it was
kurland05b_110.667_3.95.wav_ASR	people three and people four in the afternoon
kurland05b_115.886_5.05.wav_ASR	was taking my son firstnamek for a ride in the truck
kurland05b_121.942_7.89.wav_ASR	and sometime during the ride about you know around right and it just didn't feel very good
kurland05b_131.038_7.6.wav_ASR	and it didn't feel good
kurland05b_138.764_4.16.wav_ASR	and i i knew something was wrong but that's just temporary
kurland05b_144.024_7.14.wav_ASR	so not told on my wife but didn't say anything to my wife the rest of sunday
kurland05b_151.185_2.78.wav_ASR	and you know that night i went to bed early
kurland05b_153.981_3.23.wav_ASR	and next morning's monday
kurland05b_158.031_2.08.wav_ASR	well i went to work and you know like normal
kurland05b_161.057_5.69.wav_ASR	and driving to work because my right side was affected
kurland05b_166.826_2.53.wav_ASR	at the left side stroke from my right side is affected
kurland05b_169.989_2.67.wav_ASR	we kept dripping out the cinderella
kurland05b_173.568_4.83.wav_ASR	and i got on a mass pike from springfield to new york state
kurland05b_179.316_1.64.wav_ASR	and it kept going over the rubber strip
kurland05b_182.108_9.76.wav_ASR	and then i i knew couldn't talk anyway because i i i know it but just had something on my my speech and you know my verbal thing
kurland05b_191.892_5.03.wav_ASR	so i i picked up some corn seed that i sold these two farmers

kurland05b_207.883_1.73.wav_ASR	and drove down to sinai and i got
kurland05b_210.089_2.3.wav_ASR	and a singing thing happened down there
kurland05b_212.464_1.61.wav_ASR	is going up the right
kurland05b_215.133_5.91.wav_ASR	down the cinderella and went right up a sidewalk with my truck
kurland05b_221.891_4.39.wav_ASR	at that point there i i figured it was something's you know drastically wrong
kurland05b_226.335_2.1.wav_ASR	so i i was home

kurland05b_761.996_4.72.wav_ASR	and the dog chased the cat up a tree
kurland05b_768.041_7.81.wav_ASR	and then her father or some older gentleman tries to get the cat down from the tree
kurland05b_776.416_4.18.wav_ASR	and then the ladder falls down from the tree so he's stuck too
kurland05b_781.781_5.59.wav_ASR	and then the fire department's coming with a second ladder to get the the guy down and the cat down

71-1_14.65_0.62.wav_ASR	what would be
71-1_16.35_1.349.wav_ASR	would be the one to bring up
71-1_17.699_11.7.wav_ASR	you know i could just talk about the year that well nine months really when i was living in copanagua when i was nineteen
71-1_29.979_4.84.wav_ASR	and i did a seminar
71-1_38.11_8.87.wav_ASR	back in my generation you could actually go for two semesters which is what i did which is nine months
71-1_47.68_7.67.wav_ASR	what i did when i got to copinah and we had this arrangement which you could take classes at the university
71-1_56.18_2.36.wav_ASR	for the first semester i took class
71-1_59.16_2.453.wav_ASR	we had classes for four days of the week
71-1_61.8_1.661.wav_ASR	and three days of the week we could travel
71-1_64.1_7.4.wav_ASR	the second sister because i met this woman who became my best friend and it was her idea she said
71-1_71.94_4.16.wav_ASR	you know we are our education is really holding us back
71-1_76.94_18.32.wav_ASR	so i think what we should do is we should with draw from the university take our tuition money because we get most of it if you with draw from the first week put it in interrails and then just spend the time traveling
71-1_95.93_13.06.wav_ASR	so i would say for those four months in which i actually had a drama therapy room that i could go back to when i needed to decompress i got to irlington
71-1_110.29_3.419.wav_ASR	marocco is far south as we go
71-1_113.771_4.08.wav_ASR	italy france scotland
71-1_119.131_2.676.wav_ASR	we spent a fair amount of time traveling overseas
71-1_121.911_2.231.wav_ASR	when you're nineteen it's a really good time to travel
71-1_124.491_2.854.wav_ASR	really good looking boys everywhere that you go
71-1_127.345_11.955.wav_ASR	and yeah i just had the most incredible large vacation describe the fact of my mother said
71-1_139.525_1.2.wav_ASR	what's happening outside the school
71-1_140.804_1.257.wav_ASR	oh that's terrible
71-1_142.165_0.882.wav_ASR	you will not go back
71-1_143.59_1.381.wav_ASR	oh no i'll go back next time
71-1_144.971_4.28.wav_ASR	oh but this is my opportunity to really travel a lot
71-1_149.791_2.56.wav_ASR	yeah as my friend firstnamem said to me
71-1_153.351_1.62.wav_ASR	our parents are back in wisconsin
71-1_155.291_0.913.wav_ASR	what are they gonna do
71-1_156.204_0.947.wav_ASR	we're in korean
71-1_157.791_1.89.wav_ASR	we're just gonna tell them what we're doing
71-1_160.22_5.0.wav_ASR	so if i could tell you other stories but they would probably be sense
71-1_165.44_2.1.wav_ASR	so we won't go to all the details
71-1_174.46_3.52.wav_ASR	and i'd say it was irland because i met my fiancé
71-1_178.1_6.44.wav_ASR	my my father's family was only two generations from immigrating to the united states
71-1_184.94_5.88.wav_ASR	and there in brown's stone which is in the western county of gall state
71-1_191.32_5.02.wav_ASR	and so i actually meet with other second cousins
71-1_196.572_2.608.wav_ASR	that's not what the exact relationship is
71-1_199.432_1.95.wav_ASR	but i met people that were part of my family
71-1_201.692_7.006.wav_ASR	and i'd universities or second or third cousins that looked exactly like my father and my uncle's
71-1_209.352_4.804.wav_ASR	oh yeah that was the little easiest on standing i think yeah
71-1_236.89_0.84.wav_ASR	it comes and goes
71-1_238.25_4.65.wav_ASR	and i would say that the main problem with my language is that it's unreliable
71-1_243.73_5.13.wav_ASR	as i said a few minutes ago i was talking about going up
71-1_249.84_4.21.wav_ASR	and what's interesting is that it's the colors that i have issues with
71-1_254.46_2.14.wav_ASR	and i could not say umbrella
71-1_257.12_1.089.wav_ASR	and i think i said a stroke
71-1_258.58_0.629.wav_ASR	and then i said
71-1_259.68_6.89.wav_ASR	well i was really thinking in my brain how to walk around that or figure that out or feel that out on my own
71-1_267.01_2.96.wav_ASR	and i continue with it
71-1_270.27_1.84.wav_ASR	and i didn't invite that happening
71-1_272.61_2.16.wav_ASR	you better than i was
71-1_275.11_5.22.wav_ASR	and i still have difficulty with complicated concepts
71-1_281.15_1.54.wav_ASR	and i still i'll
71-1_282.906_4.581.wav_ASR	now that i haven't been always been confusing to other people
71-1_287.466_3.295.wav_ASR	and i do remember back what it was like when i was teaching before the stroke
71-1_291.106_1.62.wav_ASR	and people would look puzzled
71-1_293.566_0.577.wav_ASR	and that was like
71-1_294.446_0.82.wav_ASR	well that's their problem
71-1_295.586_5.857.wav_ASR	one of them they look puzzled a lot of times i'm pretty sure it's because i said something that didn't make sense
71-1_301.443_11.647.wav_ASR	so i'm still trying to work on explaining complicated things to people and trying to correct myself when i make a mistake about the other
71-1_313.523_6.04.wav_ASR	and i do continue speak on a regular basis
71-1_319.736_1.86.wav_ASR	so it's frustrating
71-1_321.916_8.864.wav_ASR	but i keep practicing it to the point that many people don't think i have aphasia until they do notice that i have aphasia
71-1_331.276_5.44.wav_ASR	so i can communicate but not well and not the way that i useta be able to communicate
71-1_347.09_0.959.wav_ASR	oh very much
71-1_348.131_1.199.wav_ASR	yeah better about it
71-1_350.191_0.82.wav_ASR	oh
71-1_357.66_4.863.wav_ASR	well i didn't know that it was a stroke which is very tip
71-1_363.04_1.71.wav_ASR	but then i had one before so
71-1_364.78_1.964.wav_ASR	so how would i know what a stroke was
71-1_366.88_4.114.wav_ASR	well i was epileptic working out
71-1_371.1_1.984.wav_ASR	it was january first
71-1_373.42_4.0.wav_ASR	that was a day when i you know that's the day when the rescue started
71-1_377.8_1.688.wav_ASR	well i hafta get out there
71-1_379.52_2.533.wav_ASR	and i needta start working out again harder than i ben
71-1_382.16_0.893.wav_ASR	and i was at a job
71-1_384.16_2.555.wav_ASR	and i worked the hell out man
71-1_386.84_1.385.wav_ASR	and i mean i think i did eight miles
71-1_388.82_3.88.wav_ASR	and my heart rate was up to a hundred and seven
71-1_393.18_0.64.wav_ASR	and going
71-1_394.24_0.819.wav_ASR	and you keep this up
71-1_395.34_2.9.wav_ASR	and i wasn't tired
71-1_398.62_0.92.wav_ASR	it wasn't fatigue
71-1_400.16_11.482.wav_ASR	and i got off the epileptic and had double vision and then died i would walk for two more miles mostly because the black pantacher was on
71-1_412.0_1.26.wav_ASR	peanut butter
71-1_413.3_0.677.wav_ASR	but that was on
71-1_413.977_4.84.wav_ASR	and i thought i wanted to watch it because really like chat with her
71-1_419.837_1.766.wav_ASR	who but i was fixing up
71-1_422.137_2.144.wav_ASR	and again i had double vision
71-1_425.157_2.023.wav_ASR	oh i just didn't feel good anymore
71-1_427.66_7.131.wav_ASR	went home and had a thunderclap headache right on my right side
71-1_434.94_0.52.wav_ASR	and i just said
71-1_435.94_1.381.wav_ASR	well i'm no idea what that
71-1_437.76_2.145.wav_ASR	so i've crossed it and then slept
71-1_440.66_2.93.wav_ASR	the next day i couldn't work it on
71-1_443.78_1.7.wav_ASR	well i'm trying to read a conference program
71-1_445.86_0.64.wav_ASR	nothing would work
71-1_446.77_1.3.wav_ASR	and i couldn't do work
71-1_449.31_3.735.wav_ASR	so i went to get my head my hair cut the next day
71-1_453.11_3.247.wav_ASR	and i wanted to cancel because i had a really bad headache
71-1_456.67_2.13.wav_ASR	but if you hadta pay for it
71-1_459.29_1.889.wav_ASR	and my hair really be cut
71-1_461.93_0.942.wav_ASR	oh i
71-1_462.93_1.662.wav_ASR	and i live alone
71-1_464.592_2.463.wav_ASR	so i didn't really talk to anybody in two days
71-1_467.512_1.658.wav_ASR	down in the chair
71-1_469.572_2.734.wav_ASR	and i couldn't tell her how i wanted to get my hair cut
71-1_473.192_2.18.wav_ASR	and i couldn't say
71-1_476.352_4.42.wav_ASR	so i couldn't tell her that i'd been wearing sunglasses
71-1_481.512_1.76.wav_ASR	and i don't know what was coming
71-1_483.692_0.608.wav_ASR	and i was told
71-1_484.66_2.06.wav_ASR	and she's like nodding and smiling
71-1_486.78_1.691.wav_ASR	but she had no idea what i was talking about
71-1_489.8_0.46.wav_ASR	well i said
71-1_490.62_1.01.wav_ASR	well something's wrong
71-1_492.54_1.8.wav_ASR	so i told her
71-1_494.62_0.3.wav_ASR	and i said
71-1_495.129_0.678.wav_ASR	like your hair
71-1_497.02_2.56.wav_ASR	so she luckily she didn't have hysterics
71-1_499.94_1.89.wav_ASR	but she cut her hair the way i
71-1_502.08_0.3.wav_ASR	and i said
71-1_502.46_3.93.wav_ASR	you know better go call a doctor because this doesn't make sense
71-1_507.5_2.1.wav_ASR	so i i i try
71-1_510.16_4.24.wav_ASR	and i think this is something that must happen with people that have strokes is that they
71-1_516.46_3.62.wav_ASR	it looked up the number that i was supposed to call emergency clinic
71-1_520.22_1.589.wav_ASR	and this was already six o'clock at
71-1_522.35_2.64.wav_ASR	and it had all of these twins
71-1_526.21_3.46.wav_ASR	if it's an immediate emergency go call nine one one
71-1_530.13_0.33.wav_ASR	and i thought
71-1_530.61_0.757.wav_ASR	that's
71-1_531.59_3.737.wav_ASR	well i just kinda make an appointment and go into the urgent clinic tomorrow morning
71-1_536.11_0.706.wav_ASR	and then it said
71-1_537.11_3.2.wav_ASR	if it's this situation called
71-1_540.703_4.014.wav_ASR	and if it's this situation call you know press three
71-1_545.023_2.16.wav_ASR	and if it's this situation called
71-1_548.083_3.82.wav_ASR	and apparently if you stayed on for two and a half minutes they finally say
71-1_552.343_1.811.wav_ASR	real person will come on the line
71-1_555.283_1.601.wav_ASR	but my head really hurt
71-1_557.243_0.593.wav_ASR	and i'm just going
71-1_557.903_1.16.wav_ASR	well this isn't really
71-1_559.46_2.24.wav_ASR	so i hung up the phone and said
71-1_561.9_1.13.wav_ASR	well i'll just get up tomorrow morning
71-1_563.38_2.36.wav_ASR	and i'll see if anybody will answer the phone
71-1_566.68_1.06.wav_ASR	but i told my daughter
71-1_568.34_4.12.wav_ASR	and she she was very frightened
71-1_573.0_0.6.wav_ASR	two sisters
71-1_573.7_1.12.wav_ASR	don't sound like yourself
71-1_576.13_1.22.wav_ASR	you needta go take an ambulance
71-1_577.9_1.29.wav_ASR	now i'm gonna pay for an ambulance
71-1_579.24_0.78.wav_ASR	and it's such ridiculous
71-1_580.52_1.22.wav_ASR	yes
71-1_581.84_0.82.wav_ASR	and just have a headache
71-1_582.9_2.28.wav_ASR	and i don't wanna spend that much money
71-1_586.02_6.16.wav_ASR	and she and her partner they called the fire department
71-1_592.48_0.8.wav_ASR	he's in minneapolis
71-1_593.56_2.263.wav_ASR	and she's just finishing school up there
71-1_596.04_2.585.wav_ASR	and she they called the fire department in madison
71-1_598.625_1.419.wav_ASR	and and they said
71-1_601.165_2.74.wav_ASR	physically this is
71-1_604.725_1.16.wav_ASR	well this is her sister
71-1_606.385_0.335.wav_ASR	and they said
71-1_607.54_1.23.wav_ASR	it sounds like she's having a stroke
71-1_609.285_2.315.wav_ASR	and she needs to get to the emergency
71-1_613.76_1.04.wav_ASR	and and they said
71-1_614.845_1.205.wav_ASR	but she doesn't wanna go
71-1_616.36_0.52.wav_ASR	and they said
71-1_616.96_5.542.wav_ASR	all of a sudden i know is i'm getting ready to teach something
71-1_623.14_4.643.wav_ASR	and i hear people running up the stairs outside my apartment
71-1_628.28_4.927.wav_ASR	and just looking firemen by the
71-1_633.62_2.12.wav_ASR	it must be the university
71-1_636.04_0.645.wav_ASR	and miserable
71-1_637.365_1.928.wav_ASR	and i answered the door
71-1_639.285_1.265.wav_ASR	and i told them that
71-1_640.825_1.38.wav_ASR	well i didn't have
71-1_642.545_1.252.wav_ASR	we didn't know what was going on
71-1_644.165_1.173.wav_ASR	but i couldn't talk
71-1_646.805_1.205.wav_ASR	you needta come with us right now
71-1_648.285_0.355.wav_ASR	and i said
71-1_648.745_0.913.wav_ASR	well no i'll take it
71-1_650.705_0.335.wav_ASR	and they said
71-1_651.417_0.908.wav_ASR	you can't drive
71-1_653.105_1.585.wav_ASR	well i'm gonna go to morrow tomorrow
71-1_654.885_1.437.wav_ASR	oh no you're gonna go with this right now
71-1_656.32_0.62.wav_ASR	oh my gosh
71-1_657.32_0.817.wav_ASR	oh alright
71-1_658.28_2.28.wav_ASR	let's like let me get my coat and all the other stuff
71-1_660.88_3.715.wav_ASR	and all of a sudden i got into the emergency room
71-1_664.74_1.961.wav_ASR	it was just this huge
71-1_667.8_1.86.wav_ASR	it was racing around and yelling
71-1_670.22_6.1.wav_ASR	and all of a sudden they called me in for a cat scan and came out and said
71-1_676.5_1.02.wav_ASR	yeah you had a stroke
71-1_678.32_2.727.wav_ASR	so i asked the doctor or something
71-1_681.06_3.681.wav_ASR	and he showed me on the cat scan exactly what had happened
71-1_685.44_3.23.wav_ASR	and they addict
71-1_689.38_2.962.wav_ASR	and so that's how i found out i had a stroke
71-1_692.75_6.56.wav_ASR	yeah i i really had no issues what's so ever with my muscle feet weak
71-1_699.81_1.65.wav_ASR	my head i'm my nose
71-1_702.78_2.04.wav_ASR	and i just didn't know about the headache
71-1_705.03_0.95.wav_ASR	we've never had one again
71-1_706.88_1.18.wav_ASR	never had my phone
71-1_708.53_7.93.wav_ASR	but apparently if you get a really really bad headache that hits you on the side of the head it means you should probably go to the emergency room
71-1_717.45_2.54.wav_ASR	oh i don't know if that gave you
71-1_720.582_1.363.wav_ASR	it doesn't give you a lot of insurance
71-1_722.34_8.435.wav_ASR	and i immediately right after i had worked out when i had the headache it's possible that they could've stopped it
71-1_731.3_3.77.wav_ASR	and at point the window of opportunity hadta
71-1_737.18_5.617.wav_ASR	but it wasn't a ischemic stroke not a hemorrhagic stroke
71-1_743.84_6.846.wav_ASR	and it immediately decided it was critical because they've not been able to find out why i had it
71-1_751.22_7.24.wav_ASR	all of my numbers are medical numbers are good
71-1_758.94_0.8.wav_ASR	and i'm not dying back
71-1_760.32_0.82.wav_ASR	and i don't smoke
71-1_762.02_1.88.wav_ASR	and i have a little blood pressure
71-1_764.42_2.25.wav_ASR	everything looks
71-1_767.76_1.39.wav_ASR	but i didn't have a stroke
71-1_769.54_2.64.wav_ASR	so something happened somehow
71-1_772.78_3.16.wav_ASR	and and in the hospital i got to watch the insurance
71-1_776.46_0.954.wav_ASR	and it just
71-1_780.18_0.96.wav_ASR	yeah right
71-1_781.58_4.48.wav_ASR	yeah so yeah so two years later here
71-1_797.2_17.56.wav_ASR	well again and if i ever get to the point that i'm particular enough about this i'm going to use my physical sense and and research and do something more about getting people some kind of treatment
71-1_814.772_2.553.wav_ASR	and i was given almost nothing
71-1_817.552_3.086.wav_ASR	partly i think it was because
71-1_820.772_2.485.wav_ASR	and it really madison wisconsin is a major city
71-1_823.472_6.42.wav_ASR	so i should've been able to get the best type of help available
71-1_830.372_0.477.wav_ASR	and i did
71-1_830.849_4.78.wav_ASR	and the best i could get was we found two speech therapists
71-1_836.569_2.232.wav_ASR	one of them only specialized in children
71-1_839.189_1.351.wav_ASR	so i didn't work with them
71-1_840.909_0.92.wav_ASR	the other person
71-1_842.229_4.18.wav_ASR	and it's literally one hour a week more than
71-1_847.59_16.523.wav_ASR	and basically because i am an academic because i have the ability to read competent texts and because that part of my brain wasn't hurt informed with in anyway i hadta do my own research
71-1_864.29_2.08.wav_ASR	and i hadta do a lot of research to get aphasia
71-1_866.55_4.28.wav_ASR	and the the speech therapist it was not psychotherapist
71-1_871.09_0.612.wav_ASR	they're different
71-1_872.39_3.118.wav_ASR	and she i mean she helped me a lot i would say
71-1_875.61_2.902.wav_ASR	so i should be looking up this particular thing
71-1_878.63_2.25.wav_ASR	and i should be looking in the type of tom
71-1_881.53_3.02.wav_ASR	and but she hadn't kept up with it either
71-1_884.71_4.16.wav_ASR	so she hadn't learned about some of the most recent treatments that were available
71-1_889.53_7.52.wav_ASR	so basically what i did is i went back to exercise as soon as they allowed me
71-1_897.35_2.7.wav_ASR	three months
71-1_900.34_5.67.wav_ASR	and i could only walk because they were concerned that my physical activity had something to do with the stroke
71-1_906.42_0.66.wav_ASR	and she said
71-1_909.64_1.189.wav_ASR	well i just hadta walk
71-1_911.14_1.081.wav_ASR	and i hadta
71-1_913.2_1.401.wav_ASR	it tested me for al fl
71-1_914.74_3.28.wav_ASR	and i hadta wear this for about three months
71-1_918.17_2.86.wav_ASR	but i don't have a phone either so
71-1_921.33_2.315.wav_ASR	but i focused on driving
71-1_924.37_4.82.wav_ASR	really wasn't drinking much alcohol at all then anyway
71-1_930.27_1.38.wav_ASR	well i stopped to comply
71-1_932.87_2.66.wav_ASR	and so now i'm back exercising as much as i can
71-1_935.83_2.18.wav_ASR	and i'm really careful in terms of my diet
71-1_938.49_7.52.wav_ASR	and i really focus on immigration limiting it in terms of my diet and what i
71-1_947.57_2.29.wav_ASR	and i write every day
71-1_950.51_1.38.wav_ASR	and i journal every day
71-1_951.89_3.934.wav_ASR	and right now i'm trying to write a article which i hope to get published
71-1_955.824_20.3.wav_ASR	because that's maybe the hardest thing for my brain that i've hadta do before the stroke or after is the ability to wave arrangements together in a really dense wellritten type of of organization
71-1_976.405_1.819.wav_ASR	so i'm trying
71-1_978.345_9.56.wav_ASR	and i read aloud every day the newspapers because i think singing words is a way of relaxing those
71-1_988.605_2.865.wav_ASR	whether it's the fires that were there
71-1_991.665_2.454.wav_ASR	and i just needta learn relearn how to say a word
71-1_994.405_0.82.wav_ASR	laughing
71-1_995.479_4.388.wav_ASR	and i'll probably be able to say that a lot for a long time until a week
71-1_999.919_4.279.wav_ASR	and then i'll miss pronounce that one again
71-1_1005.119_5.531.wav_ASR	but that's really all i know to do is keeping it up in terms of
71-1_1011.439_0.611.wav_ASR	and sleeping
71-1_1012.379_2.191.wav_ASR	and i'm always sleeping
71-1_1014.87_2.86.wav_ASR	generally i have gone without it
71-1_1018.68_1.81.wav_ASR	you know if you stay alive you're doing something
71-1_1020.89_3.12.wav_ASR	but you still hafta get up because you have a class or you've got stuff to do
71-1_1024.67_8.638.wav_ASR	and i try to make sure i always have at least eight or nine hours a week hours a day to be able to sleep
71-1_1033.308_3.68.wav_ASR	and that seems to be something that i didn't need to do before
71-1_1037.181_1.688.wav_ASR	and now i really do needta do it
71-1_1038.968_2.762.wav_ASR	but that's the time i do it
71-1_1042.028_0.872.wav_ASR	still working
71-1_1043.248_1.404.wav_ASR	but i'm not able to teach
71-1_1045.089_3.024.wav_ASR	you can see what i would be like in ninety minutes
71-1_1048.268_0.89.wav_ASR	it getting front of a clot
71-1_1049.328_0.769.wav_ASR	and i started talking
71-1_1050.288_0.602.wav_ASR	and people will be going
71-1_1051.388_0.52.wav_ASR	yes
71-1_1052.271_0.5.wav_ASR	yes
71-1_1054.451_1.998.wav_ASR	so maybe that'll come up
71-1_1056.791_0.58.wav_ASR	and i can do it
71-1_1058.051_3.74.wav_ASR	and i could teach through online and stuff
71-1_1062.471_2.149.wav_ASR	but so far i'm just doing other stuff
71-1_1064.971_1.119.wav_ASR	and i did love tigers
71-1_1067.49_1.36.wav_ASR	well see if i get back to it again
71-1_1069.371_0.419.wav_ASR	and i don't know
71-1_1070.87_1.35.wav_ASR	and anyway so that's what i do
71-1_1072.81_4.64.wav_ASR	and and i think doing it consistently is really really important
71-1_1077.79_2.66.wav_ASR	and i just keep pushing myself to do different things
71-1_1081.13_6.08.wav_ASR	there's literally nothing that i'm not forcing myself to
71-1_1087.51_0.909.wav_ASR	not forcing myself
71-1_1088.69_2.265.wav_ASR	the certain things i go through every single day
71-1_1091.81_2.36.wav_ASR	and i do yoga every night
71-1_1094.51_1.1.wav_ASR	and i think that's useful
71-1_1096.57_1.69.wav_ASR	and i i don't know
71-1_1098.26_19.94.wav_ASR	again i'm always looking at research always find something that's going to increase my healing in somewhere or another to the extent that my brain will be able to repair those language pathways since that was is disrupted
71-1_1119.04_7.42.wav_ASR	well i spent a fair amount of time trying to figure out why a right handed person with a stroke on the right side ended up with aphasia
71-1_1127.38_10.66.wav_ASR	but i mean other than the fact it doesn't qualify me for many clinical trials because they don't hire the left hand stroke
71-1_1138.248_3.801.wav_ASR	other than that i guess i just don't worry about it all that much
71-1_1142.228_13.0.wav_ASR	and just doing what i can to try to heal and rely on neuroplasticity to be able to take take hold
71-1_1155.48_9.755.wav_ASR	though i do understand at at my age in my sixties lastly is less likely as much as healing is
71-1_1165.72_1.66.wav_ASR	so i don't
71-1_1167.66_0.67.wav_ASR	we'll see what
71-1_1168.91_6.48.wav_ASR	well i just watched it every day this experiment in work or this work in progress and see her
71-1_1175.93_2.077.wav_ASR	how it comes out and how it doesn't come out
71-1_1178.67_1.08.wav_ASR	we'll see yeah
71-1_1179.91_1.98.wav_ASR	well a lot of people don't know i have aphasia
71-1_1182.17_12.68.wav_ASR	and i like keeping it that way because the there is a stigma attached attached to having a disability even if it's an invisible
71-1_1196.42_8.392.wav_ASR	four other people just think i missed spoke then then think that they hafta speak very carefully around me
71-1_1205.08_4.784.wav_ASR	so i i'd rather just see if i can just wing it
71-1_1210.7_3.66.wav_ASR	yeah very few people know that i have aphasia
71-1_1214.592_1.416.wav_ASR	well the firemen no
71-1_1216.008_3.437.wav_ASR	but i don't tell anyone else about it
71-1_1219.768_1.825.wav_ASR	it's just try to figure it out
71-1_1242.33_1.36.wav_ASR	and it should be something important
71-1_1246.83_4.6.wav_ASR	well you know i i guess i would
71-1_1251.764_12.94.wav_ASR	something that i would say is being very important for me was working with mnemonics elder who
71-1_1266.024_2.112.wav_ASR	very close to her
71-1_1268.136_3.957.wav_ASR	and i met firstnamea dear about ten years ago
71-1_1273.036_2.404.wav_ASR	and probably more fifteen years at this point
71-1_1276.336_2.78.wav_ASR	and i was teaching at a university
71-1_1279.476_1.38.wav_ASR	and i invited her to
71-1_1280.996_6.4.wav_ASR	was the advisor of the native students organization because my research is on state tribal relations
71-1_1287.93_7.06.wav_ASR	and i had invited her to come and speak in one of my classes
71-1_1295.79_0.926.wav_ASR	and she came down
71-1_1297.17_2.48.wav_ASR	and we hit it off with each other
71-1_1300.24_3.96.wav_ASR	and one of the most remarkable people that i've ever met
71-1_1304.73_5.19.wav_ASR	the oldest in a family of eleven
71-1_1310.55_3.42.wav_ASR	and she grew up on the muny residence without running water
71-1_1315.01_5.11.wav_ASR	the first person to get a college degree from her try
71-1_1321.04_3.68.wav_ASR	and she became the first female wheelchair
71-1_1325.92_7.08.wav_ASR	and in the last ten years we've gone on trips together
71-1_1333.92_3.12.wav_ASR	and i generally because as she's getting older she's under eighty
71-1_1337.32_0.87.wav_ASR	so she lets me do it
71-1_1339.05_7.74.wav_ASR	and we go to different events or different hearings which she's going to offer test
71-1_1347.67_7.05.wav_ASR	and what i've learned from hanging out with this woman who's adorable is the word i would use
71-1_1355.21_1.06.wav_ASR	yes
71-1_1356.984_2.503.wav_ASR	she doesn't see that well anymore
71-1_1359.704_1.4.wav_ASR	he has trouble reading anymore
71-1_1361.57_3.02.wav_ASR	but she has me right speech for her
71-1_1365.124_1.586.wav_ASR	and she gets up and presents them
71-1_1366.71_12.02.wav_ASR	and she refuses to to listen to the the response no
71-1_1379.45_3.74.wav_ASR	and she will find a way to power on through
71-1_1384.07_3.535.wav_ASR	and she gets things done that other people have not done
71-1_1387.89_9.96.wav_ASR	and why i see this is important is my own mother is very positive and very kind of mean and believes that you deserve to men
71-1_1398.43_12.315.wav_ASR	and hanging out with firstnamea i have learned a great deal about what it means to be a powerful woman not to worry about it people are pissed off when you say something
71-1_1411.09_1.635.wav_ASR	and just get up
71-1_1412.95_0.663.wav_ASR	you say your tricycle
71-1_1414.29_1.84.wav_ASR	and present your testimonial
71-1_1416.263_8.47.wav_ASR	and push every lever that you can easily to be able to get things through that you wanna get through
71-1_1424.733_14.14.wav_ASR	so working with firstnamea over the last couple of years we've been able to stop a mind from firstnamem which would have been signed on the bank of the muny river which would have been really just
71-1_1440.7_6.776.wav_ASR	so she has been my inspiration in terms of what i've learned from her
71-1_1447.78_1.68.wav_ASR	yeah that's the really fun
71-1_1449.92_2.26.wav_ASR	so that's that's the other thing
71-1_1452.86_0.96.wav_ASR	and so yeah
71-1_1454.02_6.652.wav_ASR	and she's been an on going source of importance for me i think to model myself after
71-1_1514.123_7.78.wav_ASR	well i mean it looks like begins with a boy who's playing with a soccer
71-1_1522.3_7.984.wav_ASR	and he's just on his own probably is something and he's really interested in doing
71-1_1530.81_8.77.wav_ASR	and he picked the ball maybe a little bit too power powerful than he wanted
71-1_1540.7_3.8.wav_ASR	and it broke into the window next door
71-1_1545.58_2.64.wav_ASR	and unfortunately he broke the window
71-1_1549.0_11.31.wav_ASR	and the ball came through the window right next door to the chair where his next door neighbor a man is sitting on his chair
71-1_1561.7_4.32.wav_ASR	so he's obviously really upset about this because he couldn't have been hurt
71-1_1566.34_1.16.wav_ASR	and the glasses broke
71-1_1568.22_1.04.wav_ASR	and it's in his garage
71-1_1569.74_1.088.wav_ASR	and it shouldn't happen
71-1_1571.64_7.02.wav_ASR	and so he grabs the chair looks out the window to find the camera who did this to him
71-1_1578.75_3.64.wav_ASR	now they're going to be some kind of
71-1_1582.51_3.18.wav_ASR	he's gonna need some kind of repairs that are made and apply
71-1_1585.938_20.64.wav_ASR	he looks like he's about ready to head over grab the boy and head over to the boy's parents to try to find out how the window would be paid for how he would get his apology and the promise that the neighbor boy would never do the same thing again would stay away from the window
71-1_1623.92_0.5.wav_ASR	okay
71-1_1624.855_4.46.wav_ASR	well it looks as if this little
71-1_1630.595_1.88.wav_ASR	let's say
71-1_1632.686_1.727.wav_ASR	hard actually it couldn't be kind of
71-1_1635.675_3.5.wav_ASR	can't decide if it's mail or female
71-1_1639.515_3.031.wav_ASR	and singing bai bai bai bai bai bai
71-1_1643.288_9.44.wav_ASR	they's getting ready to head out to the library somewhere some trip somewhere
71-1_1653.76_5.85.wav_ASR	and their mother looked outside and said
71-1_1660.248_1.642.wav_ASR	now i think we're gonna see some rain
71-1_1662.48_1.17.wav_ASR	you might need the umbrella
71-1_1664.82_1.11.wav_ASR	but this child said
71-1_1666.34_1.55.wav_ASR	and i don't need an umbrella
71-1_1668.44_1.2.wav_ASR	mean this is ridiculous
71-1_1669.94_0.6.wav_ASR	it's not gonna rain
71-1_1670.78_1.68.wav_ASR	and i don't really care about getting wet
71-1_1672.82_0.87.wav_ASR	you know i don't
71-1_1674.76_0.73.wav_ASR	and i'm not like firstnames
71-1_1675.74_1.68.wav_ASR	don't mail when the water hits
71-1_1678.28_1.97.wav_ASR	so this this children
71-1_1680.78_0.88.wav_ASR	and leaving anyway
71-1_1681.66_1.72.wav_ASR	it's gonna be fine
71-1_1683.529_1.775.wav_ASR	immediately began to rain
71-1_1686.38_1.31.wav_ASR	all of a sudden said
71-1_1688.02_4.78.wav_ASR	and i'm getting rags in my eyes
71-1_1693.33_1.4.wav_ASR	really wet
71-1_1695.36_1.22.wav_ASR	and this is not
71-1_1697.22_2.14.wav_ASR	didn't understand that it was getting in my eye
71-1_1700.24_4.96.wav_ASR	so i immediately hit it back because it was raining much harder than i thought it was
71-1_1706.08_0.654.wav_ASR	walked in
71-1_1706.84_0.896.wav_ASR	read to my mother
71-1_1708.14_1.485.wav_ASR	and i just looked at her
71-1_1710.54_2.22.wav_ASR	and she of course knew that i was right
71-1_1713.18_11.1.wav_ASR	the mother immediately understood that while it was very difficult for this child to ask for it or to acknowledge that they were wrong
71-1_1725.08_5.08.wav_ASR	they did make clear that they didn't need an umbrella if they were gonna be walking to the lake
71-1_1730.64_3.56.wav_ASR	so the mother then gave them the umbrella
71-1_1734.68_10.14.wav_ASR	and they went back on their way with an umbrella remembering at this point that maybe mother's actually know what they're talking about with the cinderella
71-1_1761.65_0.5.wav_ASR	yeah
71-1_1762.547_29.94.wav_ASR	well what happened is that the cat that belongs to the little girl ran up a tree and began to meow making very clear that it didn't want to get off the tree but no longer knew how to get back from the end of the branch that
71-1_1800.778_0.579.wav_ASR	help me
71-1_1802.158_0.382.wav_ASR	me
71-1_1802.54_6.1.wav_ASR	and the little girl is obviously just really emphasizing about the situation of her cat
71-1_1808.838_1.772.wav_ASR	and she's very worried about getting her cat out
71-1_1811.358_5.082.wav_ASR	so she began by going to her father and said
71-1_1816.78_4.1.wav_ASR	can you please help me get the cat out of the tree
71-1_1820.94_4.437.wav_ASR	and the fireman
71-1_1825.6_0.417.wav_ASR	horse
71-1_1826.1_18.22.wav_ASR	and he grabbed his ladder and put it against the tree and climbed up but could not get back up to the the limb where the cat was because those branches are too tall
71-1_1845.67_8.6.wav_ASR	he also inadvertently kicked off the ladder which then puts him back in a situation that he needs to be rescued
71-1_1855.03_5.868.wav_ASR	so at this point the dog is now barking because the dog wants the father to get out of the tree
71-1_1861.6_10.368.wav_ASR	the barking of the dog is making it more difficult for the cat to be able to inch its way back down to the trunk
71-1_1872.9_8.052.wav_ASR	so so the little girl is still really really stressing because her cat is his
71-1_1880.952_2.68.wav_ASR	that's a semantic paraphasic error
71-1_1883.772_0.899.wav_ASR	make that all the time
71-1_1885.192_3.057.wav_ASR	is really wants her cat to be able to get out
71-1_1888.249_17.88.wav_ASR	so they called the fire department to come down and not just rescue the cat but also rescue the father since he now needs also be rescued since his attempt at putting the ladder against the tree wasn't helpful
71-1_1906.179_13.419.wav_ASR	but it it does absolutely shows that the father was really trying to do whatever his daughter wanted him to do in terms of helping out the cat out of the tree
71-1_1939.75_0.39.wav_ASR	shut up
71-1_2104.158_2.744.wav_ASR	oh i'll keep the finance credit out of it
71-1_2107.478_3.16.wav_ASR	that'll be the next time around
71-1_2113.118_0.492.wav_ASR	it
71-1_2113.85_8.89.wav_ASR	firstnamec is she's the daughter of a woman
71-1_2123.66_2.76.wav_ASR	her mother has been killed
71-1_2127.23_2.66.wav_ASR	and so the two of them are
71-1_2131.04_13.9.wav_ASR	and the her father decides that it would be really helpful for his daughter if he remarried if he could provide a mother for his daughter cinderella
71-1_2146.02_1.74.wav_ASR	so he met this
71-1_2149.12_2.03.wav_ASR	and i don't know that we've ever heard her name
71-1_2151.74_3.0.wav_ASR	but anyway the other one is still
71-1_2155.58_6.48.wav_ASR	made very clear that she would be a wonderful mother to cinderella
71-1_2162.44_1.851.wav_ASR	and she also had two daughters of her own
71-1_2165.48_1.34.wav_ASR	oh they
71-1_2167.42_10.34.wav_ASR	and unfortunately the way that cinderella was treated was not appropriate
71-1_2178.36_5.417.wav_ASR	she was not treated the same way that the stepmother's daughters were treated
71-1_2183.777_4.48.wav_ASR	and instead she was used as a maid
71-1_2188.336_5.469.wav_ASR	and i have no idea where her father is in this whole picture and why he's not doing anything about this
71-1_2194.037_3.593.wav_ASR	but maybe he's traveling or he's gone or whatever
71-1_2197.83_17.72.wav_ASR	but he's left the management of his daughter to the stepmother who treats her very badly doesn't treat cinderella
71-1_2216.67_10.5.wav_ASR	so she effectively becomes the maid to these two stepsisters and to a stepmother
71-1_2228.39_5.92.wav_ASR	but she's she's a very very sweet young woman
71-1_2235.23_16.92.wav_ASR	and she found she's found away to also have happiness and establish relationships with the animals because that's one of her jobs as a maid is to make sure that the animals are fed
71-1_2252.39_1.84.wav_ASR	so she sings to him
71-1_2255.14_0.93.wav_ASR	they love her
71-1_2256.32_5.39.wav_ASR	and she's close to the the the horses the other animals
71-1_2262.1_9.26.wav_ASR	and she dreams about being in a better situation where she's loved and is treated with more respect than she is
71-1_2271.67_11.59.wav_ASR	well she's also quite beautiful which is certainly one of the reasons why the stepsisters are so mean to her because they are not anywhere near as attractive as she
71-1_2284.39_18.53.wav_ASR	but while this is going on in this household the king of the kingdom has made it clear to his son that it's time for him to marry because the king would like to retire
71-1_2303.08_7.52.wav_ASR	and he'd like to hand down the kingdom to his son
71-1_2311.32_1.88.wav_ASR	but first his son hasta marry
71-1_2313.84_2.509.wav_ASR	and he doesn't really want it
71-1_2316.62_1.587.wav_ASR	he's not interested in anyway
71-1_2318.34_1.38.wav_ASR	he's not dancing anymore
71-1_2320.22_3.01.wav_ASR	but the plan is that this is his dog
71-1_2324.16_3.094.wav_ASR	it was kind of like the prince harry of that time
71-1_2327.3_3.0.wav_ASR	the fireman and not the fireman
71-1_2331.06_5.74.wav_ASR	but in any case the plan is that there's gonna be a a giant ball a dance
71-1_2336.832_13.545.wav_ASR	and all of the eligible which i guess means of child bearing bearing years is supposta show up at this dance so he can pick the one that he wants
71-1_2350.732_4.303.wav_ASR	and again we'll not get into the finance critique of how this all worked
71-1_2356.58_2.034.wav_ASR	finally the word gets out
71-1_2359.36_6.948.wav_ASR	and the two stepsisters are just really excited about this idea because they're the right age
71-1_2366.94_9.235.wav_ASR	because their mother had married cinderella's father who makes a fair amount of money they can dress really well
71-1_2376.175_11.163.wav_ASR	well they can really get dressed up to go to this dance and see if they could be the one that would attract the the attention of the prince
71-1_2388.615_1.676.wav_ASR	senior wants to go
71-1_2390.815_3.322.wav_ASR	she also reads about this that that is coming in
71-1_2394.137_3.18.wav_ASR	and that she knows she's eligible because she's the right age
71-1_2397.537_6.18.wav_ASR	and i guess she's of that nationality or whatever period they're use
71-1_2404.5_6.33.wav_ASR	but her stepmother kind of makes clear that no she's she's not invited to go
71-1_2411.78_5.16.wav_ASR	well she's not gonna be able to go to stores and buy clothes the way that her mom would
71-1_2417.82_2.25.wav_ASR	so she tries to make something on her own
71-1_2420.4_3.38.wav_ASR	and she tries to take the materials and the rugs that are available to her
71-1_2424.24_4.62.wav_ASR	looks up how to make them in a walk
71-1_2429.36_1.08.wav_ASR	that was on page eleven
71-1_2430.56_1.38.wav_ASR	and i think that's what was going on
71-1_2432.61_1.33.wav_ASR	and she comes up with the dress
71-1_2434.24_1.5.wav_ASR	and of course she looks amazing
71-1_2436.71_9.244.wav_ASR	and i guess we're pretty and pink the film with a rainbow she got away with it
71-1_2446.2_1.78.wav_ASR	oh this is not
71-1_2449.65_1.12.wav_ASR	the cinderella
71-1_2450.992_2.458.wav_ASR	so her mother laughs at her and says
71-1_2453.57_1.49.wav_ASR	well not going out with those clothes
71-1_2455.45_2.61.wav_ASR	and her stepsisters mock her
71-1_2458.95_2.32.wav_ASR	and she's out in the barn by herself
71-1_2462.19_9.66.wav_ASR	and all the sudden this fairy godmother shows up based on one of her wishes
71-1_2472.03_2.42.wav_ASR	and i wish i could go to the ball
71-1_2475.65_12.128.wav_ASR	and she the reason that the fairy fairy godmother is showing up is because she knows that cinderella is a really sweet young girl
71-1_2488.53_2.041.wav_ASR	and she cares about everybody
71-1_2490.87_1.674.wav_ASR	and she does things for everybody else
71-1_2492.544_4.96.wav_ASR	and because of the beauty of her heart she deserves this dance
71-1_2498.584_2.36.wav_ASR	so she uses her magical powers
71-1_2502.18_6.324.wav_ASR	and she not only creates a dress for her that is incredibly ornate
71-1_2509.124_2.72.wav_ASR	you can go to the ashes with a
71-1_2511.9_14.753.wav_ASR	but she also transforms the mice into horses and the pumpkin into a carriage to be able to take her so that she can get there
71-1_2526.84_2.1.wav_ASR	and she can arrive in style
71-1_2529.78_4.64.wav_ASR	so cinderella is very very happy hugs her
71-1_2534.78_0.88.wav_ASR	and her grandmother said
71-1_2535.86_5.98.wav_ASR	remember this only will last this dream will only last until midnight
71-1_2542.26_4.463.wav_ASR	at midnight your dress will go back to your rag
71-1_2546.723_5.94.wav_ASR	your forces will be transferred back into
71-1_2554.163_6.318.wav_ASR	and the coach will be transferred back into a pumpkin
71-1_2561.13_0.573.wav_ASR	and she said
71-1_2561.943_0.442.wav_ASR	so i know
71-1_2562.423_0.792.wav_ASR	thank you very much
71-1_2563.463_3.157.wav_ASR	so she heads to the the
71-1_2567.38_17.24.wav_ASR	and of course because she is so elegantly arranged and shows up with this really regular type of carriage she's treated as royalty
71-1_2584.975_2.916.wav_ASR	the putman opens the door
71-1_2588.095_0.812.wav_ASR	help her
71-1_2589.635_0.812.wav_ASR	and she walks in there
71-1_2590.635_2.32.wav_ASR	and immediately the prince just like
71-1_2593.435_0.658.wav_ASR	it's like that
71-1_2594.515_2.3.wav_ASR	he's been struck by lightning
71-1_2597.575_1.165.wav_ASR	and she's the one i wanna be with
71-1_2598.975_1.165.wav_ASR	and he hands over to her
71-1_2600.475_2.06.wav_ASR	and there's an instant
71-1_2604.46_2.0.wav_ASR	he dances with her the entire night
71-1_2606.82_5.16.wav_ASR	he's pretty clear that maybe at this point marriage is the worst thing in the world if i get to be with this one
71-1_2613.19_4.0.wav_ASR	and he's and all of a sudden at this point she's pulling away
71-1_2617.56_0.34.wav_ASR	and she said
71-1_2618.12_0.46.wav_ASR	and i got a
71-1_2618.76_0.34.wav_ASR	excuse me
71-1_2619.22_1.32.wav_ASR	you know no stick around
71-1_2620.94_0.6.wav_ASR	you got food
71-1_2622.58_0.6.wav_ASR	and this girl
71-1_2624.18_1.12.wav_ASR	and she said
71-1_2625.6_0.71.wav_ASR	oh i gotta get back
71-1_2626.5_0.52.wav_ASR	we gotta go
71-1_2627.3_5.8.wav_ASR	and she runs away at about two or three minutes to midnight because she's
71-1_2633.26_1.166.wav_ASR	and i i've got this curafi
71-1_2634.56_0.786.wav_ASR	and i got to get away
71-1_2635.38_1.167.wav_ASR	and she races away
71-1_2637.7_2.81.wav_ASR	all of a sudden she's i mean she's a really fast
71-1_2640.94_0.44.wav_ASR	so she's all
71-1_2641.38_4.57.wav_ASR	way but all of a sudden he sees that one of her shoes has been left there
71-1_2646.16_0.98.wav_ASR	glass slipper
71-1_2647.86_2.174.wav_ASR	and so he picks that up
71-1_2650.2_3.24.wav_ASR	that's all he's got of her is this glass slipper
71-1_2654.1_2.56.wav_ASR	so he goes back to his father and says
71-1_2657.28_1.28.wav_ASR	maybe i'll marry somebody
71-1_2658.86_1.868.wav_ASR	there's only one woman i wanna marry
71-1_2660.728_1.516.wav_ASR	and she's the one i wanna marry
71-1_2662.968_4.68.wav_ASR	and all i have is this clue that her foot will fit into this shoe
71-1_2668.928_2.54.wav_ASR	it started advertising around the kingdom
71-1_2672.608_7.36.wav_ASR	one one whose feet will fit in to these slippers the prince will assume a condition
71-1_2680.85_7.16.wav_ASR	so oh my god all the stepsisters who you know they were ignored at the ball
71-1_2688.27_2.82.wav_ASR	but they're pretty sure they get their feet into this slipper
71-1_2692.05_1.6.wav_ASR	he one of the children
71-1_2694.54_19.21.wav_ASR	so he's and and of course at this point cinderella's back doing her work taking care of the animals cleaning in the kitchen once again just discarded and ignored and treated disrespectably by her family
71-1_2714.59_1.81.wav_ASR	so the prince starts riding around
71-1_2716.91_4.25.wav_ASR	and and it's this really bizarre sort of thing that he's driving around
71-1_2721.43_10.724.wav_ASR	people are running off taking off their shoes and seeing if their feet will fit into this slipper which is apparently designed specifically to fit this one single one
71-1_2733.67_1.9.wav_ASR	and he hands up and he stops at their house
71-1_2735.77_6.34.wav_ASR	he's really discouraged this point because he hasn't yet found a woman whose feet will fit into that slipper
71-1_2743.01_1.095.wav_ASR	he stops at this house
71-1_2744.37_2.793.wav_ASR	all of the stepsisters do everything they can
71-1_2747.29_3.08.wav_ASR	but their feet are just too big or too long or
71-1_2750.71_0.798.wav_ASR	it's not working
71-1_2751.632_3.22.wav_ASR	and then all the sudden
71-1_2755.261_2.278.wav_ASR	he's just about ready to leave
71-1_2757.592_1.74.wav_ASR	and all of a sudden he sees a woman
71-1_2760.172_5.59.wav_ASR	and he sees this other woman like the maid who's just in the corner
71-1_2766.572_0.428.wav_ASR	and he says
71-1_2767.252_0.588.wav_ASR	don't hurt
71-1_2768.83_1.36.wav_ASR	and the stepmother said
71-1_2770.312_0.798.wav_ASR	oh no she's not
71-1_2771.5_0.97.wav_ASR	and she's our maid
71-1_2773.43_1.84.wav_ASR	and she looks up
71-1_2775.92_5.43.wav_ASR	and he the prince just has this strange feeling about her and
71-1_2781.92_1.44.wav_ASR	well i like to have her come out
71-1_2783.78_7.311.wav_ASR	and i'd like to see if this if the slippers will fit her feet
71-1_2791.091_2.035.wav_ASR	and so she comes in
71-1_2793.371_0.92.wav_ASR	and she's a mac
71-1_2794.711_3.639.wav_ASR	you know she's been working in the kitchen and in the barn
71-1_2798.931_6.2.wav_ASR	and she's you know not not looking anywhere like the princess person that had been at the
71-1_2805.87_0.8.wav_ASR	but she came out
71-1_2806.831_0.759.wav_ASR	and she sat down
71-1_2808.51_3.56.wav_ASR	the prince put the slipper on her foot
71-1_2812.99_1.08.wav_ASR	and it fits
71-1_2814.73_0.98.wav_ASR	and then he looked at her
71-1_2815.71_22.48.wav_ASR	and what was remarkable is that he was able to look beyond all of the dignity of the will that she had shown the first time he met her to see that it was exactly the same statue that she had assumed
71-1_2839.43_15.337.wav_ASR	so they lived happily after until just like prince harry somehow the poppy did not like the cinderella because she was not of fine enough stature
71-1_2854.767_18.19.wav_ASR	and he hadta renounce his crown and go to another continent and then start righting mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete mete
71-1_2872.957_0.84.wav_ASR	alright
71-1_2874.864_1.272.wav_ASR	oh yes
71-1_2900.37_0.5.wav_ASR	okay
71-1_2905.61_1.0.wav_ASR	oh
71-1_2910.67_11.58.wav_ASR	an interesting really irritating thing about clocks to me recently is that i went to a physical check
71-1_2923.03_2.831.wav_ASR	and i'd just turned fifty five
71-1_2926.39_2.52.wav_ASR	so i had never experienced this before
71-1_2929.05_5.28.wav_ASR	and i thought it was my annual physical
71-1_2935.52_1.03.wav_ASR	and i walked around
71-1_2936.75_0.57.wav_ASR	and i sat down
71-1_2937.65_2.34.wav_ASR	and the nurse is checking my blood pressure
71-1_2940.41_4.62.wav_ASR	and she's checking you know the my heart rate my pulse and all the other stuff
71-1_2945.73_3.06.wav_ASR	and then she handed me a piece of paper and a pen and said
71-1_2948.98_1.34.wav_ASR	and i like you to draw a clock
71-1_2951.06_1.01.wav_ASR	and i said
71-1_2953.58_0.57.wav_ASR	and she said
71-1_2954.34_3.38.wav_ASR	because i i want to see what kind of picture you you can draw
71-1_2958.32_2.76.wav_ASR	so it seemed ridiculous
71-1_2961.62_1.027.wav_ASR	well i did it anyway
71-1_2963.0_0.93.wav_ASR	oh i just
71-1_2964.52_9.32.wav_ASR	and i knew how to handle what to draw a picture appropriately with a clock which is you first you put down the twelve
71-1_2974.0_0.89.wav_ASR	and then you put down the slipper
71-1_2975.14_0.66.wav_ASR	and you put the jelly
71-1_2975.98_0.71.wav_ASR	and they put the knife
71-1_2976.74_8.82.wav_ASR	and then you fold the numbers so that everything is located where it should be instead of you know having them too crowded
71-1_2986.12_3.09.wav_ASR	and then i hadta draw the pictures of two forty five
71-1_2990.32_1.08.wav_ASR	and i finished
71-1_2991.6_0.4.wav_ASR	and i said
71-1_2992.42_1.46.wav_ASR	oh is this what you want
71-1_2994.75_4.17.wav_ASR	or did you want to just look at what you have on the wall that's right there which is a coin
71-1_2999.82_0.95.wav_ASR	and she said
71-1_3001.11_2.02.wav_ASR	you have passed this test
71-1_3003.49_0.32.wav_ASR	and she says
71-1_3004.28_1.87.wav_ASR	who is essentially a demographic test
71-1_3006.254_13.939.wav_ASR	that when you are sixty five and you go in for a appointment for an annual check you will hafta draw a clock
71-1_3020.834_0.477.wav_ASR	and i said
71-1_3021.514_2.193.wav_ASR	one point will they stop doing this
71-1_3023.76_9.43.wav_ASR	because while i did indeed grow up with the you know the round sock right used it
71-1_3033.8_1.68.wav_ASR	everything i do is digital
71-1_3035.807_16.95.wav_ASR	so what happens at what generation will they decide that this is not the way to show that you do not have dementia or whatever and that you simply have a digital understanding of of what time is
71-1_3053.5_2.36.wav_ASR	so anyway if i do it i'm not gonna do it again
71-1_3056.16_6.11.wav_ASR	maybe i'll just mess with them and just put down some digital stuff and see what they do
71-1_3062.88_3.78.wav_ASR	and i have my ppi or something like firstnamew firstnamew
71-1_3066.9_2.818.wav_ASR	but anyway it's it's a test that they do
71-1_3069.718_3.888.wav_ASR	and i found it really irritating though i passed
71-1_3074.018_3.915.wav_ASR	it's it's gonna be upscale very very quickly
71-1_3078.438_1.048.wav_ASR	yes yes
71-1_3084.638_1.963.wav_ASR	oh let me see
71-1_3091.487_18.88.wav_ASR	one of the things i useta do when my daughter was younger is every january usually the first week of january we would head together to watch the email watch
71-1_3110.83_14.71.wav_ASR	and what the email watch is north of here on the wisconsin river there's one place that in germany the eagles are on the way somewhere else
71-1_3125.67_0.72.wav_ASR	and they're coming back
71-1_3126.63_1.247.wav_ASR	they're going south or something
71-1_3127.877_5.666.wav_ASR	but they all show up in this lake for about three or four days
71-1_3134.157_8.44.wav_ASR	and so what people do is they have groups the audubon society and other groups that show up with
71-1_3144.23_4.65.wav_ASR	and we watched the the birds the eagles because you can see them
71-1_3149.19_1.113.wav_ASR	you're really really close
71-1_3150.45_1.46.wav_ASR	you can see the
71-1_3152.49_1.454.wav_ASR	and you can see them with their mother
71-1_3154.33_2.28.wav_ASR	and and there's just so many of them at one time
71-1_3157.17_2.038.wav_ASR	in wisconsin we have a lot of hospitals
71-1_3159.43_4.8.wav_ASR	but we don't necessarily see ball the eggs as much
71-1_3164.36_1.23.wav_ASR	it's much more rare
71-1_3166.48_4.788.wav_ASR	that's something that we did for a number of years
71-1_3171.36_2.94.wav_ASR	even when she was thirteen and wasn't really talking to him anymore
71-1_3174.98_2.763.wav_ASR	we always had fun on that day
71-1_3177.96_0.725.wav_ASR	we would show them
71-1_3179.02_3.122.wav_ASR	the first she dressed really really warm because it's gonna be twenty below
71-1_3182.59_3.58.wav_ASR	we would go to the bank with firstnames
71-1_3186.63_2.08.wav_ASR	we would wait for the eagles to show up
71-1_3188.91_1.44.wav_ASR	we would watch them for a while
71-1_3190.65_2.38.wav_ASR	and then we would go have hot coffee
71-1_3193.31_2.86.wav_ASR	and she will talk to me during that time
71-1_3196.61_2.19.wav_ASR	when we were home then it was
71-1_3199.11_0.88.wav_ASR	oh god she's my
71-1_3200.21_0.568.wav_ASR	now time
71-1_3200.778_1.896.wav_ASR	don't talk to my friends
71-1_3202.738_13.726.wav_ASR	but there was always that one period even in those very very early teen years that my dog always talked to me after we watched the eggs
71-1_3216.464_5.16.wav_ASR	so that's one of the things that i would think of when i think of the word bird
71-1_3227.38_1.01.wav_ASR	what what was the word again
71-1_3230.244_2.56.wav_ASR	oh i don't know if you wanna hear that story
71-1_3233.039_0.485.wav_ASR	oh
71-1_3233.991_2.78.wav_ASR	well i okay
71-1_3236.777_13.094.wav_ASR	we can tell you a a recent one that will clearly not be rated or anything because really when you're getting that one it could be way more interesting
71-1_3250.021_10.775.wav_ASR	and i will talk about something i did last summer since my stroke i've been trying to push myself a little bit
71-1_3260.881_2.569.wav_ASR	and again i'm i'm much more tired than i useta be
71-1_3263.61_5.251.wav_ASR	but i'm still trying to push my boundaries to find out exactly what's possible
71-1_3268.93_1.28.wav_ASR	and how much can i do
71-1_3270.29_1.827.wav_ASR	and how long can i drive
71-1_3272.13_3.6.wav_ASR	and how many hours a day can i you know be active
71-1_3275.741_2.789.wav_ASR	and so i work with this non pro
71-1_3279.53_5.7.wav_ASR	and we were having a event in northern wisconsin off the hammock reservation
71-1_3285.397_2.48.wav_ASR	and it's a group is called waking
71-1_3289.337_1.68.wav_ASR	we do with firstnamee firstnamemi
71-1_3291.677_3.779.wav_ASR	so i i head up for this wellness advance
71-1_3295.737_1.06.wav_ASR	and i hadta get up
71-1_3296.957_5.26.wav_ASR	think i left town at five to get up there by eight
71-1_3302.331_5.519.wav_ASR	we had an event all day long and talking and you know different things going on
71-1_3307.891_1.32.wav_ASR	it was really really hot
71-1_3310.051_3.538.wav_ASR	and i was ready to drive home by five o'clock
71-1_3314.151_2.269.wav_ASR	and about an hour on the
71-1_3317.011_2.559.wav_ASR	it was about three and a half hour at three and a half hour
71-1_3319.71_2.98.wav_ASR	and i decided i can't drive anymore too
71-1_3323.47_1.68.wav_ASR	my head is just
71-1_3326.15_3.68.wav_ASR	and i needed to sleep really really quickly
71-1_3329.87_2.42.wav_ASR	and i've learned to listen to myself
71-1_3332.61_4.86.wav_ASR	my body says you're tired you pull over and you rest
71-1_3337.649_5.112.wav_ASR	you don't just like around around through drink some coffee and you know keep on going
71-1_3343.27_1.34.wav_ASR	so i pulled into this hotel
71-1_3345.85_1.66.wav_ASR	it i likely i found him
71-1_3347.849_3.041.wav_ASR	you know i didn't have a reservation or anything
71-1_3351.11_9.614.wav_ASR	and i was just looking for a place that had an opening so i could go in and get out of the sun and you know cover my eyes and not hafta drive anymore
71-1_3360.85_10.96.wav_ASR	but because i was as tired as i was and because i was pushed to my boundaries my aphasia had clearly blurred
71-1_3372.95_2.18.wav_ASR	so i walked in this hospital
71-1_3375.69_3.36.wav_ASR	and i mean clearly there were a lot ofvacations
71-1_3379.64_2.57.wav_ASR	well actually i didn't know that right away
71-1_3382.66_1.98.wav_ASR	but i thought it said baltimore
71-1_3385.14_0.809.wav_ASR	but i wasn't sure
71-1_3386.18_0.937.wav_ASR	and i walked in the door
71-1_3388.0_2.42.wav_ASR	and there's this woman behind the the dress
71-1_3390.82_0.48.wav_ASR	and i said
71-1_3391.54_2.24.wav_ASR	and i'm here for a room
71-1_3394.62_0.32.wav_ASR	and i said
71-1_3395.02_1.08.wav_ASR	do you have any vitamin
71-1_3397.62_5.68.wav_ASR	and and of course that's what happens with aphasia is you say word
71-1_3403.92_3.86.wav_ASR	and no fax machines could have been a response to covid
71-1_3408.16_3.161.wav_ASR	and people are wearing masks
71-1_3411.64_1.783.wav_ASR	and they're being very careful about that
71-1_3413.72_2.58.wav_ASR	but so of course i was trying to say
71-1_3416.34_1.56.wav_ASR	do you have a
71-1_3418.62_1.778.wav_ASR	you're right you know
71-1_3420.7_1.02.wav_ASR	you have a xenon
71-1_3422.16_3.26.wav_ASR	and they went into her covid program
71-1_3426.26_1.62.wav_ASR	yeah everybody here's been vaccinated
71-1_3428.38_0.711.wav_ASR	well all we're mac
71-1_3429.38_0.988.wav_ASR	wave everything down
71-1_3430.72_0.54.wav_ASR	and i'm just saying
71-1_3431.88_0.98.wav_ASR	so you have a room
71-1_3433.14_0.664.wav_ASR	and she said
71-1_3433.92_1.033.wav_ASR	yes yes yes yes
71-1_3435.16_0.545.wav_ASR	don't worry
71-1_3435.705_1.0.wav_ASR	we followed code
71-1_3436.845_0.623.wav_ASR	and don't worry about it
71-1_3437.565_1.797.wav_ASR	all you're not gonna get it here
71-1_3439.805_1.863.wav_ASR	and she gave me a umbrella
71-1_3441.825_6.66.wav_ASR	and i realize that was one way to cover things up is you just go with it you know
71-1_3448.76_1.911.wav_ASR	if she had a vase
71-1_3451.44_0.31.wav_ASR	and i said
71-1_3452.165_0.98.wav_ASR	you have a back
71-1_3453.98_1.77.wav_ASR	and so we just met with firstnameb
71-1_3456.24_2.03.wav_ASR	and then finally i went my way back to
71-1_3459.14_2.56.wav_ASR	you have an empty room that i can sleep in
71-1_3462.68_5.02.wav_ASR	so i got in the room went in and drank a lot of cold water and literally slept for twelve hours
71-1_3468.94_0.48.wav_ASR	yeah
71-1_3471.54_2.08.wav_ASR	so that's that's another story
71-1_3478.5_0.5.wav_ASR	and
71-1_3480.14_0.8.wav_ASR	the end
71-1_3481.62_20.94.wav_ASR	if i was going to choose something to talk about restaurants i would talk about how i paid my way through my undergrad which is through
71-1_3504.63_14.68.wav_ASR	and i waited beginning at at kind of a little coffee shop that was near where i lived because i had no car
71-1_3520.12_1.31.wav_ASR	and i could just bike there
71-1_3522.42_1.45.wav_ASR	and they were very very kind
71-1_3524.03_2.94.wav_ASR	and i did the breakfast
71-1_3528.1_14.32.wav_ASR	but i learned very quickly after about six months that you would get paid ten to fifteen percent as a tip based upon the prices of the restaurant
71-1_3543.14_8.24.wav_ASR	what made sense was to find the restaurant that was the most expensive in terms of prices and wore there
71-1_3552.167_3.873.wav_ASR	doing the exact same part of service
71-1_3556.39_19.218.wav_ASR	well if they're only paying five dollars for their meal and they're handing you fifty cents that's not gonna be nearly as good as if they spent twenty dollars for their meal and paid you two or four dollars for it
71-1_3575.98_5.36.wav_ASR	so what i learned to do is keep going to more and more and more expensive restaurants
71-1_3582.46_20.82.wav_ASR	the the maybe untold story is the wagers that work in the the gypsy spoon places are just as good if not better than the really happily
71-1_3604.84_2.74.wav_ASR	so that's what i ended up doing
71-1_3608.2_4.664.wav_ASR	and but again it what was so interesting to me is that i worked just as hard
71-1_3613.32_4.157.wav_ASR	and i use the same sort of you know
71-1_3618.84_5.61.wav_ASR	you hafta sort of keep a list of tasks that you're in the middle of doing
71-1_3624.45_1.994.wav_ASR	well whether you're going to the bar to get drink
71-1_3626.65_1.508.wav_ASR	are you going here to get your food
71-1_3628.39_1.405.wav_ASR	you're gonna go peanu more water
71-1_3630.11_0.946.wav_ASR	you're gonna give me your check
71-1_3631.51_5.578.wav_ASR	you hafta keep them all kind of revolving all at one time
71-1_3637.31_4.757.wav_ASR	trying to decide exactly how you're going to retire each of those taxes
71-1_3642.067_10.0.wav_ASR	it's really i mean being wafting being a waitress is a really mentally challenging job
71-1_3653.687_3.66.wav_ASR	it's just bizarre that they don't pay people any money to do that
71-1_3657.49_4.33.wav_ASR	but i was lucky because i made enough money that i was still able to graduate
71-1_3662.01_8.22.wav_ASR	and i wasn't paying the degree of the amount of money that grand students and undergrads are paying now which is out
71-1_3672.05_0.61.wav_ASR	what is it
71-1_3673.93_2.38.wav_ASR	oh yes it's for my underwear
71-1_3676.61_1.701.wav_ASR	the graduate school that was very different
71-1_3678.311_5.3.wav_ASR	but yeah i had no students because i worked as a waitress in restaurant
71-1_3698.06_0.59.wav_ASR	you know you
71-1_3699.03_2.999.wav_ASR	and it's it's really mentally kind of like
71-1_3703.14_1.235.wav_ASR	you know three minutes
71-1_3704.68_0.709.wav_ASR	and i can go get that
71-1_3705.62_0.591.wav_ASR	and i go to work
71-1_3706.54_0.366.wav_ASR	and i'm all
71-1_3707.62_2.536.wav_ASR	it's kind of a challenge
71-1_3710.2_0.816.wav_ASR	it's kind of fun
71-1_3713.34_0.455.wav_ASR	yes
71-1_3718.76_0.845.wav_ASR	and you can kind of see it
71-1_3719.76_0.59.wav_ASR	and they need water
71-1_3720.7_1.28.wav_ASR	and you need more coffee over there
71-1_3722.26_0.96.wav_ASR	and you got this going on
71-1_3723.52_4.32.wav_ASR	and i will say that the second place i worked i carried a tray
71-1_3728.62_8.414.wav_ASR	and when i went to get a physical they were trying to figure out why this muscle on this arm was stronger than this one
71-1_3738.16_0.74.wav_ASR	there's something going on
71-1_3739.09_0.75.wav_ASR	there's a girl
71-1_3739.97_0.49.wav_ASR	and i said
71-1_3740.68_1.82.wav_ASR	and i'm just really really strong
71-1_3743.1_1.92.wav_ASR	yes yes
71-1_3753.971_14.825.wav_ASR	well if i was going to make peanut butter and jelly sandwich i would begin by pulling out the bread
71-1_3769.311_2.802.wav_ASR	and taking out two slices of bread
71-1_3772.113_2.019.wav_ASR	and and laying them on the table
71-1_3774.633_8.24.wav_ASR	and then i would go and get the jar of jelly and the jar of peanut butter
71-1_3783.713_4.173.wav_ASR	and i would bring probably a spoon and a knife with me
71-1_3788.57_2.863.wav_ASR	and i would begin with the peanut butter peanut
71-1_3792.068_2.272.wav_ASR	it's really difficult work to say is it
71-1_3794.488_0.84.wav_ASR	peanut butter
71-1_3796.268_4.045.wav_ASR	and i would spread that on one side of the bread
71-1_3800.828_3.96.wav_ASR	the other piece of bread i would put on
71-1_3805.108_1.06.wav_ASR	we'd use a spoon
71-1_3806.568_1.011.wav_ASR	and i would pull out the jar
71-1_3807.92_4.373.wav_ASR	and i would spread that evenly on that piece of bread
71-1_3812.7_2.72.wav_ASR	then i would close the two of them together
71-1_3816.12_6.32.wav_ASR	and i would close screw the tops back on the jelly and the peanut butter
71-1_3822.66_0.63.wav_ASR	pick them away
71-1_3823.88_1.4.wav_ASR	and then i would eat my sandwich
71-1_3832.11_5.6.wav_ASR	well i don't do it often
71-1_3838.45_1.708.wav_ASR	well not
71-1_3840.85_15.069.wav_ASR	when i do my laundry specifically the fact i do have washing machine downstairs i tend to go to the laundry room because i can do all of it at one time
71-1_3856.37_2.654.wav_ASR	and i only wanna do it once a week or every other week
71-1_3859.024_4.476.wav_ASR	because it's just something i find kind of boring to do
71-1_3863.904_3.04.wav_ASR	what i do is
71-1_3868.044_1.74.wav_ASR	if i hafta do this tomorrow
71-1_3870.184_1.23.wav_ASR	so let me think about this
71-1_3871.644_3.54.wav_ASR	all of my dirty clothes
71-1_3875.33_5.584.wav_ASR	and i usually use the smell test to find out whether they go into the hamper or not
71-1_3880.914_18.7.wav_ASR	and when i decide that everything needs to be washed which also will include the towels the wash clothes and the other towels hand clocks that are hanging up in the kitchen i would all of them in
71-1_3900.01_5.52.wav_ASR	and i would use a container of laundry laundry
71-1_3907.24_0.66.wav_ASR	and i would put them
71-1_3908.31_4.39.wav_ASR	and i would carry it to the back side of my the back seat of my car
71-1_3913.6_8.52.wav_ASR	it would make sure i had quarters or had cash that i could use for the quarter machine in the laundry room
71-1_3923.11_1.57.wav_ASR	and i would go into the laundry room
71-1_3924.88_6.327.wav_ASR	the largest machine that was available that i could do all of my laundry at one time in one machine
71-1_3931.207_5.18.wav_ASR	and i would put the laundry in
71-1_3937.23_12.357.wav_ASR	if they didn't all fit i would make sure that the clothing that could be washed at a larger temperature would go into a separate smaller washing machine
71-1_3950.36_1.814.wav_ASR	make sure the soap was in
71-1_3952.46_2.068.wav_ASR	make sure i had enough car
71-1_3955.36_6.792.wav_ASR	and then i would probably go by food or something they're being washed
71-1_3962.36_0.924.wav_ASR	come back
71-1_3963.54_1.44.wav_ASR	the man in the tree
71-1_3965.86_2.403.wav_ASR	and i don't really fold them the way i'm supposed to
71-1_3968.54_0.71.wav_ASR	well i just couldn't walk
71-1_3969.66_4.29.wav_ASR	and then put them away kind of as i use them when i
71-1_3985.92_4.75.wav_ASR	you mean what would i choose to wear or
71-1_3995.3_0.57.wav_ASR	oh i said
71-1_3996.39_11.38.wav_ASR	well the first thing i would do every morning is start my coffee because that really is going to happen before i make decisions about what matches what
71-1_4008.33_2.38.wav_ASR	well i would start the
71-1_4011.9_2.75.wav_ASR	and i usually do the four over
71-1_4015.51_1.41.wav_ASR	and i really know
71-1_4017.61_2.19.wav_ASR	so i usually would grind the coffee
71-1_4020.33_1.78.wav_ASR	started the the water
71-1_4023.83_2.36.wav_ASR	and i would go into my bed
71-1_4026.63_3.12.wav_ASR	generally i have some idea what i'm gonna do
71-1_4030.63_3.28.wav_ASR	if only because i hafta dig stuff out sometimes
71-1_4033.91_1.26.wav_ASR	and i don't wanna have anything
71-1_4035.602_4.45.wav_ASR	well i don't really have time to look a lot in the morning
71-1_4040.49_2.54.wav_ASR	so i'm gonna have an idea of what i'm gonna wear already
71-1_4043.51_5.14.wav_ASR	so i usually start well clearly underq
71-1_4049.59_3.481.wav_ASR	and then whatever pants or skirt i'm wearing
71-1_4053.071_3.66.wav_ASR	and at that point it the water is usually ready
71-1_4057.231_2.079.wav_ASR	so yeah i got my lines clear
71-1_4059.631_10.319.wav_ASR	and i'm you know running around here half dressed and then figuring out what kind of shirt i'm gonna wear whether and then make decisions about how cold it is
71-1_4070.191_1.359.wav_ASR	so i needta where i hafta be somewhere
71-1_4071.75_1.32.wav_ASR	how do i needta wear a light one
71-1_4073.07_2.819.wav_ASR	and well the cops are being mad
71-1_4076.37_2.828.wav_ASR	but the time the cops made got on my basic clothes on
71-1_4079.87_6.666.wav_ASR	and then i take the coffee with me in the bathroom when i make decisions about ears and hair and all that stuff
71-1_4086.94_4.822.wav_ASR	but the bass is all establish the night before so i hafta worry about it
71-1_4091.79_5.715.wav_ASR	and if i absolutely am tired and don't know what i'm doing i just wear black because it matches everything
71-1_4098.11_1.432.wav_ASR	so i have a lot of blocks
71-1_4100.07_0.77.wav_ASR	oh there's the
71-2_14.77_15.16.wav_ASR	and i think my favorite part about where i live and i live on the near east side of madison about a mile away from the city is that i'm close to the lake
71-2_30.89_1.34.wav_ASR	well firstnamem is a city
71-2_32.41_2.38.wav_ASR	we we have four different lakes that are here
71-2_35.21_8.54.wav_ASR	and and the magician actually comes from a word from houston that actually specifically means for lay
71-2_44.69_5.4.wav_ASR	so a block away from where i live is late
71-2_50.725_3.302.wav_ASR	and it's the biggest of the lake
71-2_54.665_6.7.wav_ASR	and what i like the most about it is there's a bike path to my
71-2_62.83_6.42.wav_ASR	the lake is to my left with a running path that goes along it
71-2_70.27_7.38.wav_ASR	and i literally can get pretty much everywhere that i need to go in the city of madison without having to
71-2_79.43_1.82.wav_ASR	and i'm very close to the lane
71-2_82.17_4.02.wav_ASR	so one of the things i do when i run
71-2_86.95_2.98.wav_ASR	well though now i would pretty much call it fast walking
71-2_90.071_3.86.wav_ASR	and i'm not not not from my
71-2_94.531_6.34.wav_ASR	in my prime i would run about seven or eight miles a morning
71-2_100.931_2.26.wav_ASR	and i would get it down there about seven minutes
71-2_103.351_3.4.wav_ASR	now i'm pretty much just walking and
71-2_107.621_3.7.wav_ASR	and we're more like a seven minute mile
71-2_111.741_2.56.wav_ASR	but i usually get about five in every morning
71-2_114.621_7.309.wav_ASR	it's it's kind of meditative in the sense that you can look at the water
71-2_122.181_1.029.wav_ASR	you can see the bird
71-2_123.87_10.3.wav_ASR	it's just much more satisfying than it would be to be in a dress
71-2_134.77_3.32.wav_ASR	so it's one of the things i really like about where i live
71-2_139.91_1.36.wav_ASR	and bread
71-2_142.244_0.5.wav_ASR	oh
71-2_144.217_0.467.wav_ASR	oh
71-2_144.93_1.073.wav_ASR	and i don't think that i'm
71-2_146.764_2.154.wav_ASR	now sure that's the right word that i mean
71-2_149.284_0.5.wav_ASR	and i mean
71-2_153.748_0.593.wav_ASR	now what is it
71-2_155.384_1.306.wav_ASR	now i just see the word
71-2_156.884_0.526.wav_ASR	and i kept saying
71-2_157.764_1.566.wav_ASR	well i'm screwing that word up and stuff
71-2_159.584_0.92.wav_ASR	but no i wasn't
71-2_160.706_2.562.wav_ASR	five times i hear a word that i already know
71-2_163.426_0.544.wav_ASR	and i keep saying
71-2_164.206_1.044.wav_ASR	that i'm saying that wrong
71-2_165.746_4.624.wav_ASR	but i i just hafta be reunited with words that i actually already know
71-2_171.106_0.564.wav_ASR	oh yes
71-2_173.086_3.54.wav_ASR	well along the lake is much better than being on a treadmill
71-2_177.146_2.769.wav_ASR	and i don't the block away which is why like living here
71-2_179.915_0.5.wav_ASR	yeah
71-2_200.31_2.58.wav_ASR	again my speech is not reliable
71-2_204.23_8.987.wav_ASR	for the most part when i speak i know what i'm going to say
71-2_213.77_16.481.wav_ASR	but if i try to say something that's more complicated something in more detail or becomes more frustrated my words don't come out the way that i like to say them
71-2_230.251_8.589.wav_ASR	or the words are in my brain but i'm not quite able to articulate them the way that i wanna
71-2_238.97_3.38.wav_ASR	generally i know right away when i've made a statement
71-2_243.091_1.339.wav_ASR	but sometimes i don't
71-2_244.631_2.0.wav_ASR	yes today i i said to someone
71-2_246.696_3.48.wav_ASR	and well we've got this election coming up in january fourth
71-2_250.676_1.27.wav_ASR	and she said
71-2_253.536_0.404.wav_ASR	why first
71-2_253.94_0.621.wav_ASR	it's april
71-2_254.576_0.84.wav_ASR	and i said
71-2_255.492_0.747.wav_ASR	what did i say
71-2_256.376_0.528.wav_ASR	and she said
71-2_256.996_0.815.wav_ASR	you said firstnamej
71-2_258.98_1.021.wav_ASR	well it feels like firstnamej
71-2_260.696_3.525.wav_ASR	again i tried to just wing those and figure out a way to get past it
71-2_264.41_8.22.wav_ASR	but i simply cannot trust that what will come out of my mouth is what i'm actually trying to say
71-2_273.01_14.82.wav_ASR	and i don't know how to fix that except just to keep that trying to reestablish those language paths that have been disrupted and try to catch them faster i guess
71-2_295.73_2.62.wav_ASR	yes i remember exactly when i had a stroke
71-2_298.52_5.42.wav_ASR	we had a stroke on january first twenty twenty one
71-2_320.33_14.302.wav_ASR	so i essentially had a finger clack headache to my right temporal lobe and did not know what it was for two days
71-2_335.13_1.573.wav_ASR	and then of course they admitted me
71-2_336.703_9.4.wav_ASR	but it was passed the window of opportunity to be able to give me some type of drugs that might have broken up the clot
71-2_347.563_2.227.wav_ASR	so i entered the hospital
71-2_350.403_1.92.wav_ASR	and i assumed i would have another stroke
71-2_353.183_0.607.wav_ASR	and i have not
71-2_354.09_4.36.wav_ASR	and they have not been able to find the cause of the illness
71-2_359.72_1.67.wav_ASR	and i assume it was the perfect stroke
71-2_362.04_12.44.wav_ASR	and i assume it might have been a commission working out really hard being stressed because of the pandemic and not being able to have christmas
71-2_374.76_2.765.wav_ASR	those were prevacation day
71-2_378.52_3.0.wav_ASR	we were in a position then where it was pretty isolated
71-2_381.743_3.632.wav_ASR	and and i don't know what else it could have been
71-2_385.583_5.67.wav_ASR	literally there's there's physically nothing wrong with my body
71-2_391.703_3.994.wav_ASR	and all of my numbers indicate that i should not have a stroke
71-2_395.843_2.223.wav_ASR	and yes yes i had a stroke
71-2_398.363_1.62.wav_ASR	so yeah anyway
71-2_400.181_2.92.wav_ASR	peanut jelly peanut jelly
71-2_403.981_4.263.wav_ASR	which at some point i i just move on with that i guess
71-2_408.721_0.379.wav_ASR	yeah
71-2_418.32_17.68.wav_ASR	well as i said a week ago most of the recovery has been self initiated and has not been done to the direction of therapy or help from many medical professionals
71-2_437.57_8.66.wav_ASR	and i think that that's kind of a tragedy in the sense that people that have it
71-2_446.73_3.68.wav_ASR	it was characterized as having a mild scamic
71-2_451.57_12.92.wav_ASR	we are in the position or the particular to come to completely recover if we're given the right interventions and the right kinds of treatment within certain timeframes
71-2_464.99_16.04.wav_ASR	so i think the first six months after stroke is really crucial in terms of rapid recovery because you're building on the spontaneous recovery that you're brain is able to regenerate to bring back language
71-2_482.13_11.14.wav_ASR	really disappointed in the american health insurance industry since then i was not given what i should have gotten
71-2_493.53_18.08.wav_ASR	and so what i've done on my own is really increased my the quality of my diet which was already mediterranean Mediterranean style of of diet
71-2_511.89_1.417.wav_ASR	and i've already assumed that
71-2_513.307_1.654.wav_ASR	and i've been doing that for about ten years
71-2_515.327_10.103.wav_ASR	and i gave up drinking completely though i didn't really think that was an issue since i was drinking maybe one glass a month
71-2_525.43_10.02.wav_ASR	but it might increase no inflammation
71-2_536.21_4.1.wav_ASR	it might increase information in my body
71-2_540.325_10.3.wav_ASR	and that's something that i'm trying to work very strongly to make sure that i have an annual income
71-2_551.465_1.7.wav_ASR	and i've increased my exercise
71-2_553.585_1.6.wav_ASR	again i'm already
71-2_559.81_19.778.wav_ASR	so i've increased the cognitive the very conscious cognitive test that i do every single day to make sure that my focus and concentration levels are relatively high
71-2_579.588_2.895.wav_ASR	and i was an addict
71-2_582.748_15.385.wav_ASR	so i have always done a lot of reading every day doing a lot of work every day trying to develop and weave arguments together every single day
71-2_598.133_2.617.wav_ASR	and i've done it much more consciously than in the past
71-2_601.85_7.16.wav_ASR	writing is always reliable in the sense that i have the option of
71-2_609.473_2.297.wav_ASR	and i do sometimes use the wrong word
71-2_612.753_2.617.wav_ASR	and i you're just barely catch it when i at it
71-2_615.79_3.34.wav_ASR	and i always hadta eat it before the stroke too
71-2_619.37_9.39.wav_ASR	so i don't know to what extent those mistakes are connected to the stroke affects or whether that's just the way that i write
71-2_628.91_4.36.wav_ASR	you do a rough draft to get the ideas out
71-2_633.443_2.915.wav_ASR	and then you refine it the second time around
71-2_637.303_9.727.wav_ASR	so i i i think the only real difference from the way in which i lived my life after the stroke than before is making sure that i always get enough sleep
71-2_647.963_4.187.wav_ASR	before the stroke i tried to get sleeping
71-2_652.45_7.12.wav_ASR	but if i didn't i just poured on because i have a schedule that i hafta
71-2_660.87_8.901.wav_ASR	now it's it's a priority for me to the extent that i have available to me to make sure that i sleep as much as i can
71-2_670.05_5.06.wav_ASR	but other than i just have a reservation every single day that i've always done
71-2_676.49_0.563.wav_ASR	really well
71-2_677.41_1.165.wav_ASR	exercising every day
71-2_679.05_2.72.wav_ASR	push my brain as much as i can
71-2_682.23_7.28.wav_ASR	and i made attempt to take back up a language school
71-2_689.79_3.4.wav_ASR	and i was taking spanish classes before the stroke
71-2_693.397_2.653.wav_ASR	when i was in high school
71-2_696.33_3.6.wav_ASR	and i picked up a little bit of firstnamed when i lived in copinah
71-2_701.01_4.263.wav_ASR	but i thought spanish would be much more useful than french is
71-2_706.37_2.1.wav_ASR	so i started taking a spanish class
71-2_708.69_4.73.wav_ASR	and i hadta discontinue it because it was late at night
71-2_713.57_1.99.wav_ASR	it just wasn't working out for me
71-2_716.7_10.19.wav_ASR	but from what i read recently i think one of the things that might be really helpful to realize my english is to pick up spanish
71-2_727.56_1.88.wav_ASR	it's i you know i don't
71-2_729.6_1.14.wav_ASR	thought it might be confusing
71-2_731.12_2.971.wav_ASR	but not try it you know
71-2_734.091_1.949.wav_ASR	why not see what happens
71-2_736.54_3.066.wav_ASR	oh yeah that may be what i do next i think
71-2_739.76_1.333.wav_ASR	what i'm already doing
71-2_767.08_3.158.wav_ASR	let me see
71-2_771.54_4.68.wav_ASR	happy sad
71-2_779.25_0.7.wav_ASR	oh
71-2_782.83_5.9.wav_ASR	and i'm gonna talk about my reaction to what happened on nine eleven in two thousand and one
71-2_790.19_2.46.wav_ASR	and i was tired
71-2_793.11_3.98.wav_ASR	it was the beginning of a the spring semester in two thousand and one
71-2_797.09_4.16.wav_ASR	and and my daughter had gone to school
71-2_803.03_9.82.wav_ASR	so as soon as she left at at about eight fifteen i got on the computer because i hadta finish my syllabus
71-2_813.15_3.66.wav_ASR	yes i i i should have already finished my sandwich
71-2_817.67_1.9.wav_ASR	and it was generally done
71-2_819.73_2.089.wav_ASR	but i was kinda playing with some of the end of it
71-2_822.23_5.923.wav_ASR	of my electronic politics class because i just wanted to just upgraded a little bit
71-2_828.41_1.08.wav_ASR	so i wasn't on line
71-2_830.33_2.92.wav_ASR	obviously the radio wasn't on because i hadta concentrate
71-2_833.352_4.423.wav_ASR	or and i certainly wasn't much using television when i was trying to do my work
71-2_837.872_12.614.wav_ASR	so i was in this zone of silence with no connection to the outside whatever just going through these different articles and designing which one would fit best in terms of what i was trying to do
71-2_851.51_5.54.wav_ASR	and at two o'clock in the afternoon i was gonna take a break
71-2_857.21_3.32.wav_ASR	and i was gonna go to my gym and work out
71-2_861.07_1.14.wav_ASR	and it was a beautiful day
71-2_862.61_1.64.wav_ASR	it was you know september
71-2_868.85_0.8.wav_ASR	and i turned on the radio
71-2_870.87_3.98.wav_ASR	and the announcement said
71-2_875.69_2.16.wav_ASR	don't really know if the schools are gonna be
71-2_878.53_0.64.wav_ASR	and i kept saying
71-2_879.77_1.12.wav_ASR	the schools are gonna close
71-2_881.09_0.48.wav_ASR	what do you call it
71-2_888.143_3.145.wav_ASR	and and i got to the the jam
71-2_892.33_2.473.wav_ASR	and there were celebrations everywhere
71-2_895.423_2.206.wav_ASR	they were in the desk when you come in
71-2_897.723_1.36.wav_ASR	and that never is
71-2_899.443_1.827.wav_ASR	and everybody looked really really upset
71-2_901.963_1.96.wav_ASR	so i i'm walking in there saying
71-2_904.483_2.874.wav_ASR	everything happened here that i don't know about
71-2_907.37_1.5.wav_ASR	but everybody else knows about it
71-2_909.35_2.12.wav_ASR	they're all staring at the screen
71-2_911.55_3.34.wav_ASR	so i went to the section where my tread was
71-2_915.83_3.818.wav_ASR	and again the treadmills were not anywhere near us is running along the lake
71-2_919.77_3.262.wav_ASR	but that's what i was gonna do that day because i hadta do some lifting
71-2_923.27_1.915.wav_ASR	and that's what i saw
71-2_925.185_12.8.wav_ASR	at that point by two o'clock in the afternoon they were just replaying it over and over and over again about the two planes that were hitting the the twin towers in dc
71-2_938.265_2.813.wav_ASR	and they were investigating people who were trying to get away
71-2_941.365_1.64.wav_ASR	and everything is covered with ashes
71-2_944.49_6.22.wav_ASR	and i remember getting on the the treadmill and you know putting on my headphones and listening to it
71-2_951.07_7.56.wav_ASR	and i just kept going faster and faster and faster because the adrenaline of what had happened was just so shocked
71-2_959.41_3.86.wav_ASR	so i kinda use that you know to increase my work
71-2_963.53_2.82.wav_ASR	and i got out of there
71-2_966.61_1.02.wav_ASR	and i went home and said
71-2_967.91_0.384.wav_ASR	me and
71-2_968.294_4.966.wav_ASR	well i got a really close friend that lives in dc that works near the pentagon
71-2_973.35_2.086.wav_ASR	and so is he all
71-2_975.69_0.829.wav_ASR	what's going on
71-2_977.21_0.94.wav_ASR	so i tried to call
71-2_978.45_3.78.wav_ASR	and of course i couldn't get through because all the the signals were were dead
71-2_982.23_3.06.wav_ASR	now no one could get home and decide
71-2_985.57_1.836.wav_ASR	everything was shot down
71-2_988.71_2.16.wav_ASR	and i got on one
71-2_991.09_0.94.wav_ASR	and i start email
71-2_992.31_1.48.wav_ASR	and then i enrolled my department
71-2_993.97_1.78.wav_ASR	was in the public service department
71-2_995.93_0.34.wav_ASR	and i said
71-2_996.81_2.067.wav_ASR	we're gonna have a panel on campus
71-2_999.41_1.76.wav_ASR	we're gonna invite the community
71-2_1001.32_2.481.wav_ASR	and we're going to explain what is going on
71-2_1004.36_5.934.wav_ASR	and we're gonna explain all of it
71-2_1010.3_3.871.wav_ASR	we're gonna explain the the repairs of it
71-2_1014.18_3.5.wav_ASR	we're gonna talk about the history of
71-2_1018.48_2.588.wav_ASR	we're gonna explain exactly what is going on here
71-2_1021.068_3.442.wav_ASR	and everybody got back to me and maybe it
71-2_1024.788_2.32.wav_ASR	mean they everyone respected and said
71-2_1027.288_1.502.wav_ASR	and i'd be happy to talk about this
71-2_1029.048_5.302.wav_ASR	happy to talk about the sentences in a rock that are going on currently
71-2_1034.35_7.22.wav_ASR	and maybe that's related to what's going on with the the the bammers that are
71-2_1041.762_18.784.wav_ASR	all we know at that point that they were coming from the middle east and that they were attracting the united states and the pentagon and the world trade center as symbols of empire and the western culture i guess
71-2_1060.546_2.0.wav_ASR	and and how it is that were
71-2_1063.386_1.58.wav_ASR	they were emergencies with us
71-2_1066.026_2.694.wav_ASR	oh yeah it all came together really cool
71-2_1069.006_1.514.wav_ASR	we went to bed at one o'clock in the morning
71-2_1071.126_4.007.wav_ASR	finally got email back from my friend in firstnamed who was fine
71-2_1075.986_3.141.wav_ASR	and got up went to campus the next day
71-2_1079.127_3.12.wav_ASR	and all the the letters were just scrambled
71-2_1082.467_8.34.wav_ASR	and all we did is talk about what happened in every single class hour after hour after hour
71-2_1091.927_2.073.wav_ASR	alright that's that's a lot there
71-2_1094.327_0.6.wav_ASR	you
71-2_1095.507_3.195.wav_ASR	it was a great panel by the way
71-2_1098.702_2.177.wav_ASR	we had five hundred people
71-2_1101.002_4.48.wav_ASR	it standing long standing standing
71-2_1106.562_0.607.wav_ASR	my try to say
71-2_1107.262_1.0.wav_ASR	is standing
71-2_1108.642_3.021.wav_ASR	people hadta stand in the back
71-2_1111.942_1.56.wav_ASR	what what i'm trying to say is stand
71-2_1115.89_2.82.wav_ASR	and i've all these fears that i useta be able to say
71-2_1118.87_0.92.wav_ASR	and i start to say
71-2_1119.99_1.393.wav_ASR	and i forget with the eye in the middle
71-2_1122.11_1.8.wav_ASR	standing room alone
71-2_1124.33_0.389.wav_ASR	yeah we
71-2_1124.719_2.671.wav_ASR	folded up the place basically and once a question
71-2_1127.69_1.1.wav_ASR	and everybody's question
71-2_1129.59_0.76.wav_ASR	why did they hate us
71-2_1130.57_2.4.wav_ASR	and that's what we began with
71-2_1133.59_0.94.wav_ASR	uhhuh
71-2_1136.424_12.445.wav_ASR	other than i missed the whole thing because of course i was on line writing a letter that i never gave because you know circumstances took over where we were
71-2_1189.34_19.84.wav_ASR	well this seems to be taking place in a neighborhood which is relatively close to each other
71-2_1209.06_5.336.wav_ASR	and it looks like what's going on is a boy is in the backyard
71-2_1214.88_2.2.wav_ASR	and he's playing with his soccer
71-2_1217.52_1.92.wav_ASR	he's practicing his car
71-2_1220.38_11.126.wav_ASR	and unfortunately this time the ball doesn't the ball doesn't go where he hoped it would go and crashes into the window
71-2_1232.06_5.1.wav_ASR	and it looks like it might have been the window of his next door neighbor
71-2_1237.38_1.26.wav_ASR	it couldn't have been his father
71-2_1238.86_0.86.wav_ASR	it's difficult to know
71-2_1239.78_7.2.wav_ASR	but it was a window that was next to the yard in which he was playing with his soccer ball
71-2_1247.88_3.96.wav_ASR	well it hit the the glass of the window and broke it
71-2_1252.48_4.08.wav_ASR	and unfortunately there was a man that was sitting in the chair right next to the window
71-2_1257.78_7.66.wav_ASR	and the soccer ball not only broke the window but went through completely into the the house
71-2_1266.32_2.88.wav_ASR	oh apparently they have no screens from what i'm guessing
71-2_1269.48_2.687.wav_ASR	so it can't be wisconsin because we have mcdonald's here
71-2_1272.167_11.407.wav_ASR	and anyone the ball ended up in the house directly where the man was sitting
71-2_1284.62_3.27.wav_ASR	and he was not pleased about this
71-2_1288.15_5.76.wav_ASR	he stood up and looked out the window to try to figure out who had broken the window
71-2_1294.2_1.43.wav_ASR	well where did the ball come from
71-2_1295.93_9.0.wav_ASR	and who is the person who had redirected that ball to his window
71-2_1305.71_7.06.wav_ASR	he's it's clearly that there's going to be some kind of ramifications as a result of this
71-2_1313.51_3.88.wav_ASR	because if it's his son his son is going to be scolded
71-2_1317.638_12.22.wav_ASR	and if it's his neighbor he's gonna expect an apology and probably some sort of payment to repair the glass that's been broken
71-2_1331.61_2.368.wav_ASR	so firstnamed and the servant
71-2_1351.36_23.18.wav_ASR	well we're gonna type this story mother knows best which is a play on the fact that they're apparently was a much older visit show which was from the nineteen fifties or sixty
71-2_1374.637_1.24.wav_ASR	and he was very petite
71-2_1376.717_2.203.wav_ASR	you know the father leaves
71-2_1379.217_1.12.wav_ASR	mother is the housewife
71-2_1380.877_2.16.wav_ASR	father knows best
71-2_1383.339_19.92.wav_ASR	and in any case this particular story is gonna be mother knows better which is only significantly more contemporary in the sense that the mother's generally i would say as a general no better than their children
71-2_1403.327_4.073.wav_ASR	but in this particular case that's exactly what's happening
71-2_1407.4_17.237.wav_ASR	and and what's going on is this child and this child's mother is dating over whether this boy needs to take an umbrella with him when he leaves
71-2_1424.637_5.175.wav_ASR	and the mother is saying because she they're getting ready for the boy to go off on his own
71-2_1430.477_1.44.wav_ASR	and the mother is singing
71-2_1432.357_10.134.wav_ASR	from what we see with the clouds that are outside on the sky and what we see on the weather reports it looks like it's gonna rain
71-2_1442.577_1.295.wav_ASR	so i think you should take an umbrella
71-2_1443.872_2.02.wav_ASR	and the little boy is going like
71-2_1446.272_1.58.wav_ASR	him not taking an umbrella
71-2_1448.132_1.546.wav_ASR	one i don't need one
71-2_1450.032_1.204.wav_ASR	and i don't care if it rains
71-2_1451.572_0.969.wav_ASR	and i'm not gonna miss it
71-2_1453.572_2.904.wav_ASR	and i'm fine on my own
71-2_1457.132_0.708.wav_ASR	so she says
71-2_1458.152_1.904.wav_ASR	well alright you know best
71-2_1460.812_1.116.wav_ASR	and she says goodbye to him
71-2_1462.212_0.403.wav_ASR	it really is
71-2_1462.615_2.1.wav_ASR	if she's still holding the umbrella
71-2_1465.335_0.768.wav_ASR	he hands out
71-2_1466.655_2.06.wav_ASR	and it's not just a sprinkle
71-2_1468.935_3.82.wav_ASR	but it really really starts to rain really hard
71-2_1472.915_1.22.wav_ASR	it's a downpour
71-2_1475.7_2.625.wav_ASR	and he isn't happy
71-2_1478.655_2.945.wav_ASR	so the rain is getting inside
71-2_1481.94_2.26.wav_ASR	and he's getting really really really wet
71-2_1484.32_4.93.wav_ASR	his clothes are getting drenched and scattered with the water
71-2_1489.82_1.78.wav_ASR	so he gets about hampered
71-2_1492.22_1.78.wav_ASR	and you can't even say what's going on
71-2_1494.3_3.58.wav_ASR	so he heads back to his mother very
71-2_1499.24_0.76.wav_ASR	do looks at him
71-2_1501.22_2.46.wav_ASR	and she has the grace not to say
71-2_1503.88_0.744.wav_ASR	what told you so
71-2_1505.06_1.279.wav_ASR	because mother's no best
71-2_1506.48_1.32.wav_ASR	they knew that that worked
71-2_1508.74_1.78.wav_ASR	and he stands there and looks at her
71-2_1510.86_1.98.wav_ASR	and she handed him the umbrella
71-2_1513.76_0.96.wav_ASR	and he heads off again
71-2_1515.14_3.02.wav_ASR	and this time remembering in his brain
71-2_1519.26_3.04.wav_ASR	my mother's not always wrong about everything
71-2_1524.14_4.02.wav_ASR	and but of course he forgets it by the next week when something else comes up
71-2_1528.48_7.687.wav_ASR	where we are in this week he is now assured that his mother actually has a wish which he does not yet have
71-2_1536.5_2.081.wav_ASR	well right mother no child
71-2_1555.22_3.121.wav_ASR	well speaking of drama in the neighborhood
71-2_1559.54_8.9.wav_ASR	what had happened here began because the cat was sitting on the branch
71-2_1569.36_3.67.wav_ASR	and the cat has the right to sit sit on the the
71-2_1573.78_3.17.wav_ASR	but the next door neighbor has a dog
71-2_1576.95_6.958.wav_ASR	and the dog came out and immediately saw the cat and ran over and started barking at the cat
71-2_1584.11_1.22.wav_ASR	and the cat was stuck
71-2_1586.07_5.36.wav_ASR	so the cat ran from the the dog and up the tree because that was close
71-2_1591.15_6.0.wav_ASR	and that was away to get away from the dog because the dog couldn't climb
71-2_1597.65_2.042.wav_ASR	so the cat climbed up the tree
71-2_1600.41_0.894.wav_ASR	do the same young cat
71-2_1601.49_6.55.wav_ASR	so a cat that's just barely a kitten and isn't really a problem to being that high up
71-2_1608.43_1.61.wav_ASR	so the cat crawled up
71-2_1610.78_6.66.wav_ASR	the little girl ran out saw her cat was up in the tree and called her father and said
71-2_1619.16_1.18.wav_ASR	the cat is up in the tree
71-2_1621.04_3.96.wav_ASR	and she's out on the bar
71-2_1625.76_9.82.wav_ASR	and it doesn't look like she's finding her away to get back out because she's mowing you know very loudly and clearly wants to be rescued
71-2_1636.4_1.22.wav_ASR	so please help me
71-2_1638.16_2.86.wav_ASR	please help me get my cat out of the tree
71-2_1641.3_3.6.wav_ASR	well the father's trying to be civilized and the circle
71-2_1645.16_4.36.wav_ASR	so he immediately goes into the garage and finds his ladder
71-2_1650.2_21.487.wav_ASR	and the plan for him was he would simply be able to climb up the ladder get to the tree inch his way up to the limb where the cat was grab it probably put it inside his shirt crawl down and hand it to his daughter
71-2_1671.68_2.39.wav_ASR	and then he could be you know the helicopter
71-2_1674.76_5.62.wav_ASR	he couldn't fulfill his daughters' request
71-2_1681.42_2.26.wav_ASR	unfortunately he got up in the tree
71-2_1684.54_10.49.wav_ASR	and the he hadn't securely rested the ladder against the tree in the way he really needed
71-2_1695.33_1.1.wav_ASR	and it fell
71-2_1697.33_4.1.wav_ASR	so now we have two people that hafta be rescued from the tree
71-2_1701.65_7.1.wav_ASR	we have the cat that is still mooing loudly out in the far
71-2_1709.29_12.14.wav_ASR	and of course the father can't reach it because he's his wait is too heavy to be able to move into those limbs without breaking them down
71-2_1721.65_1.78.wav_ASR	and then he would fall down and get her
71-2_1724.19_6.76.wav_ASR	so at this point the mother who knows best has called the fire department and said
71-2_1731.81_2.587.wav_ASR	we've got a stepmother going on here
71-2_1734.59_1.211.wav_ASR	well that isn't what she said
71-2_1735.801_6.58.wav_ASR	but that's what she thought in her brain because she doesn't say words and everything your children because she doesn't want them to know about perfanu
71-2_1742.881_2.24.wav_ASR	can you please bring
71-2_1745.553_16.023.wav_ASR	unfortunately we now need help from firefighters to not only get the cat out of the tree but my husband who had climbed up to help rescue the cat
71-2_1761.576_6.523.wav_ASR	and my daughter is still shining because she's worried about the cat
71-2_1768.376_1.494.wav_ASR	and now she's waiting about dead
71-2_1770.876_2.274.wav_ASR	and the dog is still barking
71-2_1773.756_3.1.wav_ASR	is what she's doing is she's about ready
71-2_1777.576_1.228.wav_ASR	is the fire firefighters are here
71-2_1779.076_1.061.wav_ASR	and they're coming over
71-2_1780.05_2.35.wav_ASR	and they're going to help the man get down first
71-2_1782.71_3.09.wav_ASR	and then they're going to reach out and get the cat
71-2_1786.3_8.752.wav_ASR	and what the mother's gonna do she's gonna go and grab the dog and put him in the other room so that everybody will relax a bit
71-2_1796.11_3.213.wav_ASR	and everybody can make it out of the tree without getting hurt
71-2_1799.323_1.586.wav_ASR	the knife
71-2_2004.09_16.38.wav_ASR	and what we're essentially looking for here is economic mobility and social mobility and what the criteria is that women hafta possess in order to improve their situation in society
71-2_2021.77_1.86.wav_ASR	so we're gonna start with that
71-2_2023.99_13.24.wav_ASR	and this is an example of the very restrictive rules that were available to women in certain cultures and certain society
71-2_2038.46_5.74.wav_ASR	now what we're seeing here is a family which is relatively middle class
71-2_2045.26_10.16.wav_ASR	and the in both cases what we had were two families with children
71-2_2056.56_3.02.wav_ASR	and each of them had a spouse that died
71-2_2061.01_13.758.wav_ASR	the husband had one daughter who was living with him
71-2_2075.16_1.256.wav_ASR	but his wife had died
71-2_2076.416_3.656.wav_ASR	so he had a a young daughter who was about six years old
71-2_2080.296_11.24.wav_ASR	and again in europe society men could not raise their own children
71-2_2091.936_1.731.wav_ASR	they hadta have a woman
71-2_2093.856_0.741.wav_ASR	what was her rule
71-2_2094.68_3.78.wav_ASR	well people were relatively ridged in terms of what they were allowed to
71-2_2099.12_3.78.wav_ASR	so he hadta find a wife in order to care for his daughter
71-2_2103.96_13.22.wav_ASR	in another part of town relatively same social status we have a man and woman who had two children
71-2_2118.02_0.76.wav_ASR	and he dog
71-2_2119.64_8.66.wav_ASR	so the only way that she would be able to survive as a female is to find another man that would marry her
71-2_2129.4_2.86.wav_ASR	so they're both out looking for another
71-2_2133.36_1.3.wav_ASR	and they meet each other
71-2_2135.0_28.16.wav_ASR	and of course what the husband is looking for the widow's looking for is someone that will treat his daughter as a mother and you know we'll do all other things that women are supposed to do and that men don't do because we have very restricted social rules that they operate in this society
71-2_2164.74_1.14.wav_ASR	so they meet each other
71-2_2166.5_3.74.wav_ASR	and he's got the impression that she's gonna be a wonderful wife
71-2_2170.64_3.8.wav_ASR	and she certainly gusses all over his daughter
71-2_2175.66_1.62.wav_ASR	and so they they marry
71-2_2177.28_12.12.wav_ASR	there are now three children two daughters from her original family his daughter named cinderella from his family
71-2_2189.86_2.76.wav_ASR	and they've now blinded into this new society
71-2_2193.69_11.26.wav_ASR	the father then applies his rule which is go out and make money for the family and leaves the house under the management of the stepmother
71-2_2205.31_21.673.wav_ASR	the stepmother on the other hand has not fulfilled her promise to mother the stepdaughter but instead is going to favor her stepdaughter as if she's a maid
71-2_2227.87_6.94.wav_ASR	and for whatever reason the father does not interfere in what he sees when he is home
71-2_2235.41_10.02.wav_ASR	and so what we have is this this really terrible situation that exists for cinderella
71-2_2245.527_4.893.wav_ASR	and cinderella had a beautiful mother who loved her
71-2_2250.667_1.201.wav_ASR	it was close to her father
71-2_2252.027_0.76.wav_ASR	he lost her mind
71-2_2253.147_9.1.wav_ASR	now she's also in this situation where she's clearly treated differently than her stepdaughters stepdaughters
71-2_2262.887_2.555.wav_ASR	smantic paris france
71-2_2265.442_1.074.wav_ASR	it happens all the time
71-2_2267.022_0.954.wav_ASR	and anyway moving on
71-2_2269.122_1.278.wav_ASR	and they live in society
71-2_2270.462_8.32.wav_ASR	there's no way that women can improve their their position in this society except through marriage
71-2_2279.762_2.46.wav_ASR	is the only possible option to them
71-2_2282.222_18.073.wav_ASR	and so their primary goal growing up is to learn how to manage a house and also be attractive to the her her her social partners that are available to them
71-2_2300.295_2.36.wav_ASR	and i don't know what happens if they're not healers
71-2_2303.295_2.211.wav_ASR	and i guess they just fake it
71-2_2305.815_2.972.wav_ASR	in any case that's not part of this particular story
71-2_2309.455_1.22.wav_ASR	and she's straight
71-2_2310.915_3.032.wav_ASR	and so that's one complication she doesn't hafta deal with
71-2_2313.947_8.6.wav_ASR	and in any case on the other side of the city at a fire flash is
71-2_2323.465_20.82.wav_ASR	and again while the prince has essentially a lot of elegance power and social status he's also obligated to marry
71-2_2344.363_9.7.wav_ASR	because the plan is that he will marry a wife and that wife will then bear him children
71-2_2354.443_6.44.wav_ASR	and those children then means that there will be a limit that will continue on to the next generation
71-2_2361.383_1.861.wav_ASR	so he may not wanna get married
71-2_2363.24_6.92.wav_ASR	and we don't really know what his gender identity is or orientation
71-2_2370.56_2.72.wav_ASR	but he understands what his job is
71-2_2373.42_1.38.wav_ASR	he hasta find a woman
71-2_2375.14_1.42.wav_ASR	he hasta find a part
71-2_2377.46_11.7.wav_ASR	and his plan is to find someone who's relatively attractive while he fills the the organizations of his office in the restrictive social structure in which they exist
71-2_2389.76_4.76.wav_ASR	so the plan is he's gonna get this over with quickly
71-2_2394.609_4.6.wav_ASR	they're gonna have this huge dance this huge ball
71-2_2400.449_1.88.wav_ASR	and everyone in the kingdom
71-2_2403.749_2.623.wav_ASR	my i'm assuming we're pretty much middle class and above
71-2_2406.669_3.7.wav_ASR	he's not really going to the palace
71-2_2410.569_1.731.wav_ASR	it's not part of this at all
71-2_2413.36_14.64.wav_ASR	is inviting all of the eligible females who are not married who would like to be married to come an audition for him so that he can walk through and make his
71-2_2429.0_1.96.wav_ASR	and again this is clearly
71-2_2432.56_5.54.wav_ASR	it's almost like that bachelor show which i've never seen and never would see
71-2_2438.84_2.588.wav_ASR	but i certainly know where it is
71-2_2441.428_16.26.wav_ASR	that that woman is gonna be tested and graded and chosen out of a line of other available women to be able to be the one that he is deciding he's going to meet with
71-2_2458.96_11.18.wav_ASR	so anyway all three of these women the two stepsisters and cinderella all know that they are elderly
71-2_2470.64_6.62.wav_ASR	and they all start thinking about how wonderful their situation would be if they get married
71-2_2477.759_2.965.wav_ASR	and and again what's interesting is we're not talking about love
71-2_2480.919_2.54.wav_ASR	we're not talking about you know
71-2_2485.819_3.132.wav_ASR	we're not talking about people that are compatible with each other
71-2_2489.099_5.541.wav_ASR	we're talking about they will somehow be attractive enough for this mail to choose them
71-2_2495.14_6.668.wav_ASR	and then their life situation will improve because those are the only objects that are available to them
71-2_2502.2_11.34.wav_ASR	and it's a very restrictive society and a certain time in in culture which is very very limiting for female potential
71-2_2514.72_1.813.wav_ASR	so they're they're all getting ready
71-2_2516.76_1.25.wav_ASR	and they know what they hafta do
71-2_2518.04_0.98.wav_ASR	they hafta look at a tricycle
71-2_2519.46_1.52.wav_ASR	so they hafta have a really nice dress
71-2_2521.32_1.34.wav_ASR	and her hair is to be fixed up
71-2_2522.8_14.67.wav_ASR	and they hafta somehow make them stand out from the others in order to be chosen in this graduating heraldical contest that they're gonna be entered into
71-2_2538.05_7.3.wav_ASR	so because the stepmother favors her own daughters she pulls out whenever money they have
71-2_2545.61_13.82.wav_ASR	and she gets them the the fancy dresses that you could possibly choose and you know with hair dresser to get them hair done and they make up and everything else to get them as gussy up as possible
71-2_2560.48_2.99.wav_ASR	firstnamec pretty much knows that she's on her right
71-2_2563.97_8.22.wav_ASR	so she pulls out a book that she got from her mother which has patterns of dresses
71-2_2572.57_8.51.wav_ASR	and because she's smart and very creative and because she knows how to sew
71-2_2581.9_5.18.wav_ASR	so she pulls together some scraps of material that are available to her
71-2_2587.26_3.6.wav_ASR	and she puts together this really cool dress really
71-2_2591.12_1.64.wav_ASR	and i mean it's kinda off the shower
71-2_2593.16_3.109.wav_ASR	and you know it's kind of pink which kind of plays off her hair
71-2_2597.18_1.602.wav_ASR	and she's ready to go
71-2_2599.24_1.68.wav_ASR	and she's doing the best that she could
71-2_2600.92_1.16.wav_ASR	and that's what she is a baby
71-2_2602.7_0.86.wav_ASR	and she's ready
71-2_2603.98_2.02.wav_ASR	and of course her mother said
71-2_2606.3_1.06.wav_ASR	or no circus
71-2_2609.46_2.94.wav_ASR	you are not of our state
71-2_2612.88_1.4.wav_ASR	you are a princess
71-2_2615.14_2.22.wav_ASR	and you don't have the right clothes for it
71-2_2617.64_1.2.wav_ASR	you're dressed correctly
71-2_2619.54_0.74.wav_ASR	you aren't not gonna
71-2_2620.5_1.42.wav_ASR	my daughters are going
71-2_2622.98_4.02.wav_ASR	and they the stepsisters of course have gotten their cue from their mother
71-2_2627.22_1.94.wav_ASR	and they know to be really really cool to her
71-2_2629.38_1.02.wav_ASR	so they laugh at her
71-2_2631.4_4.92.wav_ASR	and she goes out in the barn to take care of the animals because that's kind of her refuge
71-2_2636.32_4.32.wav_ASR	that's the place where she can go and get some kind of effect from the other end
71-2_2641.04_0.764.wav_ASR	and she's out there
71-2_2642.1_1.3.wav_ASR	and you know she's
71-2_2644.4_2.137.wav_ASR	and she's wearing her dress and her
71-2_2647.06_1.593.wav_ASR	you know she doesn't know what she's gonna do
71-2_2648.78_0.6.wav_ASR	what is she
71-2_2649.62_7.806.wav_ASR	what can she possibly do to somehow get out of the miserable situation that she's in
71-2_2657.46_8.42.wav_ASR	and and this fairy godmother appears to her because she's you know a wonderful person
71-2_2666.1_1.27.wav_ASR	is giving to other people
71-2_2667.6_1.24.wav_ASR	and she deserves it
71-2_2669.7_4.22.wav_ASR	so this fairy godmother shows up and says
71-2_2674.82_0.58.wav_ASR	how are you calling
71-2_2675.52_0.52.wav_ASR	and what's wrong
71-2_2676.1_0.7.wav_ASR	what do you mean
71-2_2677.62_0.66.wav_ASR	and she said
71-2_2678.52_2.04.wav_ASR	and i would like to go to the the ball
71-2_2680.9_1.26.wav_ASR	but i want to wear
71-2_2682.56_1.04.wav_ASR	don't wanna be locked up
71-2_2683.76_3.48.wav_ASR	and i wanna have the appropriate clothes that i i
71-2_2687.6_1.84.wav_ASR	well to be dressed well like everyone
71-2_2689.8_7.06.wav_ASR	and i want to have the same opinions that my stepsisters have
71-2_2697.8_0.58.wav_ASR	so she said
71-2_2699.7_0.6.wav_ASR	wait a minute
71-2_2700.72_5.86.wav_ASR	and she you know uses her her magical abilities and spells
71-2_2707.42_0.56.wav_ASR	and she looks so
71-2_2708.52_7.98.wav_ASR	and she transfers the rats into horses that will be pulling a carriage
71-2_2716.86_3.12.wav_ASR	and the court carriage is transferred from a pumpkin
71-2_2721.2_4.98.wav_ASR	and she uses her wand and and goes over cinderella's castle
71-2_2726.24_11.79.wav_ASR	and all of a sudden she's wearing these inaugural date happily expensive beautiful dress

71-2_2808.012_1.558.wav_ASR	and please enjoy your moment
71-2_2810.63_3.14.wav_ASR	so she hugs the fairy godmother
71-2_2814.41_1.88.wav_ASR	and she gets in the car
71-2_2817.21_2.2.wav_ASR	he's taken to the
71-2_2820.33_0.36.wav_ASR	you guess
71-2_2821.17_8.52.wav_ASR	and even her stepsisters don't know who this woman is because she's dressed so magically that she stands out
71-2_2830.55_10.16.wav_ASR	all all the other people that are watching all they can think of she must be from a really really rich
71-2_2842.35_1.34.wav_ASR	and we don't know if her
71-2_2843.97_3.16.wav_ASR	from a very high social status
71-2_2847.65_1.71.wav_ASR	and she's clearly very beautiful
71-2_2849.56_5.5.wav_ASR	mean the fact that they don't even recognize their own stepsisters is pretty telling
71-2_2855.87_1.702.wav_ASR	and in any case she walks in
71-2_2858.34_8.7.wav_ASR	prince immediately in his apartment sees her and said
71-2_2867.361_0.856.wav_ASR	is to stand up
71-2_2868.82_1.51.wav_ASR	and she's the one
71-2_2870.72_1.77.wav_ASR	and he hits the window to work
71-2_2872.76_1.61.wav_ASR	and he immediately looks at her
71-2_2874.58_5.47.wav_ASR	we see that she's also beautiful on top of being clearly wealthy and well dressed
71-2_2880.91_1.45.wav_ASR	he's also great
71-2_2882.78_0.91.wav_ASR	and she's a wonderful dancer
71-2_2884.34_0.31.wav_ASR	you're gonna tell her
71-2_2885.36_1.74.wav_ASR	and there's an automatic
71-2_2887.88_2.89.wav_ASR	and there's there's chemistry between
71-2_2891.62_0.875.wav_ASR	and he said
71-2_2893.18_1.008.wav_ASR	he's thinking his mind
71-2_2894.42_1.321.wav_ASR	well i thought this was gonna be awful
71-2_2896.04_2.52.wav_ASR	and i thought this was gonna be a dirty dirty
71-2_2898.78_2.795.wav_ASR	but i really like her
71-2_2902.0_1.34.wav_ASR	and this is
71-2_2903.86_2.26.wav_ASR	he was hoping for something this match
71-2_2906.281_1.956.wav_ASR	well i was prepared for something else
71-2_2908.461_1.931.wav_ASR	work this just couldn't work
71-2_2910.761_2.955.wav_ASR	so he wants to spend time with her as much as he can
71-2_2913.941_0.479.wav_ASR	and i said
71-2_2914.681_0.98.wav_ASR	and she's into it too
71-2_2915.801_1.52.wav_ASR	mean they're they're really connected
71-2_2917.761_1.52.wav_ASR	it's just this wonderful bike
71-2_2920.001_4.289.wav_ASR	and then she looks up at the clock and sees that it's five minutes to midnight
71-2_2926.49_28.8.wav_ASR	and she knows because of this patricial class she sees what she really looks like how she's really not this wealthy princess but is just a lower middle class female in her kingdom who's wearing
71-2_2956.938_4.418.wav_ASR	he she knows that that illusion will also be gone
71-2_2961.538_9.22.wav_ASR	you she's pretty sure that what he really wanted is the the the trapping the animals all the stuff that goes along with him
71-2_2971.438_5.015.wav_ASR	so she knows this as soon as he sees who she really is it's gonna be over
71-2_2976.453_4.78.wav_ASR	so she raises away as quickly as she can because she wants to get away she
71-2_2981.093_8.34.wav_ASR	he doesn't wanna see the look in his eye when he sees who she really is and what her real status is and how she's really dressed
71-2_2990.23_2.14.wav_ASR	so he's he doesn't understand what happened
71-2_2992.653_0.437.wav_ASR	here's she goes
71-2_2993.173_0.717.wav_ASR	and what did he say
71-2_2994.053_1.277.wav_ASR	did you say something to her
71-2_2995.46_1.51.wav_ASR	and where she happened
71-2_2997.36_6.02.wav_ASR	and she raises away as quickly as she can so quickly that she trips on her shoe
71-2_3003.6_0.62.wav_ASR	and she tried
71-2_3004.74_1.712.wav_ASR	and her shoe falls off
71-2_3006.6_1.342.wav_ASR	he doesn't have time to grab it
71-2_3008.32_0.93.wav_ASR	and she's gotta get going
71-2_3009.56_0.89.wav_ASR	and she's gonna get away
71-2_3010.96_1.49.wav_ASR	so she makes it around the corner
71-2_3012.45_3.64.wav_ASR	and immediately it happens
71-2_3016.65_9.027.wav_ASR	the the ball dress is transferred back into her rags
71-2_3025.677_7.746.wav_ASR	the pumpkin luckily she didn't get in it because i don't know what would happen if she was actually inside the pumpkin
71-2_3033.917_1.461.wav_ASR	it's gone
71-2_3035.637_0.493.wav_ASR	it's a pumpkin
71-2_3036.697_2.343.wav_ASR	and the the horses are gone
71-2_3039.7_1.22.wav_ASR	they're rats again
71-2_3041.9_5.82.wav_ASR	so she walks home sneaks in the back because you know they don't really care what she's doing
71-2_3047.96_2.44.wav_ASR	and she could be out in the barn or whatever
71-2_3051.18_1.98.wav_ASR	and she remembers her mom
71-2_3053.64_0.44.wav_ASR	who saw it
71-2_3054.52_2.96.wav_ASR	okay i got to see what it was like to be on the other side of it
71-2_3058.28_1.562.wav_ASR	oh maybe i can be content
71-2_3059.842_2.694.wav_ASR	or maybe there's some other way that i can get out of here
71-2_3062.542_1.178.wav_ASR	at least i had
71-2_3064.362_9.62.wav_ASR	least i know that if i had the appropriate clothes i could walk into a society at that level and i could say
71-2_3075.322_2.431.wav_ASR	meantime he's back in the palace
71-2_3078.142_1.402.wav_ASR	he's chasing after her
71-2_3079.8_11.914.wav_ASR	it's you know kind of what's going on in his brain is got all these women are throwing themselves at him but all of this woman is playing hard to get because she left
71-2_3092.42_1.26.wav_ASR	so there's kind of a mystery there
71-2_3093.8_0.92.wav_ASR	and he stopped the shoe
71-2_3095.48_0.44.wav_ASR	and he says
71-2_3096.62_2.419.wav_ASR	and i want that woman
71-2_3099.039_1.554.wav_ASR	and he says that to his father
71-2_3101.459_0.874.wav_ASR	and i will get married
71-2_3102.659_1.457.wav_ASR	well do everything you want me to do
71-2_3104.319_1.26.wav_ASR	oh fulfill my obligation
71-2_3106.019_2.317.wav_ASR	but i'm only gonna marry a woman i wanna be with
71-2_3108.479_1.188.wav_ASR	and i've decided who it is
71-2_3109.899_0.481.wav_ASR	it's her
71-2_3110.579_0.492.wav_ASR	the prince
71-2_3111.559_1.82.wav_ASR	the mystery woman
71-2_3113.739_1.359.wav_ASR	and i've got her shoe
71-2_3115.098_9.104.wav_ASR	so all i hafta do now is go around and see if i can figure out whose foot who's foot will fit into that shoe
71-2_3124.478_2.226.wav_ASR	and then that will be the person
71-2_3126.704_14.559.wav_ASR	and because he's beginning to understand in his mind that there are some limitations of this society which is that there are human beings that transcend their social status and how much money they make
71-2_3141.263_17.44.wav_ASR	and he's beginning to think if the their souls could just be soulmates that that would be something that it could exist generally of what their initial position in society was
71-2_3158.75_4.86.wav_ASR	so he's thinking at this point he's thinking much more broadly than his father is
71-2_3163.91_2.82.wav_ASR	and so they've got this this this bird
71-2_3167.87_7.62.wav_ASR	if he can find a woman whose feet fit into those glass slippers he'll know who that person is
71-2_3175.61_0.918.wav_ASR	and then help look at her
71-2_3176.528_4.36.wav_ASR	and he'll be able to know that that person that his his true
71-2_3181.928_1.599.wav_ASR	and that's the person that he will go with
71-2_3184.23_8.169.wav_ASR	and because the way society works is if you're rich you can marry down but if you're but it hasta be their choice
71-2_3192.59_7.512.wav_ASR	if you're poor and you wanna marry up you're gonna be vued as some kind of social climbers
71-2_3200.21_5.812.wav_ASR	so you pretty much need someone rich to reach down in some way
71-2_3207.09_0.38.wav_ASR	so
71-2_3208.27_0.924.wav_ASR	he's married
71-2_3209.37_0.56.wav_ASR	and she's playing
71-2_3210.23_5.02.wav_ASR	and given the psychiatric limits of them she doesn't get to ask him
71-2_3215.67_1.58.wav_ASR	he hasta ask her
71-2_3217.53_2.64.wav_ASR	and this goes back two hundred years
71-2_3220.23_10.62.wav_ASR	and this is the way in which europe organized their society to their citizens in terms of what people could actually do
71-2_3232.95_1.66.wav_ASR	so he's going around
71-2_3234.63_9.058.wav_ASR	and of course this is clearly a really ineffective way to find the partner that he's actually looking for the mystery woman who got away
71-2_3244.37_1.53.wav_ASR	but he's no else what to do
71-2_3246.27_1.395.wav_ASR	and i mean you said adverse
71-2_3248.05_0.952.wav_ASR	just the one i want
71-2_3249.19_4.215.wav_ASR	who saw the woman you know with the great carriage
71-2_3253.405_1.7.wav_ASR	fireman is called the firetruck
71-2_3255.445_1.264.wav_ASR	everybody's looking for her
71-2_3256.825_0.684.wav_ASR	they can't find me
71-2_3258.025_3.705.wav_ASR	so we're gonna start with the the shoe because he's got something in front of him
71-2_3262.625_10.345.wav_ASR	and they advance that he will be going city to city seeing if woman would come forward to see if he can find the woman that will fit the shoe
71-2_3273.59_2.54.wav_ASR	so of course the stepdaughters
71-2_3276.77_4.492.wav_ASR	he passed us by the night of the ball
71-2_3281.67_5.34.wav_ASR	but all we gotta do at this point is get our feet to fit into that shoe
71-2_3287.15_7.66.wav_ASR	and of course they're looking at this in a really superficial kind of way because he knows that as soon as he finds the right woman
71-2_3298.01_6.16.wav_ASR	and clearly even if those shoes did fit the stepdaughters it wouldn't match
71-2_3304.47_1.08.wav_ASR	they're be no
71-2_3305.92_1.24.wav_ASR	they're be no camels
71-2_3307.5_1.43.wav_ASR	but you know they don't understand that
71-2_3309.14_4.5.wav_ASR	they're really behind in terms of understanding human relationships
71-2_3314.91_9.46.wav_ASR	firstnamec is she knows if she has the opportunity to connect with him again he can take her out of the situation that she's in
71-2_3324.63_1.94.wav_ASR	and they did connect
71-2_3326.99_0.66.wav_ASR	they shouldn't know
71-2_3327.87_0.666.wav_ASR	what they did
71-2_3328.77_1.6.wav_ASR	it was very important
71-2_3331.15_16.88.wav_ASR	but for whatever reason because of the fairy godmother she's she's been given that opportunity to step out of her room and move into a the princess's palace
71-2_3349.85_4.94.wav_ASR	so when they come up to the house both of the stepdaughters go
71-2_3355.33_3.9.wav_ASR	may try very hard to see if their feet will fit into the shoe
71-2_3359.65_1.118.wav_ASR	and they they don't
71-2_3361.07_2.251.wav_ASR	or doing everything that he can
71-2_3363.39_2.46.wav_ASR	and this point the prince is just very
71-2_3366.67_1.663.wav_ASR	doesn't think he's ever gonna find her again
71-2_3368.45_4.78.wav_ASR	and he'll be stuck with somebody else that his father will probably arrange for him
71-2_3374.21_1.02.wav_ASR	and he finally said
71-2_3375.45_9.07.wav_ASR	there are any other women in this house who could possibly be eligible for this
71-2_3385.34_2.26.wav_ASR	and cinderella steps forth
71-2_3388.1_5.46.wav_ASR	and this is the bravest thing she's ever done because her stepmother is just gonna punish her for this after
71-2_3394.22_0.66.wav_ASR	and she said
71-2_3395.354_0.61.wav_ASR	and i'm here
71-2_3396.64_1.68.wav_ASR	and the stepmother turns and looks at
71-2_3398.32_11.3.wav_ASR	and she's ready to you know clearly to punish her and and bash her out to the barn prevent her not to eat for a while and really really make her life miserable
71-2_3410.66_4.26.wav_ASR	but the person that's working with the prince said
71-2_3415.8_1.04.wav_ASR	and he said everybody
71-2_3417.006_1.52.wav_ASR	well come on now
71-2_3419.206_5.75.wav_ASR	and she steps forward describe the fact that she's being glare at by the family members
71-2_3426.49_1.26.wav_ASR	and she sits down
71-2_3428.266_4.56.wav_ASR	and her foot fits the shoe
71-2_3433.786_1.224.wav_ASR	the prince looks at her
71-2_3435.486_0.884.wav_ASR	they're eyes me
71-2_3437.19_5.92.wav_ASR	and once again he knows he's met his
71-2_3444.51_11.84.wav_ASR	and at that point all of the power that the prince has to be able to protect her from her stepmother is kind of and for
71-2_3457.31_6.494.wav_ASR	all of her beautiful clothes come back though we're beginning to think this might have been an illusion in the first place
71-2_3465.03_1.22.wav_ASR	the stepmother said
71-2_3467.17_0.966.wav_ASR	he's out of my hands
71-2_3468.27_3.048.wav_ASR	and i had no ability to punish her anymore
71-2_3471.91_15.74.wav_ASR	and the prince calls her out of there and brings her back to the palace where she will be groomed to be a much higher status than she has been living
71-2_3488.11_2.18.wav_ASR	and she's gonna hafta learn how to marry
71-2_3490.38_2.51.wav_ASR	or she's gonna have learned how to talk better
71-2_3493.22_6.463.wav_ASR	and she's gonna hafta learn how to correct herself as a lady
71-2_3500.06_5.22.wav_ASR	all the things that are associated associated with a higher social class
71-2_3505.28_7.11.wav_ASR	but because they connect at a human level this is gonna work
71-2_3569.68_4.16.wav_ASR	it was just thinking about telling you about the one i told you last
71-2_3574.16_1.744.wav_ASR	so i hafta come up with the new one and that
71-2_3575.904_16.746.wav_ASR	when i was in the third grade which means i was about eight i was very good with being able to read a class
71-2_3594.17_4.66.wav_ASR	but there were some details that i was not completely clear about
71-2_3599.49_5.1.wav_ASR	and one of those is what is a quarter after on a clock
71-2_3606.01_7.8.wav_ASR	and i mean i certainly knew that the shorter hand or hand was the hour
71-2_3614.27_3.18.wav_ASR	and the long handle was the minivan
71-2_3618.41_10.9.wav_ASR	but from my positive from my in my eight annual brain when someone said twenty five after or a quarter after it meant twenty
71-2_3629.95_0.94.wav_ASR	didn't mean fifteen
71-2_3632.237_7.116.wav_ASR	and what had happened is my older sister was had stayed home sick that day
71-2_3640.43_4.54.wav_ASR	and i was sposta go to her elementary school teacher
71-2_3645.277_2.053.wav_ASR	and she was in the fifth grade
71-2_3647.95_6.86.wav_ASR	and i was supposed to get her home homework and bring it home to her so that she could do a work and she could return in the next day
71-2_3655.69_1.8.wav_ASR	and so i went to my teacher and said
71-2_3657.81_4.4.wav_ASR	and i'm supposed to go to missus firstnamesk
71-2_3662.55_3.64.wav_ASR	and i'm supposed to pick up my sister's home
71-2_3667.09_0.66.wav_ASR	and she said
71-2_3668.13_1.372.wav_ASR	why don't you go at courtier after
71-2_3669.502_1.648.wav_ASR	so i said
71-2_3671.37_0.632.wav_ASR	okay i will
71-2_3672.79_7.687.wav_ASR	my thought quarter after was twenty five minutes after because in my mind that's what made sense
71-2_3680.63_1.36.wav_ASR	the court is twenty five minutes
71-2_3682.55_2.16.wav_ASR	four a quarter is worth twenty five cents
71-2_3685.29_6.464.wav_ASR	so quarter after would be three twenty five not three fifteen which is what she's saying
71-2_3691.83_1.241.wav_ASR	fourth after the hour
71-2_3693.83_6.8.wav_ASR	so i waited til three twenty five which is five minutes before the school is closed
71-2_3701.57_3.218.wav_ASR	it's way too late for me to be going and doing what i'm supposed to be doing
71-2_3704.71_1.76.wav_ASR	and i was sposta be done at ten minutes early
71-2_3706.77_5.92.wav_ASR	and i'm watching the clock exactly three twenty five and getting up and going to doing what i'm supposed to do
71-2_3713.17_1.54.wav_ASR	and i ran home
71-2_3715.13_4.3.wav_ASR	and of course it's a mess because i'm missing the end of my class
71-2_3720.41_4.7.wav_ASR	her class missus first's class is closing down
71-2_3726.15_4.02.wav_ASR	and so i get back to my class probably at three thirty five
71-2_3730.99_3.236.wav_ASR	my teacher is still waiting there because my stuff is still in the desk
71-2_3734.91_1.24.wav_ASR	did you wait so long
71-2_3736.33_0.6.wav_ASR	and she said
71-2_3737.07_2.17.wav_ASR	and i went exactly when you told me to go
71-2_3739.78_1.66.wav_ASR	you told me to go in korea
71-2_3742.38_0.58.wav_ASR	and she said
71-2_3743.24_2.52.wav_ASR	oh no you didn't go til three twenty five
71-2_3746.02_0.42.wav_ASR	and i said
71-2_3746.78_1.46.wav_ASR	but isn't that correct
71-2_3749.18_19.93.wav_ASR	and so at the age of eight i understood finally that when adults say court after they're judging or referring to a clock that they mean fifteen minutes after an hour and not twenty five minutes after
71-2_3769.95_0.381.wav_ASR	how's it
71-2_3770.47_0.576.wav_ASR	that's i don't know
71-2_3783.83_0.927.wav_ASR	well what to me
71-2_3784.77_0.667.wav_ASR	and i was age
71-2_3785.65_0.876.wav_ASR	it still makes sense
71-2_3786.87_2.118.wav_ASR	you said you know a quarter after the hour
71-2_3788.988_1.9.wav_ASR	carotid artery goes to the brain
71-2_3791.248_1.687.wav_ASR	they just weren't clear about it
71-2_3793.668_2.282.wav_ASR	now that i actually talked back to
71-2_3796.328_1.262.wav_ASR	me and i was in a hospital
71-2_3797.748_1.362.wav_ASR	you're never talked back to anybody
71-2_3799.368_1.8.wav_ASR	but i was just really confused
71-2_3809.35_6.62.wav_ASR	you think of a good bread
71-2_3816.149_18.351.wav_ASR	and i think to talk about this story i think i'm going to talk about when i learned how to toast a turkey because at the time i did it i was asked if i could bake the bird
71-2_3836.08_11.38.wav_ASR	and of course growing up in an extended family which we had very very huge thanksgiving dinners by myself
71-2_3847.78_2.32.wav_ASR	generally we'd go to my grandmother's house
71-2_3850.98_1.12.wav_ASR	and she had eleven children
71-2_3852.94_2.427.wav_ASR	so our job
71-2_3855.367_3.059.wav_ASR	my father was the second oldest of that family
71-2_3859.04_2.22.wav_ASR	our job was to bring some pies
71-2_3861.92_7.327.wav_ASR	and usually we would bring something else whether it would be cranberry or something else bread sandwich
71-2_3869.707_2.393.wav_ASR	we never made the tour
71-2_3872.607_2.173.wav_ASR	we're never responsible for doing any of it
71-2_3874.78_1.654.wav_ASR	that and we which talk
71-2_3876.434_0.914.wav_ASR	they're gonna be playing football
71-2_3877.82_5.48.wav_ASR	you know i'd hang up with my in the kitchen with the women because they were kind of restricted that
71-2_3883.46_1.96.wav_ASR	and the man would be in the living room watching football
71-2_3886.28_4.902.wav_ASR	and yeah you would just try to deal with those journal
71-2_3891.42_2.44.wav_ASR	but in any case i was by myself
71-2_3893.937_6.46.wav_ASR	well i think it was a senior in
71-2_3903.017_2.6.wav_ASR	and i was working as a waiter
71-2_3906.217_1.753.wav_ASR	and i didn't have a car
71-2_3909.03_2.46.wav_ASR	and i couldn't get enough time off from work
71-2_3911.917_1.736.wav_ASR	they didn't have enough security there
71-2_3913.653_4.9.wav_ASR	so whatever reason i hadta work on wednesday before thanksgiving
71-2_3919.253_1.48.wav_ASR	and i was gonna be depressed
71-2_3920.873_2.933.wav_ASR	and i was gonna miss this big family event
71-2_3924.413_4.96.wav_ASR	but i decided that i was still going to make sure that i had the tracing
71-2_3929.773_1.74.wav_ASR	but i still had trouble
71-2_3931.715_1.84.wav_ASR	but i still had
71-2_3934.135_1.48.wav_ASR	that i still had tracheotomy
71-2_3935.995_1.437.wav_ASR	and those are the things i liked anyway
71-2_3937.995_2.438.wav_ASR	so i was gonna go through this because now i'm an adult right
71-2_3940.455_1.144.wav_ASR	and i know how to do all this
71-2_3941.995_1.475.wav_ASR	and why shouldn't i be able to do it
71-2_3943.535_0.973.wav_ASR	it can't be hard
71-2_3945.135_1.145.wav_ASR	it comes out the other
71-2_3946.495_1.92.wav_ASR	it looks like you turn the oven on
71-2_3948.615_1.065.wav_ASR	you put the turkey
71-2_3949.895_1.065.wav_ASR	they leave it in for a long time
71-2_3951.06_1.38.wav_ASR	five and eventually you pull it
71-2_3952.98_1.427.wav_ASR	and then you eat it right
71-2_3954.407_0.765.wav_ASR	and i can do that
71-2_3956.5_5.3.wav_ASR	so the tuesday before thanksgiving after i'm calling
71-2_3962.12_0.88.wav_ASR	and everyone's singing
71-2_3963.12_1.013.wav_ASR	you're not gonna be here
71-2_3964.3_1.612.wav_ASR	can't believe you're not gonna be
71-2_3965.912_1.841.wav_ASR	and feeling all depressed and all this
71-2_3967.94_2.64.wav_ASR	but i get how i pick up this bird
71-2_3970.948_2.557.wav_ASR	and i don't get a particularly big one
71-2_3973.708_0.995.wav_ASR	it's pretty big
71-2_3974.748_3.832.wav_ASR	probably like twenty pounds which is certainly more than i need
71-2_3979.388_1.599.wav_ASR	but you know i don't know
71-2_3981.128_5.18.wav_ASR	smaller than the ones that my family has ever used for thanksgiving
71-2_3986.648_1.44.wav_ASR	so i pick up this
71-2_3989.32_4.94.wav_ASR	after i get home from work on wednesday i pull it out of the fridge
71-2_3994.86_1.6.wav_ASR	you're kind of see where i'm going with this
71-2_3997.14_1.16.wav_ASR	and pulling out of the tree
71-2_3998.92_0.655.wav_ASR	and i said
71-2_3999.94_8.707.wav_ASR	well i think i probably if i put it in the morning on first tuesday morning i should be able to eat probably like four o'clock in the afternoon
71-2_4008.6_3.427.wav_ASR	and you know i heard you know how to make pies and all the other stuff
71-2_4012.36_2.28.wav_ASR	and i stick it in the
71-2_4015.16_2.54.wav_ASR	and i put tin foil over it
71-2_4018.12_1.74.wav_ASR	and i got the temperature record
71-2_4020.98_0.76.wav_ASR	put it in
71-2_4022.48_2.3.wav_ASR	and you know in the meantime i'm getting really hungry
71-2_4025.22_1.08.wav_ASR	see the day is going on
71-2_4026.96_2.58.wav_ASR	the other smells really good
71-2_4030.16_1.799.wav_ASR	and i've already got the pies that are there
71-2_4032.82_2.322.wav_ASR	so i bought the pie because i'd have time to bake them
71-2_4035.7_1.44.wav_ASR	and i go onto the school
71-2_4037.36_0.82.wav_ASR	and i'm watching tv
71-2_4038.6_1.326.wav_ASR	and so it's about four o'clock
71-2_4040.14_5.623.wav_ASR	and i invited my nextdoor neighbor to come over and help thank giving with me
71-2_4045.6_2.7.wav_ASR	and i pulled out the other
71-2_4048.88_8.18.wav_ASR	and i open the other door pull out the the turkey and take off the
71-2_4058.22_5.156.wav_ASR	and all of a sudden i notice i notices it's still kind of row on the top
71-2_4063.76_1.56.wav_ASR	it's
71-2_4065.473_3.02.wav_ASR	and what apparently i didn't understand you hadta throw them
71-2_4068.773_3.506.wav_ASR	and i i didn't know that there's actually a process that yes
71-2_4072.673_10.555.wav_ASR	so what i have is a turkey which is overcooked on the top part of it
71-2_4083.413_1.1.wav_ASR	there's blood everywhere
71-2_4084.791_4.6.wav_ASR	or you know when you waddle it you're sposta have clear shoes
71-2_4089.731_1.877.wav_ASR	and i'm having blood coming out of it
71-2_4092.3_1.672.wav_ASR	so i got my next door neighbor's name
71-2_4094.631_1.127.wav_ASR	so when are we gonna eat
71-2_4095.771_0.429.wav_ASR	and i said
71-2_4096.271_1.769.wav_ASR	well it looks like it's not done yet
71-2_4098.231_1.569.wav_ASR	and i don't know why is taking this long
71-2_4101.011_1.629.wav_ASR	and i said
71-2_4103.091_0.989.wav_ASR	well what's the pie
71-2_4104.66_1.34.wav_ASR	so i put it back in the up
71-2_4106.3_0.82.wav_ASR	we eat the pizza
71-2_4107.6_2.94.wav_ASR	we start eating you know whatever i've got in the house
71-2_4110.92_3.32.wav_ASR	and keep opening the oven door and checking it
71-2_4114.46_1.1.wav_ASR	well not done
71-2_4115.9_3.62.wav_ASR	and and finally at this point my my neighbor said
71-2_4119.66_2.687.wav_ASR	you know i'm not really hungry anymore because we've been eating
71-2_4122.347_5.32.wav_ASR	and i pick i had some macaroni and cheese in the refrigerator
71-2_4127.947_0.653.wav_ASR	we'd eaten that
71-2_4128.987_0.853.wav_ASR	we already had the phone
71-2_4130.887_1.513.wav_ASR	you know we eating other stuff
71-2_4132.587_2.053.wav_ASR	and i think we're drinking beer pretty much at that point
71-2_4135.127_1.673.wav_ASR	and it still just wasn't done
71-2_4136.987_0.32.wav_ASR	what's up
71-2_4137.427_1.789.wav_ASR	think there's something wrong with my arm
71-2_4139.216_4.64.wav_ASR	and for whatever reason this bird did not cook
71-2_4144.716_6.64.wav_ASR	so basically i finally took it out of the oven and stuck it back in the refrigerator
71-2_4152.1_1.576.wav_ASR	it was half cook
71-2_4154.1_6.54.wav_ASR	and then i found out the next day from my aunt that it was supposed to have been sad probably three or four days in advance
71-2_4161.66_3.14.wav_ASR	and that's that's the only way that it's cooked easily
71-2_4164.8_10.968.wav_ASR	and i never told anybody other than my aunt that the reason that my turkey did not work out is not because i forgot the thought
71-2_4175.98_2.66.wav_ASR	because i told him theoven just didn't work
71-2_4178.98_0.94.wav_ASR	and that's the prince
71-2_4180.26_1.499.wav_ASR	that's the one i went with right
71-2_4181.86_0.46.wav_ASR	well i did not
71-2_4182.62_1.64.wav_ASR	they would've laughed at me forever
71-2_4184.269_5.704.wav_ASR	or they've recruited me for decades for not knowing something as basic as that
71-2_4190.749_3.091.wav_ASR	but it's the first bird i ever tried to
71-2_4194.709_2.56.wav_ASR	there's they needta tell you the details
71-2_4197.749_2.931.wav_ASR	meanwhile there's more involved than just sticking in the
71-2_4201.309_1.4.wav_ASR	so anyway yes
71-2_4202.869_1.276.wav_ASR	and i didn't even tell you
71-2_4204.145_0.66.wav_ASR	well i didn't take it
71-2_4205.385_11.22.wav_ASR	the neck was actually inside paper and was stuck inside the journal which didn't even know because it was too frozen
71-2_4217.465_4.355.wav_ASR	so when i finally was able to get it out i had paper in there too on top
71-2_4222.245_1.467.wav_ASR	kind of massage
71-2_4223.712_2.033.wav_ASR	well eventually i ate it
71-2_4225.772_5.36.wav_ASR	and i just hacked it up then kind of cooked it in se
71-2_4231.613_1.392.wav_ASR	spoon spoon use it all
71-2_4244.36_0.39.wav_ASR	and i said
71-2_4246.12_3.22.wav_ASR	oh okay
71-2_4250.31_12.91.wav_ASR	and going to talk about a hotel that i stayed in when i was living in cuban and was traveling with five other people
71-2_4263.273_6.26.wav_ASR	now in this particular case what had happened is we were on christmas break
71-2_4270.133_3.68.wav_ASR	so we had a month off in which there were no classes
71-2_4274.793_1.429.wav_ASR	and so all of us
71-2_4276.413_2.08.wav_ASR	we're about twenty five of us there
71-2_4278.663_5.439.wav_ASR	we were between the ages of nineteen and twenty one and were in europe
71-2_4284.483_8.28.wav_ASR	and we have the ability to be able to buy you rail passes which means limited travel
71-2_4293.323_0.72.wav_ASR	you basically
71-2_4294.543_3.437.wav_ASR	and i can't remember what it cost at this point
71-2_4297.98_2.54.wav_ASR	but i think it was about a hundred dollars you paid
71-2_4300.82_16.44.wav_ASR	and you could essentially go anywhere anywhere as far south as jesus and as far north as philly as long as it was this railroad
71-2_4317.626_3.34.wav_ASR	so you know we had all these ways of trying to do it cheap
71-2_4321.286_2.024.wav_ASR	and we'd sleep on trains
71-2_4323.546_4.404.wav_ASR	we would take things at night so that we wouldn't hafta worry about it
71-2_4328.866_1.9.wav_ASR	but we were now
71-2_4331.086_2.44.wav_ASR	we're several of us that were traveling
71-2_4333.686_1.58.wav_ASR	it was with a friend called firstnamec
71-2_4335.298_4.36.wav_ASR	and we were connecting in with firstnames and firstnamec
71-2_4339.721_2.975.wav_ASR	and and they were coming
71-2_4342.838_1.313.wav_ASR	they had traveled from somewhere else
71-2_4344.198_2.045.wav_ASR	we're all gonna meet together in rom
71-2_4346.718_4.949.wav_ASR	and we figured we would all stay in a hotel together to save money you know
71-2_4351.738_2.52.wav_ASR	you would have i think two babies
71-2_4354.57_1.472.wav_ASR	so so there was captain
71-2_4356.47_1.518.wav_ASR	and one of us would sleep with firstnamec
71-2_4357.988_3.735.wav_ASR	and and then two women would be in the other bed
71-2_4362.65_1.8.wav_ASR	so it's new york state right
71-2_4364.61_1.672.wav_ASR	because this is christmas
71-2_4366.73_2.06.wav_ASR	we arrive in raleigh
71-2_4369.51_2.46.wav_ASR	and the first thing we we would do when
71-2_4372.105_3.44.wav_ASR	and we were gonna meet with each other at the train station
71-2_4376.45_1.74.wav_ASR	we all met at the train station
71-2_4378.485_2.025.wav_ASR	we all got in with a half an hour of each other
71-2_4380.725_0.585.wav_ASR	we connected
71-2_4381.31_17.334.wav_ASR	the first thing we would always do is go to the the information center in the train station and get the maps and find out what's going on in the city and where the chief hotels are and you know basically what were gonna be doing
71-2_4399.31_1.66.wav_ASR	there's a guy there working
71-2_4400.97_1.48.wav_ASR	and he was about twenty
71-2_4402.65_5.436.wav_ASR	very attractive italian man who said
71-2_4408.77_2.324.wav_ASR	and he was just starting flashing with us to see
71-2_4410.93_1.58.wav_ASR	well there's three american women
71-2_4412.97_0.805.wav_ASR	is this one guy
71-2_4414.09_1.187.wav_ASR	and he's traveling with us
71-2_4415.73_2.32.wav_ASR	and and he just said
71-2_4418.51_1.44.wav_ASR	oh you're gonna be in firstnamer
71-2_4420.19_0.352.wav_ASR	and we says
71-2_4420.542_1.785.wav_ASR	yeah we're gonna be in a couple of days
71-2_4423.022_0.528.wav_ASR	here's a plan
71-2_4423.642_1.191.wav_ASR	well we don't have plan
71-2_4425.142_0.92.wav_ASR	we're just traveling
71-2_4426.362_1.68.wav_ASR	and we're open to any experience
71-2_4428.462_0.4.wav_ASR	and he said
71-2_4428.922_1.677.wav_ASR	well we're gonna be having a party tonight
71-2_4431.182_1.62.wav_ASR	would you like to come to our party
71-2_4433.777_1.345.wav_ASR	and of course you know
71-2_4435.601_1.401.wav_ASR	of course people come to her party
71-2_4437.262_1.273.wav_ASR	we don't know anybody here
71-2_4438.722_1.324.wav_ASR	of course we'll come to your parties
71-2_4440.046_0.685.wav_ASR	it's new york see
71-2_4440.731_1.855.wav_ASR	we loved to go to an italian party
71-2_4442.966_1.106.wav_ASR	and yeah the
71-2_4444.486_4.06.wav_ASR	we've seen the movie the taking taking which means it coulda gone very differently
71-2_4448.786_0.842.wav_ASR	that's not what happened
71-2_4450.606_1.32.wav_ASR	so we get to our hotel
71-2_4453.086_0.895.wav_ASR	and we checked in
71-2_4454.966_4.62.wav_ASR	and the guy behind the desk looked at all of us and said
71-2_4459.59_1.88.wav_ASR	do you all wanna be in one room together
71-2_4462.21_0.62.wav_ASR	and we said
71-2_4463.448_1.886.wav_ASR	one one room two beds
71-2_4466.53_1.558.wav_ASR	and he looked at firstnamek
71-2_4468.088_2.082.wav_ASR	and and he pulled him aside and said
71-2_4470.79_1.3.wav_ASR	you must not be italian
71-2_4472.41_4.094.wav_ASR	if i was in that room i would not be able to sleep the entire night
71-2_4476.504_3.19.wav_ASR	the entire night with all of these beautiful women around
71-2_4480.57_2.338.wav_ASR	and he hadn't come out yet
71-2_4482.944_3.806.wav_ASR	but it about a year later after that when we all had a reunion
71-2_4487.104_0.926.wav_ASR	now i'm gay
71-2_4488.81_0.614.wav_ASR	and i said
71-2_4489.544_1.514.wav_ASR	oh we we didn't know that
71-2_4491.584_4.638.wav_ASR	yeah then i was thinking at the time you know he he actually didn't know he was gay
71-2_4496.25_7.099.wav_ASR	but he said one of the things that made clear to him that he was gay as when that italian man had said
71-2_4504.19_3.358.wav_ASR	well i wouldn't be able to sleep if i were in the room with these beautiful women
71-2_4508.07_0.96.wav_ASR	and he was thinking
71-2_4509.29_1.838.wav_ASR	you know i'm not interested in anything
71-2_4511.51_1.94.wav_ASR	yes certainly bit
71-2_4513.97_1.867.wav_ASR	well maybe there's a reason for that
71-2_4515.85_1.695.wav_ASR	yeah but i don't know
71-2_4518.19_2.637.wav_ASR	so we we actually stopped with firstnamec
71-2_4520.91_0.704.wav_ASR	that was
71-2_4523.37_1.48.wav_ASR	and i mean there was no
71-2_4525.51_3.045.wav_ASR	it didn't matter i mean who we're gonna sleep with
71-2_4528.59_1.436.wav_ASR	he was like my brother at that point
71-2_4530.79_1.74.wav_ASR	so firstnamek and i slept in one bed
71-2_4532.73_0.64.wav_ASR	it was a dog
71-2_4533.83_2.42.wav_ASR	and firstnamesc and firstnamek slipped in the other one
71-2_4536.43_6.242.wav_ASR	and we put all our stuff up you know our backpacks and our sleeping bag
71-2_4542.95_1.454.wav_ASR	and we all went to this party
71-2_4544.65_2.441.wav_ASR	and everybody's really well dressed at this party
71-2_4547.69_2.18.wav_ASR	and we're jeans
71-2_4558.543_1.81.wav_ASR	and everybody's all made up
71-2_4560.543_2.446.wav_ASR	and there we are looking looking like we look
71-2_4563.963_5.82.wav_ASR	and the whole thing at the party became the focus of
71-2_4569.795_5.22.wav_ASR	so this guy is sleeping with all three of us in the hotel
71-2_4575.455_8.129.wav_ASR	well that's all we talked about all night long was just that firstnamec had three different women that he was having sex with
71-2_4583.835_2.445.wav_ASR	and so you know
71-2_4586.535_3.105.wav_ASR	well i could be an american man and travel with three women
71-2_4589.64_1.073.wav_ASR	and you know it
71-2_4591.62_1.186.wav_ASR	oh firstnamek was so embarrassed
71-2_4593.08_2.472.wav_ASR	oh so oh embarrassed by the whole thing
71-2_4595.68_0.879.wav_ASR	and we
71-2_4597.78_4.75.wav_ASR	well what's interesting is on the way back we stopped again in the bathroom
71-2_4602.76_3.63.wav_ASR	firstnamek came out of the men's bathroom and said
71-2_4607.06_1.72.wav_ASR	and i just had the stroke and came
71-2_4609.0_0.74.wav_ASR	and we go
71-2_4609.96_0.5.wav_ASR	how happy
71-2_4610.475_1.125.wav_ASR	he thought
71-2_4611.66_1.84.wav_ASR	well i was at the earlham
71-2_4614.02_1.751.wav_ASR	and i was standing there
71-2_4615.94_0.733.wav_ASR	and i was peeing
71-2_4617.72_1.59.wav_ASR	and all of a sudden this man came
71-2_4619.54_4.24.wav_ASR	and he couldn't have gone to the other side of the row ofirl
71-2_4624.08_1.411.wav_ASR	he came and stood right next to me
71-2_4626.74_0.6.wav_ASR	and he said
71-2_4627.405_1.298.wav_ASR	and i don't know what that means
71-2_4628.703_0.68.wav_ASR	and i said
71-2_4630.703_0.392.wav_ASR	oh maybe
71-2_4631.095_1.208.wav_ASR	it's italian you know
71-2_4632.523_0.44.wav_ASR	and he said
71-2_4633.223_4.051.wav_ASR	and he had the biggest peanut i'd ever seen
71-2_4637.563_0.429.wav_ASR	oh
71-2_4638.163_1.275.wav_ASR	so so how do i
71-2_4640.283_2.322.wav_ASR	thinking about that a year later it kind of made sense
71-2_4642.723_0.997.wav_ASR	and the time is
71-2_4643.84_0.556.wav_ASR	well i don't know
71-2_4644.543_1.18.wav_ASR	maybe this is what it's telling
71-2_4645.732_10.149.wav_ASR	and we just thought italian men were so strange that someone would not be able to sleep when he's exhausted because
71-2_4656.872_1.771.wav_ASR	and i could not sleep if i was in that room
71-2_4658.952_2.411.wav_ASR	well i just couldn't imagine all those women around him
71-2_4661.432_1.043.wav_ASR	we're sharing a bathroom
71-2_4663.072_0.5.wav_ASR	oh my
71-2_4663.885_1.9.wav_ASR	oh so anyway yes
71-2_4665.989_3.342.wav_ASR	that's better than the one where i hadta say
71-2_4669.685_0.92.wav_ASR	we have a fax machine
71-2_4670.828_2.306.wav_ASR	and so which is what i taught you last week
71-2_4673.345_2.38.wav_ASR	but i don't have a lot of hospital story
71-2_4676.085_0.796.wav_ASR	yes anyway
71-2_4677.505_0.76.wav_ASR	that was nice
71-2_4683.67_0.73.wav_ASR	thank you
71-2_4684.79_1.88.wav_ASR	we've already talked about my okey
71-2_4687.29_1.19.wav_ASR	so i come up with a different word
71-2_4688.98_22.04.wav_ASR	and i useta have this thing that i would do to family members and friends which involved them in restaurants on their holidays their birthdays in particular
71-2_4711.28_5.98.wav_ASR	and what i would do is i would usually go quiet
71-2_4718.12_0.593.wav_ASR	and i get up
71-2_4718.88_1.542.wav_ASR	and i would excuse myself in the taxi
71-2_4720.7_0.485.wav_ASR	and i would go
71-2_4721.32_1.92.wav_ASR	and i would talk to the waiters
71-2_4723.38_1.18.wav_ASR	and i would say something like
71-2_4724.78_0.758.wav_ASR	what is my cousin
71-2_4725.64_1.14.wav_ASR	it's his birthday today
71-2_4727.48_2.1.wav_ASR	he doesn't like any attention
71-2_4729.698_4.925.wav_ASR	and so is there any point in time in which you could bring us a cake
71-2_4734.623_3.695.wav_ASR	and then we could really embarrass him by singing really loudly all around
71-2_4738.31_3.62.wav_ASR	and usually the waitress staff they're always
71-2_4742.318_0.971.wav_ASR	we didn't love to do that
71-2_4743.298_0.762.wav_ASR	that would be fun
71-2_4744.738_1.792.wav_ASR	so i had this thing about doing that
71-2_4746.63_5.9.wav_ASR	and and very often i would bring my own candles the kind that don't blow up
71-2_4752.99_5.848.wav_ASR	the oh you know they they relate because then you can really really embarrassed people
71-2_4758.97_1.497.wav_ASR	yes that was my place
71-2_4761.43_2.915.wav_ASR	so it was my cousin's birthday
71-2_4764.86_4.14.wav_ASR	and his relationship with his girlfriend had just ended
71-2_4769.48_3.76.wav_ASR	and he's always kind of quiet and and shy
71-2_4774.06_7.648.wav_ASR	so i decided that what we should really do is we should call a lot of attention to him because this would be good for him
71-2_4782.483_4.66.wav_ASR	so there were about fifteen of us there in the family
71-2_4787.403_2.28.wav_ASR	we weren't all sitting in the same
71-2_4790.743_1.267.wav_ASR	we're running in the same boat
71-2_4792.783_6.78.wav_ASR	well i decided that would actually add to the event if we had people singing from a distance around him
71-2_4800.425_7.26.wav_ASR	well i i took my knee and knee with me to talk to the waitress staff
71-2_4808.085_1.875.wav_ASR	and firstnamem was then sick
71-2_4810.545_1.415.wav_ASR	and firstnamee was eight
71-2_4812.62_1.14.wav_ASR	so they came with me
71-2_4813.825_0.36.wav_ASR	and i said
71-2_4814.405_1.486.wav_ASR	what's what we're gonna do to den
71-2_4815.905_1.236.wav_ASR	and we're gonna go there
71-2_4817.285_1.99.wav_ASR	and we're going to surprise him on his birthday
71-2_4819.275_11.285.wav_ASR	so what we hafta do is is we hafta make sure that everybody understands that they're gonna hafta start to sing at some point and that they shouldn't know in advance
71-2_4831.135_4.64.wav_ASR	so firstnamed is over talking to i don't know some other relatives
71-2_4836.42_3.78.wav_ASR	and firstnamem and firstnamee and i are running around talking to everyone
71-2_4840.48_2.887.wav_ASR	okay now you hafta sing very loud
71-2_4843.64_1.672.wav_ASR	you gotta be very very quiet
71-2_4845.6_1.096.wav_ASR	yes yes
71-2_4847.02_9.14.wav_ASR	so he hears firstnamem talking to the i think it was his brother probably my other cousin saying
71-2_4856.255_2.8.wav_ASR	now remember to sing very very loud
71-2_4859.535_1.02.wav_ASR	the hospital
71-2_4861.135_1.305.wav_ASR	enjoying this whole progress
71-2_4864.14_0.78.wav_ASR	and i know we're just like
71-2_4865.495_0.665.wav_ASR	couldn't be so good
71-2_4866.355_0.48.wav_ASR	and he's kinda
71-2_4867.715_1.611.wav_ASR	what are they going to do
71-2_4869.355_1.262.wav_ASR	he knew something was coming
71-2_4871.42_5.18.wav_ASR	but he didn't know about the type of protection that we had put in
71-2_4876.94_5.5.wav_ASR	didn't know about the special candles that wouldn't burn out
71-2_4882.7_11.06.wav_ASR	he didn't know that we're gonna get the the entire waste waste waiting staff waiting staff people who were waiting on the tables to bring it
71-2_4894.34_6.12.wav_ASR	and he didn't know that everybody in my family would really enjoy the tiny process that were right
71-2_4900.46_6.912.wav_ASR	and you know we get very kind of loud when we do things like this
71-2_4907.74_2.645.wav_ASR	yeah of course they came from behind
71-2_4910.64_5.579.wav_ASR	and i only thought one food server was going to bring the cake
71-2_4917.02_1.8.wav_ASR	and dead we had the six or so
71-2_4919.0_1.337.wav_ASR	everybody is tired to come along
71-2_4920.337_2.048.wav_ASR	oh my god i'm gonna people
71-2_4922.677_1.435.wav_ASR	it came from behind
71-2_4924.697_6.411.wav_ASR	he could tell that it was coming because everybody on the other side or raining and looking at him
71-2_4931.777_2.24.wav_ASR	and firstnamem and firstnamee are just laugh
71-2_4934.457_1.743.wav_ASR	well really putting around and telling
71-2_4936.937_0.93.wav_ASR	it's fine to sing now
71-2_4938.097_0.862.wav_ASR	it's fine to singing
71-2_4938.959_2.806.wav_ASR	and he got dream got done
71-2_4941.979_0.74.wav_ASR	he died
71-2_4943.099_1.014.wav_ASR	you blew it out
71-2_4944.419_1.009.wav_ASR	came back up again
71-2_4945.559_0.321.wav_ASR	and i said
71-2_4946.139_1.029.wav_ASR	you must be getting all
71-2_4947.999_3.841.wav_ASR	how do you at least have the ability to blow out the candle
71-2_4951.84_1.08.wav_ASR	well can you at least do it
71-2_4953.279_0.841.wav_ASR	and then
71-2_4955.019_0.65.wav_ASR	come firstnamem
71-2_4955.879_0.703.wav_ASR	what's going on
71-2_4956.739_1.861.wav_ASR	and he's looking at me
71-2_4958.6_2.165.wav_ASR	and he got down and said
71-2_4961.02_4.396.wav_ASR	and no firstnamep i'm gonna remember this
71-2_4965.96_1.081.wav_ASR	well i'm gonna remember that
71-2_4967.18_0.36.wav_ASR	and i said
71-2_4967.76_1.097.wav_ASR	was it a surprise
71-2_4968.88_0.538.wav_ASR	yes you said
71-2_4969.54_2.689.wav_ASR	it was not a surprise when i heard firstnamem saying
71-2_4972.7_2.78.wav_ASR	remember to sing very very loud
71-2_4976.56_11.193.wav_ASR	so i i you know i i think i handed the waitress i think i gave her like twenty dollars or something what she had done because she carried it off so well
71-2_4988.7_0.52.wav_ASR	what's the word
71-2_4989.46_1.132.wav_ASR	it was so much fun
71-2_4990.7_0.32.wav_ASR	and she says
71-2_4991.1_1.881.wav_ASR	how amazingly is so much fun
71-2_4992.981_3.44.wav_ASR	and and den just looked at me and just
71-2_4998.102_3.085.wav_ASR	well alright anyway that was fine
71-2_5001.681_0.427.wav_ASR	and that is
71-2_5016.87_9.94.wav_ASR	back in the days when i would make peanut butter and jelly sandwich because of course i can't anymore for all sorts of reasons
71-2_5026.95_5.193.wav_ASR	shopper is satisfied fast and too much sugar and all the rest of it
71-2_5032.23_5.632.wav_ASR	but back in the days when i would've done this i would've started out with the bread
71-2_5038.61_13.295.wav_ASR	and i would've toasted it because the tester of toast works better for me than it does with toasted bread when it comes to peanut butter and jelly
71-2_5052.65_3.64.wav_ASR	so i would begin by putting it in the toaster
71-2_5056.23_6.16.wav_ASR	and while it's tossing up i would pull out the peanut butter and the jelly
71-2_5063.89_6.546.wav_ASR	when the bread comes out of the toaster i would begin with the peanut butter
71-2_5070.71_0.899.wav_ASR	that goes on the bottom
71-2_5071.89_4.232.wav_ASR	what i would do with a knife is i would pull out some peanut butter
71-2_5076.47_2.8.wav_ASR	and i would spread it evenly on the bread
71-2_5079.93_2.64.wav_ASR	then i would take the other piece of toast
71-2_5083.17_7.54.wav_ASR	and i would take a spoon and spoon out some jelly
71-2_5091.25_1.174.wav_ASR	read it around even
71-2_5093.29_1.54.wav_ASR	and then put the two of them together
71-2_5095.33_3.74.wav_ASR	and probably slice it before eat it
71-2_5100.37_1.46.wav_ASR	and i don't eat things like that anymore
71-2_5102.25_1.58.wav_ASR	that's how i would do it
71-2_5111.35_0.5.wav_ASR	okay
71-2_5112.173_4.003.wav_ASR	well i think we talked about this last week
71-2_5116.353_4.662.wav_ASR	well i'm not done my laundry since last week which is really needed to do at this point
71-2_5122.17_24.64.wav_ASR	when i do laundry when i'm able to do is not separate them separate them from color and white because i've gotten to the point that i only buy clothes that can all be washed in cold water which is also much better for the emergency
71-2_5147.64_14.38.wav_ASR	so all of my dirty laundry is already put aside because as clothes begin to fail the smell test they end up in my
71-2_5163.84_1.68.wav_ASR	so when it's time to do laundry
71-2_5205.68_2.96.wav_ASR	my plan is probably tomorrow after
71-2_5208.96_5.54.wav_ASR	we have a brake in between two different appointments that will allow me to do that
71-2_5214.8_4.46.wav_ASR	and what i'm going to do is i pull into the laundry which is on east boston
71-2_5221.0_3.28.wav_ASR	oh i think it's about twenty one hundred
71-2_5224.612_5.38.wav_ASR	one i will walk into a medium size washing machine
71-2_5230.452_2.529.wav_ASR	and i will put all of my laundry in
71-2_5233.212_2.606.wav_ASR	well not separate it by color or white
71-2_5236.572_4.435.wav_ASR	and i will then add the soup sorry the soup at the top of it
71-2_5241.89_6.96.wav_ASR	then i will put in enough carrots to be able to begin the cycle
71-2_5249.67_3.44.wav_ASR	and i will wash on my clothes on first
71-2_5253.83_7.3.wav_ASR	after the court's are in i push the cold water water
71-2_5261.412_5.86.wav_ASR	and then i take note of the fact it will take twenty five minutes for it to wash
71-2_5300.51_7.94.wav_ASR	because it's tunnels and swatters and things and swaths that will take longer to to dry
71-2_5309.73_7.36.wav_ASR	and then i throw it all back in the hamper and take it home and then sometimes unfold it or put it away
71-2_5317.17_8.72.wav_ASR	and sometimes i just take right out of the clean hamper and put it on my my body or my bed or whatever i need it
71-2_5335.726_1.6.wav_ASR	kind of
71-2_5338.086_0.904.wav_ASR	well i've never done that
71-2_5339.206_1.26.wav_ASR	and i have try
71-2_5341.05_1.916.wav_ASR	well make very clear that i have try
71-2_5343.826_8.14.wav_ASR	and have not ever succeeded in doing so for different reasons
71-2_5352.99_2.016.wav_ASR	if i wanted to do it correct
71-2_5355.43_3.92.wav_ASR	and this is what it says on the seed
71-2_5360.33_1.64.wav_ASR	which has never worked for me
71-2_5362.41_2.88.wav_ASR	well this is essentially the way that we would do it
71-2_5365.51_1.04.wav_ASR	and i would get
71-2_5368.81_1.36.wav_ASR	or i would get
71-2_5370.83_2.38.wav_ASR	and i would go to a plant
71-2_5374.88_3.677.wav_ASR	and there is one that's about a mile and half from where i live
71-2_5378.64_3.28.wav_ASR	and you buy a special type of
71-2_5384.1_1.523.wav_ASR	it it comes in a bag
71-2_5385.8_1.105.wav_ASR	and i think it's it's
71-2_5387.32_6.933.wav_ASR	well i know it's it's lateral enough that you should be able to grow things on it
71-2_5394.253_3.88.wav_ASR	and i would put this into a pot
71-2_5398.493_12.547.wav_ASR	and i would make sure that there was a hole in it for legge so that if you put the water in the water if it's essential water will be able to drain out into a tray
71-2_5412.06_6.94.wav_ASR	put the pot near a window so that there's enough space
71-2_5420.54_3.72.wav_ASR	and what i would do is make sure that the
71-2_5424.56_4.012.wav_ASR	the first i would read the directions on the seat package which i've done before
71-2_5429.36_2.358.wav_ASR	you hafta go down about two inches
71-2_5431.718_2.05.wav_ASR	you take a seed
71-2_5434.438_1.243.wav_ASR	you place it
71-2_5436.118_0.689.wav_ASR	you cover
71-2_5437.218_1.782.wav_ASR	you water it
71-2_5439.278_1.558.wav_ASR	and then you leave it alone
71-2_5441.258_2.82.wav_ASR	and supposedly nature takes its course
71-2_5444.438_5.88.wav_ASR	in my particular situation one time i didn't have enough sun
71-2_5451.69_10.26.wav_ASR	another time i simply overwatered it to the point that the soil was so saturated that the seed root
71-2_5463.05_8.069.wav_ASR	and i think the other time it just was too cold in my apartment to be able to sprout in the way that it was supposed to
71-2_5471.119_2.542.wav_ASR	but i've seen other people do it
71-2_5473.819_1.78.wav_ASR	and i know the process exists
71-2_5475.839_4.031.wav_ASR	and i've just been able to actually do it in a way that makes it actually work
71-2_5480.75_10.703.wav_ASR	so yeah i'm still in the potential status of stage of understanding of what you're sposta be able to do
71-2_5491.453_11.589.wav_ASR	but i haven't yet figured out how to keep the soil dry enough so that it it can sprout without me overwatering it to the point that i rot it
71-2_5503.85_5.443.wav_ASR	so i think there's a balance i haven't yet achieved to be able to do it
84-1_17.07_2.48.wav_ASR	and i would hafta say one of my favorite trips
84-1_19.816_4.091.wav_ASR	my wife and i have two sons that are older now
84-1_24.096_5.94.wav_ASR	and for a number of years we went skiing in utah in parksville
84-1_31.276_2.24.wav_ASR	and i really enjoyed the opera
84-1_33.838_6.2.wav_ASR	so my youngest was probably about three years old and my oldest was probably
84-1_40.738_1.181.wav_ASR	well it's probably the later
84-1_42.198_2.46.wav_ASR	me five and
84-1_45.878_4.42.wav_ASR	and it was just so much fun to get out there and and
84-1_50.529_3.88.wav_ASR	and i i could ski already but my my two kids
84-1_55.149_1.45.wav_ASR	my wife scared a little bit
84-1_56.809_3.24.wav_ASR	my two kids became pretty good skiers
84-1_60.329_3.354.wav_ASR	and i am pretty sure that a lot of them was
84-1_63.693_8.407.wav_ASR	we had a guy when we were in in
84-1_72.333_1.915.wav_ASR	well i just lost the name of the place
84-1_74.633_3.58.wav_ASR	and when we were in utah
84-1_78.653_2.88.wav_ASR	and we were gated with him for a number of years and
84-1_81.538_1.66.wav_ASR	he did a really good job
84-1_83.198_9.633.wav_ASR	well i hope that will give you a little bit of sense of how much i enjoy skiing with number two how much i enjoyed skiing with them when i couldn't
84-1_100.218_1.397.wav_ASR	it it was very nice
84-1_127.149_12.52.wav_ASR	well i just got accepted to be part of the bar again in philadelphia and pennsylvania
84-1_141.089_3.08.wav_ASR	and i would say my my skills
84-1_144.711_5.549.wav_ASR	and i i i think my skills are pretty good
84-1_150.311_2.822.wav_ASR	they're never gonna be great as they once were
84-1_153.811_8.199.wav_ASR	so i would say on a scale of one to ten right now i would say i'm probably assess
84-1_162.21_3.04.wav_ASR	and so i feel like i'm made a lot of progress
84-1_165.81_5.761.wav_ASR	but i know that there's more progress i need to make especially with with big words
84-1_172.07_1.91.wav_ASR	big words can be difficult for me
84-1_174.17_3.53.wav_ASR	so i do see a speech therapist once a week
84-1_177.77_3.733.wav_ASR	and she's been extremely extremely healthy for me
84-1_181.503_0.887.wav_ASR	and i like her
84-1_182.39_6.734.wav_ASR	and i also have somebody to work out with me
84-1_189.203_1.429.wav_ASR	the two of them are just great
84-1_196.9_1.27.wav_ASR	oh i remember that pretty well
84-1_207.12_2.95.wav_ASR	well my wife was away for the week
84-1_210.39_2.78.wav_ASR	we had a house in oxford maryland
84-1_214.15_3.64.wav_ASR	and i remember that weekend because i hadta work
84-1_217.968_4.82.wav_ASR	and i thought the biggest thing we i could do for the weekend was to stay home
84-1_223.738_8.03.wav_ASR	so i think she probably went down there on maybe wednesday or thursday
84-1_232.508_2.66.wav_ASR	and i came home from work on friday
84-1_236.128_0.848.wav_ASR	and i had dinner
84-1_236.976_0.998.wav_ASR	and i did some work
84-1_238.176_2.0.wav_ASR	and i get up the next morning
84-1_240.536_5.24.wav_ASR	that was the thirty thirtieth
84-1_247.676_1.721.wav_ASR	and i felt pretty good
84-1_249.716_1.188.wav_ASR	and i went about my day
84-1_251.576_2.08.wav_ASR	and i went out for a bicycle ride
84-1_254.296_1.0.wav_ASR	and i came home
84-1_255.22_20.6.wav_ASR	and that night that firstnamel it was i think like a week or two a week maybe after firstnamef was killed in in minneapolis
84-1_276.504_5.66.wav_ASR	and so on saturday night i went to bed a little bit early
84-1_282.524_4.46.wav_ASR	well i i thought there might be some bicycle
84-1_287.724_3.66.wav_ASR	and i also thought it would be helpful in the mornings
84-1_291.464_1.784.wav_ASR	so i could clean up a little bit
84-1_293.7_2.69.wav_ASR	so we live in a fairly nice area
84-1_297.14_2.43.wav_ASR	and i went to bed around ten third
84-1_300.6_5.7.wav_ASR	and that night saturday night there was a lot of violence in in cinderella
84-1_307.16_3.84.wav_ASR	and i remember that that a birthday was born
84-1_315.929_2.242.wav_ASR	and so i got up
84-1_318.529_2.98.wav_ASR	well i live in a fairly secure place
84-1_322.129_4.884.wav_ASR	and the next morning i got up really early and went outside
84-1_327.229_1.08.wav_ASR	it was a total mess
84-1_329.189_1.324.wav_ASR	so i started cleaning up
84-1_331.129_3.4.wav_ASR	and sometimes the during the day i felt a little bit she
84-1_334.969_1.819.wav_ASR	so i went back home
84-1_337.0_1.019.wav_ASR	and i rested for a little
84-1_338.309_1.26.wav_ASR	went out and got a paper
84-1_340.069_2.184.wav_ASR	and then i felt pretty good for the rest of the day
84-1_342.769_10.717.wav_ASR	and sometime on that sunday night between may thirty first and august i mean and june first i had my stroke
84-1_354.11_3.04.wav_ASR	and in the morning my wife could not get a hold of me
84-1_357.75_1.397.wav_ASR	so we have a doormat here
84-1_359.39_0.831.wav_ASR	and he went up
84-1_360.85_1.3.wav_ASR	and i was on the floor
84-1_362.37_2.0.wav_ASR	and so he called an ambulance
84-1_364.67_4.58.wav_ASR	my wife was in oakford maryland
84-1_369.477_7.22.wav_ASR	so she was told that i had better that
84-1_377.397_1.08.wav_ASR	and bad with firstnamer
84-1_378.897_3.68.wav_ASR	that my wife should come home
84-1_382.428_8.24.wav_ASR	and i have two sons one who's in new york and one who's in san francisco
84-1_391.348_6.86.wav_ASR	and they were told it was probably a good idea for them to come home because i wasn't sure what was gonna happen
84-1_398.267_6.5.wav_ASR	and so i remember distinctly that i was brought into the emergency room
84-1_405.227_2.72.wav_ASR	and apparently i i could not say a lot about them
84-1_407.987_2.86.wav_ASR	my my voice was very garbled
84-1_411.47_14.3.wav_ASR	but the end by the end of the procedure my my wife told me later that she thought i wasn't sure what kind of shape i'd be
84-1_425.77_14.463.wav_ASR	but by the end of the surgery which was i had a blood vessel i was able she thought the surgeon thought that i was going to be able to live
84-1_440.31_3.579.wav_ASR	they didn't know how much exactly i'll be able to do
84-1_444.38_6.0.wav_ASR	so i i spent about six eight weeks in rehab
84-1_451.21_2.29.wav_ASR	and i came out not sure what i could do
84-1_453.84_4.18.wav_ASR	so today i i feel pretty good about my voice
84-1_458.6_2.9.wav_ASR	there's more i can do
84-1_462.06_4.25.wav_ASR	so as i said i think i'm about seventy percent right now
84-1_478.63_9.28.wav_ASR	well i was in the hospital i was in rehab for eight weeks about a place that's about maybe eight blocks from here
84-1_488.29_1.76.wav_ASR	and it was a time when it was covid
84-1_490.47_3.04.wav_ASR	so it wasn't really easy for me to see people
84-1_494.13_3.84.wav_ASR	but one of the people where we live
84-1_498.084_2.28.wav_ASR	because i live in a high story building
84-1_501.2_9.29.wav_ASR	one of the person was maybe the second or third command at jefferson which is where i went to for my rehab
84-1_511.17_8.41.wav_ASR	and this person whose name is firstnamek they were allowed to get two people in to see me at day
84-1_520.09_3.903.wav_ASR	oh i i got to see well my two sisters came in
84-1_524.19_2.789.wav_ASR	and my my children came in
84-1_527.21_2.02.wav_ASR	and then my wife came in
84-1_529.33_4.5.wav_ASR	so i had a very good treatment
84-1_534.47_8.45.wav_ASR	and so each day i would have o t p t and speech
84-1_543.73_2.66.wav_ASR	that was every day except for saturdays and sundays
84-1_554.07_3.15.wav_ASR	well what then there's nothing i can do about it
84-1_558.98_2.94.wav_ASR	so i i mean i understood i hadta deal with that
84-1_562.65_2.916.wav_ASR	and i didn't always deal with it but i try to
84-1_590.17_3.99.wav_ASR	well i hafta tell you i've had a pretty good life until my stroke
84-1_595.73_3.421.wav_ASR	and i would say that one of the best things that ever happened to me was
84-1_599.151_7.46.wav_ASR	and i was in a program at a school called wesley which is in midtown connecticut
84-1_607.212_12.7.wav_ASR	and when i was there part of this this program i was in this conference responded made it so that i hadta spend a semester of
84-1_620.93_9.96.wav_ASR	and during starting in seventh grade through high school and then into college i spoke french french french pretty well
84-1_631.61_7.66.wav_ASR	because i had a teacher in in firstnamew who was at the time going out with one of the cubs baseball players
84-1_639.596_3.36.wav_ASR	and so she was french
84-1_643.098_1.783.wav_ASR	and she useta talk about that a lot
84-1_645.456_2.323.wav_ASR	and so i took a class from her
84-1_648.376_1.811.wav_ASR	and somehow i did pretty well
84-1_650.376_6.36.wav_ASR	so when i was in the program at at westminster
84-1_657.064_3.6.wav_ASR	and i would say one of the happiest occasions for me was graduation
84-1_661.59_8.094.wav_ASR	and i i i wound up doing pretty well at the school and even though i had gotten in on a wait list
84-1_670.684_1.52.wav_ASR	and it was really exciting
84-1_672.25_9.12.wav_ASR	and i i i knew a bunch of people in my class but i was really close with the class of eighty
84-1_681.67_2.875.wav_ASR	and it was just a fun time for me
84-1_684.545_1.765.wav_ASR	and i was president of my funeral
84-1_687.01_6.06.wav_ASR	and i i i met someone who became one of my closest friends
84-1_693.27_2.1.wav_ASR	he was the proposed at westminster
84-1_695.55_2.306.wav_ASR	so i i it was really nice
84-1_698.38_8.68.wav_ASR	after i graduated from high school i spent some vacation with him and some of my roommates
84-1_707.68_2.16.wav_ASR	he he was someone who was remarried
84-1_710.58_2.476.wav_ASR	he went to harvard law school
84-1_713.273_5.48.wav_ASR	and at the end of his freshman year he went down he one the moon moon compass
84-1_719.733_2.72.wav_ASR	and he went down to the books store
84-1_722.973_3.56.wav_ASR	and he bought all books about italian restaurant history
84-1_726.863_7.22.wav_ASR	so he went back to to campus and he changed
84-1_734.443_1.76.wav_ASR	he was already in the school
84-1_736.563_2.08.wav_ASR	he had been registered at princeton
84-1_739.263_4.24.wav_ASR	and he and he after his first year of waiting the movie he said
84-1_743.663_0.992.wav_ASR	it wasn't for me
84-1_744.8_5.82.wav_ASR	and he went to at harvard he went to a program in italian rhinology rhinology
84-1_756.57_3.48.wav_ASR	yeah it was a good place from
84-1_764.754_4.32.wav_ASR	well i haven't been visiting since my stroke
84-1_769.655_5.279.wav_ASR	but i useta be you know i useta be fairly involved at at the university
84-1_775.834_6.1.wav_ASR	and my youngest my youngest son went there after spending a year in scotland
84-1_782.807_7.94.wav_ASR	and he really really did really well at the school
84-1_790.907_3.04.wav_ASR	so i was very excited for him
84-1_828.61_2.67.wav_ASR	well i happen to know these pictures quite well
84-1_832.07_3.18.wav_ASR	it's a story about a kid playing soccer
84-1_836.05_3.3.wav_ASR	and he he he strikes the ball
84-1_839.99_3.52.wav_ASR	and went through the window of a nearby house
84-1_843.796_24.848.wav_ASR	and landed inside the house where it was taken by one of the young or middle aged husband or maybe husband or just a a regular person who lived in the house
84-1_868.644_20.254.wav_ASR	and then he looked out the window to see if he could figure out who may have hit hit the soccer ball so that it landed it on his not on his lap but close to his lap i think
84-1_907.89_1.94.wav_ASR	the this one i don't know
84-1_909.988_8.342.wav_ASR	it's about a young boy who when he went to school he was deciding whether or not to take an umbrella
84-1_918.59_2.6.wav_ASR	he decided not to take the umbrella
84-1_921.69_2.48.wav_ASR	and it turned out that it it started raining
84-1_924.87_1.88.wav_ASR	so he went back home
84-1_926.94_1.818.wav_ASR	and he was soaking wet
84-1_929.34_2.127.wav_ASR	but apparently he changed his clothes
84-1_932.02_5.76.wav_ASR	and he went back outside with a umbrella so that he could get to school
84-1_938.24_6.041.wav_ASR	but i assume he went to school on time but i really don't know whether that's part of the story or not
84-1_957.58_7.15.wav_ASR	so this is a little girl maybe under ten who had a cat who was stuck up in the tree
84-1_965.45_7.58.wav_ASR	so apparently the the dad got off his ladder
84-1_973.283_3.967.wav_ASR	the girl was a tricycle
84-1_977.59_1.904.wav_ASR	and he stopped and looked at the cat
84-1_979.94_19.956.wav_ASR	so the cat went up to get the the the the cat went the the father went up to get the cat
84-1_999.896_13.754.wav_ASR	and i guess the ladder got kicked away so that the husband was stuck up there with the cat
84-1_1014.556_2.6.wav_ASR	and the the dog started barking
84-1_1017.78_2.68.wav_ASR	and eventually the fire department came
84-1_1021.24_0.94.wav_ASR	and they were able
84-1_1022.44_0.5.wav_ASR	preschool
84-1_1023.32_0.654.wav_ASR	don't know
84-1_1024.06_3.563.wav_ASR	and i think they were able to get the cat and get the man down
84-1_1188.54_7.06.wav_ASR	so this is a story about a young woman named cinderella
84-1_1196.189_19.982.wav_ASR	and she was working at a a middle aged lady and two people who had grown up with her and was interested in trying to get someone to marry them
84-1_1216.59_15.38.wav_ASR	so it turned out that the that there was a young prince who was interested who was living with her with his father
84-1_1232.85_29.52.wav_ASR	and the young prince decided that they should get together and have a ball so that maybe the people of the community the girls were positively interested and in having a reception with the prince
84-1_1263.48_2.52.wav_ASR	four i don't remember the name of the princess
84-1_1266.09_4.89.wav_ASR	but so they sent her out an invitation to all the people in the community
84-1_1272.04_9.98.wav_ASR	and the two young ladies who lived with her who lived with her
84-1_1284.38_8.84.wav_ASR	her older mother decided that they would go to the ball and started getting dressed to go to the ball
84-1_1293.98_17.52.wav_ASR	but cinderella who was a caretaker on the property and was stuck doing things like washing clothes and cleaning the floor and stuff like that she found out about there being this
84-1_1312.413_4.54.wav_ASR	and she wanted to know if there was some way she could attend
84-1_1317.593_1.78.wav_ASR	so she
84-1_1320.333_2.28.wav_ASR	don't remember exactly how it happened
84-1_1323.133_6.02.wav_ASR	and she was able to get in touch with somebody i think they called the fairy godmother
84-1_1330.065_3.52.wav_ASR	and she talked to the fairy godmother
84-1_1334.45_20.985.wav_ASR	and so while the two people from the from the house were going with her her older lady to the dance she decided that she could go
84-1_1355.435_4.2.wav_ASR	so she got dressed up and in fancy clothes
84-1_1360.415_5.337.wav_ASR	and she was told by the fairy godmother that she could go to the ball
84-1_1365.795_1.72.wav_ASR	but she had only one recall
84-1_1368.295_2.94.wav_ASR	and that is that she would be back by midnight
84-1_1371.407_11.811.wav_ASR	so she went to the ball and fell in love with the prince and was having a good time with the prince
84-1_1383.218_12.28.wav_ASR	but when the clock struck struck midnight cinderella knew that she hadta get out of there
84-1_1396.098_5.08.wav_ASR	so she raced for the door and down the steps and into the carriage
84-1_1401.35_2.26.wav_ASR	but soon the carriage
84-1_1404.69_9.9.wav_ASR	and she was by herself with i think some young people who may have been like rabbits and other members of the community
84-1_1415.23_19.09.wav_ASR	so she she she found out that the young princess who had disappeared disappeared at midnight
84-1_1434.84_11.51.wav_ASR	and he sent out a i guess some sort of plea or something that if the person was around she should please contact him
84-1_1446.76_12.16.wav_ASR	and when that didn't happen then a young man went around the village to see if by chance anybody knew anything about this young girl
84-1_1459.92_3.1.wav_ASR	and when she went to the house that had the two
84-1_1463.595_2.1.wav_ASR	and i guess you might now call them spooks
84-1_1468.04_9.89.wav_ASR	and she i think somehow got a hold of cinderella who may be washing clothes in the basement or something
84-1_1478.88_7.897.wav_ASR	and when she was brought upstairs the one shoe that had been left behind she tried on that one shoe
84-1_1486.777_13.623.wav_ASR	and it fit her so that it she knew that the young prince was going to continue to like this young lady
84-1_1501.077_2.06.wav_ASR	and so i guess they got back together
84-1_1503.537_1.94.wav_ASR	and eventually they got married
84-1_1550.75_3.76.wav_ASR	never really had a lot of experiences with clock
84-1_1555.47_3.2.wav_ASR	pretty much always on time
84-1_1559.37_10.68.wav_ASR	and when i was growing up particularly when i was in high school there for some reason was no real time limit on what time i hadta get home
84-1_1570.61_8.74.wav_ASR	so you know i went to a lot of parties on friday night and saturday night and could come home when i wanted
84-1_1579.38_20.6.wav_ASR	and i think it was in a large part because my two social worker parents decided that you know he that the two of them really hadta teach me how to be comfortable with myself and then to be able to know when i was out too late
84-1_1600.084_3.495.wav_ASR	so i mean there were a few times when i was out too late
84-1_1604.124_2.309.wav_ASR	nothing really ever happened to me
84-1_1606.924_3.866.wav_ASR	and then when i went to college i would come home during the summer to
84-1_1611.804_6.56.wav_ASR	and i remember that i was involved with the couple young ladies
84-1_1618.528_4.623.wav_ASR	but i would go out with them but i couldn't get home whenever i wanted to
84-1_1623.52_6.58.wav_ASR	and i remember one summer i had a job that required me to be at work at six o'clock in the morning
84-1_1630.928_3.42.wav_ASR	so sometimes during the summer i would stay at all night and then go to work
84-1_1645.61_7.485.wav_ASR	well so i worked a lot particularly when i had i was i turned out to be
84-1_1653.47_2.186.wav_ASR	think i may have told you this
84-1_1655.73_0.463.wav_ASR	and i sure
84-1_1656.193_3.42.wav_ASR	but i worked for a french company for
84-1_1660.878_8.049.wav_ASR	and i when i had my stroke i started thinking about things i could do
84-1_1668.927_8.2.wav_ASR	because really between vaccinations and between a lot of time i spent particularly with my children
84-1_1678.067_2.92.wav_ASR	they were in a town in new jersey called princeton
84-1_1681.727_2.08.wav_ASR	and they both played a lot of hockey
84-1_1684.367_2.89.wav_ASR	so i never really had a lot of time
84-1_1687.246_2.783.wav_ASR	but one thing i've decided i'm going to do
84-1_1690.506_4.76.wav_ASR	within the past within the next year we're gonna be moving a little further south
84-1_1695.886_3.08.wav_ASR	and i really thought that one thing i could do was bird
84-1_1699.586_2.933.wav_ASR	because i've always had an interest in that
84-1_1702.606_1.984.wav_ASR	but i've never really focused on that
84-1_1705.086_1.62.wav_ASR	and i really thought particularly
84-1_1706.856_2.9.wav_ASR	now i ride a three wheel bicycle
84-1_1709.936_4.506.wav_ASR	and i can't write a a a two wheel bicycle like i useta do
84-1_1714.521_16.081.wav_ASR	so i'm really hoping that when we move i can learn about birds and maybe become someone of an interest in in bird watching because i think that would be a good thing for me to do
84-1_1736.76_2.52.wav_ASR	oh so did she live in bloomington
84-1_1760.0_20.64.wav_ASR	well i i guess when i started traveling for this french company when i was mainly responsible for the united states canada and mexico
84-1_1780.938_3.5.wav_ASR	but they quickly figured out that i could speak
84-1_1785.098_1.94.wav_ASR	so the lawyers were in france
84-1_1787.898_2.948.wav_ASR	and i was one of the few lawyers outside of france
84-1_1791.078_1.06.wav_ASR	it was in the united states
84-1_1793.658_4.48.wav_ASR	oh they useta send me to very place
84-1_1798.398_5.96.wav_ASR	and i remember that i stayed in a real nice hotel in
84-1_1805.978_2.42.wav_ASR	and i also stayed in a nice hotel
84-1_1809.158_3.84.wav_ASR	and i was in a nice hotel when i went to china
84-1_1813.177_5.8.wav_ASR	and i also was in a nice hotel when i was in
84-1_1822.457_6.54.wav_ASR	so i i and during one of the times i was there and it was the fourth of
84-1_1829.537_3.16.wav_ASR	so i remember that the staff brought me a little cake
84-1_1833.15_7.12.wav_ASR	so i i i don't really need a big hotel although my wife likes them
84-1_1841.05_10.3.wav_ASR	oh i i always thought i was in places that i could be comfortable even when even when
84-1_1851.626_2.28.wav_ASR	even i i do remember standing in one hospital
84-1_1854.01_5.896.wav_ASR	it wasn't bernham alabama for part of a case that was pending
84-1_1860.446_2.235.wav_ASR	and we stayed in a god offer the hotel
84-1_1862.726_3.066.wav_ASR	even even that turned out to be good for me
84-1_1865.941_11.7.wav_ASR	so it was a good way for me to learn about the way different hotels can treat me differently
84-1_1878.421_3.38.wav_ASR	well i i was in a hotel in a bad part of town at burerville
84-1_1882.0_1.381.wav_ASR	remember that pretty well
84-1_1897.088_7.408.wav_ASR	well when i was in college there was a prince
84-1_1904.816_0.654.wav_ASR	and i told you
84-1_1905.47_0.58.wav_ASR	the program
84-1_1906.59_6.9.wav_ASR	and over the he was there for about about thirty thirty five years
84-1_1913.91_2.92.wav_ASR	and in nineteen ninety nine he died
84-1_1917.85_5.54.wav_ASR	but before that time he and a group of people
84-1_1923.607_16.1.wav_ASR	there was one person from the class of sixty five one person from the class is sixty two a couple people and then a person from the class of eighty
84-1_1939.914_5.6.wav_ASR	the three of us the six five of us became very good friends
84-1_1945.874_9.776.wav_ASR	and every year because firstnamew did not really have any friends
84-1_1955.75_8.1.wav_ASR	he had a child who died when when he was i think maybe six or seven years old
84-1_1964.11_8.96.wav_ASR	and and so one thing he useta do once a quarter from connecticut he useta go down to new york
84-1_1973.501_5.94.wav_ASR	and we stayed in for my graduation
84-1_1979.861_3.68.wav_ASR	and i went for every year there after for about twenty five years
84-1_1983.921_5.12.wav_ASR	well i went to a place that's no longer in existence but it's called luxton
84-1_1989.678_3.6.wav_ASR	and it was a very nice
84-1_1994.718_3.712.wav_ASR	and we just had a wonderful time every year i was there
84-1_1998.43_14.51.wav_ASR	so i really think back upon that a lot and remember just how much fun i had with these people and how much much i still keep in contact with them
84-1_2012.94_5.74.wav_ASR	and so these these people are some very well known people
84-1_2019.2_6.8.wav_ASR	and so i already had one of the wives has already died
84-1_2026.88_4.22.wav_ASR	he was the head of this thing called the the
84-1_2031.651_17.0.wav_ASR	it's a big it they work for a family
84-1_2048.851_0.828.wav_ASR	and i forgot the name
84-1_2049.811_1.4.wav_ASR	they have a huge truck
84-1_2051.568_3.28.wav_ASR	and so he's gonna retire and move back to new york
84-1_2055.648_10.086.wav_ASR	so i'm very excited that at the end of september i'm gonna be meeting with them and and these people who go back to the class is sixty two
84-1_2066.128_2.086.wav_ASR	so i'm i'm looking forward to it
84-1_2068.397_8.98.wav_ASR	and i i some days i i kinda wish i would be in a little better strength than i am now
84-1_2077.677_3.26.wav_ASR	they all know i had a stroke
84-1_2081.677_3.36.wav_ASR	and i i'm really looking forward
84-1_2085.17_5.06.wav_ASR	most days i think that maybe i shouldn't go because i'm not far enough along
84-1_2090.73_1.56.wav_ASR	but it's it
84-1_2093.19_1.8.wav_ASR	can't remember what we were talking about
84-1_2100.86_4.44.wav_ASR	so so we went to this very nice restaurant
84-1_2105.464_2.296.wav_ASR	we did it for about twenty or twenty five years
84-1_2108.22_5.907.wav_ASR	and it was a good place for me and for the other people that were in the group
84-1_2114.08_11.39.wav_ASR	we useta do it every year in december because it was near the time when one of our favorite people from the class of sixty two had a birth
84-1_2132.16_4.04.wav_ASR	it was a french restaurant called loch
84-1_2137.66_14.62.wav_ASR	well it's if you go back to the nineteen seventies and eighties and look up the restaurant it's a two fifty nine west two fifty nine east i think fifty nine
84-1_2152.28_7.02.wav_ASR	you it's in a nice old building that has three or four floors
84-1_2159.56_1.7.wav_ASR	and it was exquisite
84-1_2161.495_22.32.wav_ASR	and because willy would go there on three or four times throughout the year they knew he knew the staff really really well so that when we came in for the birthday party it was just fantastic
84-1_2184.085_1.14.wav_ASR	it was really nice
84-1_2189.53_1.988.wav_ASR	it's not there anymore yes
84-1_2191.525_0.84.wav_ASR	it was so
84-1_2192.725_1.984.wav_ASR	there was an an owner and his wife
84-1_2195.385_3.86.wav_ASR	and i think they eventually you know was
84-1_2199.985_8.94.wav_ASR	and they sold the restaurant to a guy who was i think from either France or germany
84-1_2210.365_2.624.wav_ASR	and he did not do a very good job
84-1_2212.939_7.3.wav_ASR	so it i would say after three or four years it it it didn't exist anymore
84-1_2224.89_2.489.wav_ASR	now we're we're so we're going to
84-1_2228.519_2.26.wav_ASR	so the fellow who it was
84-1_2231.118_5.52.wav_ASR	and i could wish i could remember the name of the place that he was involved in miami
84-1_2237.538_4.0.wav_ASR	but he has one son who's got three wonderful children
84-1_2242.058_2.84.wav_ASR	and they live in in north germany
84-1_2245.216_14.64.wav_ASR	so my my friend who's now widowed is has fixed up a place i think in the fifty or sixty's in new york
84-1_2260.677_6.594.wav_ASR	so i know that's where the party's gonna be because the apartment is apparently finished now
84-1_2267.297_1.81.wav_ASR	he's been working out a couple years
84-1_2290.78_3.59.wav_ASR	oh interesting enough i had one for lunch
84-1_2296.1_4.56.wav_ASR	yeah i like it once in a while
84-1_2300.734_16.34.wav_ASR	one of the people who was part of the group from lux is a fellow from the class of sixty five or sixty six
84-1_2317.101_4.2.wav_ASR	and he has a peanut butter and jelly sandwich every day for lunch
84-1_2321.761_2.78.wav_ASR	well what you do is you take two pieces of bread
84-1_2325.321_9.159.wav_ASR	and i have my bread in the freezer because i only use a certain amount of it every day
84-1_2335.061_1.789.wav_ASR	so i take the pieces of bread out
84-1_2336.89_7.96.wav_ASR	or i i they come to room people
84-1_2347.07_2.92.wav_ASR	then i have a special peanut butter that i use
84-1_2350.01_1.08.wav_ASR	we're been to korea
84-1_2353.6_1.85.wav_ASR	well the peanut butter there is natural
84-1_2356.05_2.9.wav_ASR	so that's the peanut butter i buy
84-1_2359.35_3.68.wav_ASR	and i would we have a church of that around
84-1_2363.63_3.48.wav_ASR	so i would open the jar and take some peanut butter
84-1_2367.83_2.504.wav_ASR	and then i would take different kinds of jelly
84-1_2370.434_9.058.wav_ASR	but right now i'm on a kick where i have it's like blue blue strawberry and raspberry together in a mix
84-1_2380.014_1.86.wav_ASR	and i put that on the sandwich
84-1_2382.514_2.34.wav_ASR	then i close the sandwich
84-1_2385.454_3.553.wav_ASR	and you can either cut it in half or leave it whole
84-1_2389.007_2.9.wav_ASR	and for some stupid reason i always leave at home
84-1_2392.387_1.62.wav_ASR	and i had what was a nice sandwich
84-1_2394.347_5.34.wav_ASR	so i had that about one thirty as i was preparing for my two o'clock call
84-1_2413.71_5.31.wav_ASR	well firstnamew is something i still try to do but i think my wife probably does more of it
84-1_2420.092_4.906.wav_ASR	oh i would choose what kind of temperature i would want it
84-1_2424.998_6.36.wav_ASR	but typically i would choose cold water because most of the stuff i need to watch is cold water
84-1_2431.958_3.042.wav_ASR	so i would in the special we have a machine
84-1_2435.278_2.14.wav_ASR	well we live in the part
84-1_2437.656_7.8.wav_ASR	and we live in an area that useta be that was where we hafta buy the condo
84-1_2446.076_9.42.wav_ASR	but because we're getting ready to move next year we've sold our condominium and we moved into a rental unit in the same building
84-1_2455.617_4.36.wav_ASR	so we would get the water out
84-1_2461.32_13.017.wav_ASR	we were once the water's set it it comes out on the side
84-1_2474.39_1.33.wav_ASR	so there's nothing on the top
84-1_2476.55_1.89.wav_ASR	oh we hafta load the washer
84-1_2479.39_8.06.wav_ASR	and then we put the the laundry detergent in it and started it
84-1_2487.48_6.74.wav_ASR	and you can see it from the
84-1_2495.135_8.325.wav_ASR	it's not something that it's something that is easily to see from the floor
84-1_2504.52_2.52.wav_ASR	and so we put it on first
84-1_2507.302_4.58.wav_ASR	and it usually lasts for some reason for an hour and five minutes
84-1_2512.062_3.808.wav_ASR	but after an hour and five minutes the wash is done
84-1_2515.962_6.0.wav_ASR	and if we have particular clothes that need to be put on a line we would typically put it on the line
84-1_2522.162_4.18.wav_ASR	and the rest of it would go into the dryer where it would dry
84-1_2526.352_8.24.wav_ASR	and then it would be ready to be folded and put in the cup of drawers that we use for for laundry
84-1_2535.332_2.932.wav_ASR	my wife has quite a few more than i do
84-1_2538.264_8.158.wav_ASR	but it's a place where we can put our stuff and use it as we need too
84-1_2557.42_3.87.wav_ASR	well you hafta understand that now i have it takes me a while
84-1_2562.42_5.82.wav_ASR	so i usually get up in the morning
84-1_2568.47_8.6.wav_ASR	and i will put on my underwear
84-1_2578.86_3.09.wav_ASR	and then i would put on my
84-1_2583.37_2.06.wav_ASR	and i would put on my socks
84-1_2586.38_6.68.wav_ASR	and then i would lie in bed for a little bit and do some exercise because exercise is a very important to me
84-1_2593.52_9.62.wav_ASR	especially even though i'm nearly more than three years out it's still important for me to to get some exercise in every day
84-1_2603.74_0.96.wav_ASR	so i do that
84-1_2604.776_5.64.wav_ASR	and then i will typically once that is done i'll turn on the tv
84-1_2610.876_6.2.wav_ASR	and i'll get dressed the rest of my way which includes you know my side
84-1_2617.536_4.7.wav_ASR	and you haven't seen this but i wear a brace on my right foot
84-1_2622.416_1.873.wav_ASR	so i put that on as well
84-1_2624.77_4.28.wav_ASR	and i i start my day
84-2_12.09_1.1.wav_ASR	my favorite holiday
84-2_13.79_9.28.wav_ASR	it's easily thankful because i have a very small family but usually the family comes as well as my two sons
84-2_24.03_1.468.wav_ASR	and now one of them's married
84-2_25.77_2.32.wav_ASR	and the other's gonna be married pretty soon
84-2_28.25_4.26.wav_ASR	so i look forward to a table with a few more people
84-2_32.564_2.32.wav_ASR	well i have two sisters
84-2_35.624_2.44.wav_ASR	one of them who lives i think i told you in new york
84-2_38.244_1.46.wav_ASR	one of them who lives in chicago
84-2_40.424_2.76.wav_ASR	so they typically come
84-2_43.573_14.028.wav_ASR	and for many many years i had my stroke i was in charge of the cooking of the turkey which i do on a grill
84-2_58.053_1.58.wav_ASR	so it's really really nice
84-2_60.413_2.52.wav_ASR	now i don't do it on the grill anymore
84-2_63.47_4.5.wav_ASR	and we useta have a place at the shore but we don't have that anymore
84-2_68.71_4.28.wav_ASR	so i somebody else cooks it in the oven
84-2_78.94_7.65.wav_ASR	well i've been the host for thanksgiving since my mother died in nineteen ninety ninety
84-2_86.96_1.04.wav_ASR	so it's been awhile
84-2_92.66_0.372.wav_ASR	it is
84-2_93.22_2.6.wav_ASR	it's nice but it doesn't last for very long
84-2_100.512_2.1.wav_ASR	we celebrate firstnameh
84-2_103.112_6.44.wav_ASR	and so we we typically we don't even give presents anymore
84-2_109.668_11.36.wav_ASR	unfortunately both of the young ladies that my two sons married are both not
84-2_121.788_3.708.wav_ASR	one of them i think has no relation which is fine with me
84-2_125.777_3.18.wav_ASR	and one of them i think is basically
84-2_130.297_4.6.wav_ASR	but i think she likes celebrating holidays as well
84-2_154.92_3.84.wav_ASR	my speech is probably the thing that i'm working on the most
84-2_159.16_7.84.wav_ASR	as you know i useta be a lawyer and i've just gone back on active duty
84-2_167.46_3.07.wav_ASR	so i can still be a lawyer if i wanna be a lawyer
84-2_171.22_15.68.wav_ASR	but i i feel that a lot of times especially with small words and pronouns and with his and her and left and right i'm not great with them
84-2_187.36_3.34.wav_ASR	so that that like i hafta think for awhile
84-2_190.722_2.64.wav_ASR	especially now that firstnamel does movies
84-2_193.622_1.4.wav_ASR	more or less it's all the driving
84-2_195.302_2.954.wav_ASR	and i hafta remember which is left and which is right
84-2_198.782_1.54.wav_ASR	that confuses me sometimes
84-2_200.742_3.33.wav_ASR	and i'm i'm pretty good about backwards and forward
84-2_204.582_2.796.wav_ASR	and i'm hoping that i'll be able to drive at some point
84-2_207.378_8.784.wav_ASR	well not that i really wanna drive because i've always been particular interested in driving
84-2_216.44_9.7.wav_ASR	well i just do it because my wife sits in the other seat and my my two kids when they were around sometimes they would also sit in the
84-2_227.22_6.2.wav_ASR	but but now since my stroke my wife does all the driving
84-2_234.05_6.33.wav_ASR	and as i say i think maybe in a year or so i may be able to start driving again
84-2_240.74_0.76.wav_ASR	and i'm i'm not sure
84-2_247.16_2.58.wav_ASR	don't tell my wife that yes it's true
84-2_257.54_0.74.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
84-2_263.0_2.98.wav_ASR	oh yeah i remember my stroke pretty well
84-2_273.18_11.211.wav_ASR	well i was in the hospital for about eight days before i went to the rehab program which is also connected to tomse Jefferson hospital
84-2_285.39_20.682.wav_ASR	and that's where in my area of town which is near richmond house square we go down instead of going up to penn which is probably about the same
84-2_306.65_15.44.wav_ASR	and i remember you know i think i told you that on sunday morning i went out because there was a riot the night before from the guy up in minnesota
84-2_322.53_1.5.wav_ASR	if i forget his name right now
84-2_324.03_2.88.wav_ASR	well so there's a huge right
84-2_327.03_2.723.wav_ASR	we had a building actually burned here
84-2_330.29_4.617.wav_ASR	and i went out at about six o'clock in the morning to start cleaning up
84-2_335.07_2.209.wav_ASR	and i was one of the few people out there
84-2_337.63_2.1.wav_ASR	and i remember they're being a type of clean up
84-2_339.843_5.105.wav_ASR	and so i was there from about six to nine o'clock in the morning
84-2_345.103_1.957.wav_ASR	and then i went to get a news paper
84-2_347.387_0.994.wav_ASR	it didn't feel great
84-2_348.683_2.769.wav_ASR	so a light light laid down for a little bit
84-2_351.763_2.48.wav_ASR	and then i went to work in the afternoon
84-2_354.303_6.287.wav_ASR	and by the evening i was starting to feel a little worse but not terribly worse
84-2_361.05_2.15.wav_ASR	and i went to bed around ten thirty
84-2_364.003_2.577.wav_ASR	and i had my stroke in the middle of the night
84-2_367.183_3.063.wav_ASR	and in the morning my wife could not get a hold of me
84-2_370.723_2.645.wav_ASR	so we have a cosier who came up and found me
84-2_373.648_1.7.wav_ASR	and they took me to the hospital
84-2_375.668_2.58.wav_ASR	that's when i spent about eight days in the hospital
84-2_378.928_4.34.wav_ASR	because because i was doing covid
84-2_383.468_2.537.wav_ASR	so i really didn't see anybody there
84-2_386.828_5.56.wav_ASR	and it was difficult for me because i feel felt my talking was not great
84-2_392.4_3.057.wav_ASR	and i also it was just difficult for me
84-2_395.58_4.82.wav_ASR	so it was i mean i must have watched tv
84-2_400.74_2.02.wav_ASR	and it i was in a room by myself
84-2_402.991_12.52.wav_ASR	and eventually on a tuesday night about a week and a couple days later i went to firstnamem which is only about six blocks away
84-2_415.551_0.838.wav_ASR	it was pretty close
84-2_416.971_3.157.wav_ASR	and so that's when i stayed for two months
84-2_430.74_2.047.wav_ASR	oh i've done a lot of things to try to get better
84-2_433.0_1.662.wav_ASR	and i don't know if all of them works but
84-2_435.24_3.841.wav_ASR	so i was in the hospital for eight weeks
84-2_439.239_9.64.wav_ASR	and every day except the weekends i had o t and p t
84-2_449.599_1.36.wav_ASR	and then i also had speech
84-2_451.039_1.499.wav_ASR	that was quickly in the morning
84-2_453.139_4.394.wav_ASR	and then in the afternoon i for a while i didn't do anything
84-2_457.533_3.458.wav_ASR	and but then eventually i started going to art
84-2_461.433_4.9.wav_ASR	and i i did some stuff but it wasn't really very good
84-2_467.093_6.865.wav_ASR	and i thought by the time i left there i wasn't so sure i was gonna do it
84-2_474.15_7.18.wav_ASR	so i tried it a little bit more at firstnamem which is where i go for outpatient
84-2_481.83_0.958.wav_ASR	and it wasn't great
84-2_483.11_2.78.wav_ASR	soon they introduced a music program
84-2_486.65_2.184.wav_ASR	and i was always interested in singing
84-2_489.35_2.38.wav_ASR	but i don't sing a lot
84-2_491.79_3.961.wav_ASR	and i'm afraid i don't always sing on key
84-2_496.23_1.816.wav_ASR	oh i thought it might be good
84-2_498.25_2.78.wav_ASR	so i took some singing lessons which i still take
84-2_501.63_4.7.wav_ASR	and then also at temple there's an aphasia program
84-2_506.586_10.4.wav_ASR	and so there's a singing program there which i think i like better because i get real songs instead of made up songs at movie
84-2_517.118_19.5.wav_ASR	and i also on something called impact where we try to do stuff to help people learn about aphasia and see see how we can help other people who have aphasia
84-2_563.78_6.71.wav_ASR	well i have a lot of good experiences because i've had a pretty positive life
84-2_570.49_11.14.wav_ASR	and i spent up until first grade i went to school in a suburb of Cleveland Cleveland of Cleveland called south high school
84-2_582.166_13.72.wav_ASR	and then between my first and second grade years i moved to chicago and was in a really nice suburb there called wenford
84-2_596.144_6.909.wav_ASR	and so growing up i i i was participating in a lot of different things
84-2_603.184_3.92.wav_ASR	it was not a great athlete but i was an okay enough athlete
84-2_607.264_4.74.wav_ASR	so i usually make the last player on the team
84-2_612.29_4.45.wav_ASR	and i really like playing hockey which we did outdoors at the time
84-2_617.81_12.14.wav_ASR	and so i would say i learned a lot of experience from hockey just just about the game and about you know how to set up different plays
84-2_630.86_17.583.wav_ASR	and eventually eventually when i was in my what's called the baltimore leg which is fourteen and fifteen i was made captain of the team
84-2_648.56_1.971.wav_ASR	that was a really nice hospital for me
84-2_650.531_4.636.wav_ASR	and it was a good time for me
84-2_655.371_2.836.wav_ASR	my my i was on the b t i was not on the e t
84-2_658.411_5.549.wav_ASR	but but there's enough players on the bdt that i was pretty friendly with
84-2_664.191_1.68.wav_ASR	and all of them were from montreal
84-2_666.031_2.66.wav_ASR	so it was in north carolina
84-2_668.951_1.04.wav_ASR	it's a neurosurgeon
84-2_670.145_2.671.wav_ASR	so it was really nice to meet all the people
84-2_673.365_10.54.wav_ASR	and we would have games basically from lake forest and from lake county to cook
84-2_684.865_2.36.wav_ASR	so it was just nice to get to know some people
84-2_693.81_2.2.wav_ASR	and i did get hurt by the accident
84-2_696.361_5.44.wav_ASR	and i broke my collar but
84-2_706.07_1.072.wav_ASR	it wasn't that bad
84-2_710.85_1.037.wav_ASR	it it can be
84-2_712.13_2.397.wav_ASR	but it wasn't bad for them
84-2_714.67_2.22.wav_ASR	maybe it wasn't a particularly bad
84-2_717.63_4.6.wav_ASR	but i remember i came home and i still wasn't feeling great
84-2_722.231_11.86.wav_ASR	so my dad took me to what was then called evanston hospital which is now part of northwestern medical center from downtown
84-2_735.0_4.82.wav_ASR	and so i remember i did some exercises and some other things
84-2_740.071_1.66.wav_ASR	and they said i had a broken collar
84-2_741.98_7.66.wav_ASR	so i i think you know i i i think i i actually broke my color bone
84-2_751.48_1.24.wav_ASR	maybe it was only once
84-2_753.1_1.699.wav_ASR	and then i also broke my wrist
84-2_755.56_1.969.wav_ASR	well i can't remember exactly how he did that
84-2_765.892_4.149.wav_ASR	yeah you you can't have a cast on that
84-2_776.028_1.013.wav_ASR	the the end
84-2_777.152_1.08.wav_ASR	you lay in port or something
84-2_781.243_1.08.wav_ASR	oh well
84-2_785.063_2.76.wav_ASR	so did did you do that in college too
84-2_797.763_0.72.wav_ASR	oh good
84-2_845.89_2.26.wav_ASR	oh yes that's the same thing we saw last
84-2_858.01_2.94.wav_ASR	so it's the story of a young man
84-2_861.0_5.48.wav_ASR	he's around twelve years old kicking a soccer ball
84-2_867.26_13.14.wav_ASR	and i guess one of the iron kicks went through a plate glass window and landed next to someone who was probably either reading or maybe watching tv
84-2_880.69_3.33.wav_ASR	and so he saw the ball coming at him
84-2_884.43_10.34.wav_ASR	and he noticed that a lamp had come to rest beside him
84-2_895.09_3.248.wav_ASR	and i could see the ball coming at him
84-2_898.338_2.865.wav_ASR	so he might have caught the ball
84-2_902.03_2.001.wav_ASR	and he wasn't sure what to do
84-2_904.138_2.02.wav_ASR	so he saw that the glass was broken
84-2_906.678_4.26.wav_ASR	so we went over to the window to see what had happened
84-2_911.418_4.592.wav_ASR	and i'm assuming that he saw the person who kicked the soccer ball
84-2_916.01_6.4.wav_ASR	but but then perhaps but by then perhaps the person with the soccer ball had run away
84-2_930.177_7.24.wav_ASR	so it's the story of a young boy who was on his way to school
84-2_938.237_5.22.wav_ASR	and he wasn't sure that he needed an umbrella
84-2_943.61_7.119.wav_ASR	so he decided that he wouldn't take an umbrella because it maybe didn't look like it was gonna rain
84-2_951.25_5.94.wav_ASR	but as soon as she stepped outside and started walking a little bit the rain came down
84-2_957.89_1.84.wav_ASR	so he went back to his house
84-2_959.73_4.444.wav_ASR	and i he was all wet
84-2_964.39_3.26.wav_ASR	and his mother had a stern look on her face
84-2_967.95_1.755.wav_ASR	but there was nothing he could do
84-2_969.89_4.927.wav_ASR	so he got some new clothes and went back out into the rain
84-2_975.35_1.92.wav_ASR	but this time he had an umbrella
84-2_988.79_6.25.wav_ASR	this is the picture of a young lady who had a cat stuck up in a tree
84-2_995.279_8.66.wav_ASR	so he she got off his tricycle and saw i think what must have been his dad
84-2_1004.61_2.312.wav_ASR	his dad climbed up the tree
84-2_1007.139_3.56.wav_ASR	and then the ladder broke and fell to the ground
84-2_1011.04_7.14.wav_ASR	there is a a puppy who's trying to see if maybe the man or could come down
84-2_1018.34_18.709.wav_ASR	but he was up there and needed to be rescued by the fire department who came over and was going to get the cat down
84-2_1188.82_0.522.wav_ASR	got you
84-2_1190.29_11.04.wav_ASR	well so this is a story about cinderella and her two stepdaughters and her old
84-2_1202.87_5.93.wav_ASR	so i believe that cinderella needed some help
84-2_1208.85_10.08.wav_ASR	and since she was on her own she was able to get a job with the two stepsisters and the stepmother
84-2_1219.6_12.86.wav_ASR	and she was doing a lot of stuff like washing the clothes and cleaning the cleaning the floors and doing stuff like that and probably also doing the laundry
84-2_1233.61_13.66.wav_ASR	then it came to pass that there was a prince who lived in the castle with his father and mother and perhaps some sisters and brothers
84-2_1247.87_7.51.wav_ASR	and he he was looking for somebody to fall in love with
84-2_1255.91_10.09.wav_ASR	so everybody in the town got an invitation to this big party that they were gonna have
84-2_1266.0_7.976.wav_ASR	so the two stepsisters dressed up in fine clothes and the mother went with them
84-2_1273.976_12.38.wav_ASR	and they went to the the prince the king was looking for her
84-2_1286.996_3.0.wav_ASR	and so he he decided to have this party
84-2_1290.119_5.02.wav_ASR	and so they were at the party
84-2_1295.299_12.78.wav_ASR	and then a fairy godmother came along and said to the young woman cinderella that cinderella should go to the party too
84-2_1308.226_9.88.wav_ASR	so she she was able to get a dress and some nice clothing including a some beautiful shoes
84-2_1319.006_8.0.wav_ASR	and they were somehow invited to the wedding
84-2_1327.231_10.9.wav_ASR	and they came to the wedding and a special charity which had a rider and i think of someone who was in the back
84-2_1338.211_7.36.wav_ASR	and they came out at the party
84-2_1345.673_6.279.wav_ASR	and the the prince was there
84-2_1352.133_2.54.wav_ASR	and the prince saw cinderella
84-2_1355.293_3.02.wav_ASR	and they had a very good time
84-2_1358.335_10.88.wav_ASR	but the cinderella had been told that she needed to be home by midnight
84-2_1370.035_5.014.wav_ASR	so as the clock struck twelve she knew she hadta get out
84-2_1375.049_3.707.wav_ASR	so he left and left the prince there
84-2_1378.756_17.48.wav_ASR	and as he went out to the carriage the princess cinderella turned back into a a servant
84-2_1396.299_11.02.wav_ASR	they and the prince prince was really upset about what had happened
84-2_1407.593_17.28.wav_ASR	so he he sent some people from his castle to go out and see if find
84-2_1425.678_6.62.wav_ASR	and so he went to different houses and could not find anybody
84-2_1432.618_11.82.wav_ASR	when he went to the house where the two stepsisters live she was wanting to know if anybody else was there
84-2_1444.93_13.02.wav_ASR	and somehow i think maybe he he figured out that that young lady who was cinderella was in the other room
84-2_1458.25_1.72.wav_ASR	so he brought out cinderella
84-2_1460.57_2.92.wav_ASR	and the shoes fit
84-2_1463.42_8.56.wav_ASR	so he went back to the prince and told him about this person
84-2_1472.66_6.16.wav_ASR	and eventually the person became close again with the prince
84-2_1480.57_3.74.wav_ASR	and and in the end the prince and cinderella got married
84-2_1514.01_3.94.wav_ASR	but i don't remember what i talked about last week
84-2_1518.63_6.689.wav_ASR	so there was always a clock in my house growing up
84-2_1526.11_3.865.wav_ASR	and so i i knew pretty easily what time it was
84-2_1530.23_1.698.wav_ASR	oh i think i know the story
84-2_1531.9_8.72.wav_ASR	and so i remember especially in high school that there wasn't really any time i hadta be home
84-2_1541.12_5.3.wav_ASR	so my parents said that you know whenever you get home is fine
84-2_1546.84_4.825.wav_ASR	you know obviously not too late but you you wanna have a good time
84-2_1551.665_5.02.wav_ASR	so especially on friday and saturday nights we useta go out
84-2_1556.735_4.043.wav_ASR	you useta drink beer in one of my friends' basement and then go out
84-2_1561.105_4.17.wav_ASR	and so we would go to different parties which was a lot of fun
84-2_1565.275_7.34.wav_ASR	but i always made it home except one time i actually fell asleep at the wheel
84-2_1573.075_7.54.wav_ASR	but i was driving
84-2_1580.922_5.48.wav_ASR	and somebody else named one of my friends who was named firstnamet was in the other
84-2_1587.065_3.064.wav_ASR	and he he yelled at me
84-2_1590.202_0.83.wav_ASR	and i woke up
84-2_1591.802_1.28.wav_ASR	and it was in a stop
84-2_1593.302_0.94.wav_ASR	so nothing happened
84-2_1594.562_1.16.wav_ASR	and i was pretty lucky
84-2_1595.743_6.552.wav_ASR	so i guess it it's just good to know that a clock is always there knowing what time it is
84-2_1602.295_18.18.wav_ASR	and hopefully you know i i i then when i was in college i useta i dated a couple different girls where i was from in in firstnamew firstnamec and and
84-2_1621.213_5.323.wav_ASR	and so i had a job that started at six o'clock in the morning during the summer
84-2_1626.636_8.781.wav_ASR	so i useta stay out with my friends or at my girlfriend's house until about four in the morning and then go go to work
84-2_1635.473_3.123.wav_ASR	or i would come home and get my bike and then go to work
84-2_1638.596_3.3.wav_ASR	so it was fun but it was also pretty exhausting
84-2_1661.747_12.78.wav_ASR	and i think the only thing i can say about birds is that growing up i pretty much took birds for grant
84-2_1674.744_11.46.wav_ASR	and i remember even when i was in undergrad and when i went to college i i mean i never really thought about birds
84-2_1686.85_16.941.wav_ASR	but as i started to get well i i i guess i should say that i worked a lot in when i was a lawyer
84-2_1703.791_4.937.wav_ASR	and then i went to a company where i was for a long time
84-2_1709.271_8.12.wav_ASR	but now that i'm looking for stuff to do one of the things i'm pretty interested in doing is bird birds
84-2_1718.071_2.377.wav_ASR	so it's something i'm gonna try to do
84-2_1720.448_13.26.wav_ASR	and i i'm sure i told you but maybe i didn't that me and my wife are gonna move to south carolina and in the community there where i feel i can do some bird watching
84-2_1734.128_1.611.wav_ASR	so i'd like to try it
84-2_1735.948_1.252.wav_ASR	hope i'm good at it
84-2_1737.348_1.265.wav_ASR	and i know what i'm doing
84-2_1738.613_8.402.wav_ASR	but it's important for me to find some hobbies that i can work on and try to get feel feel good about it
84-2_1751.233_2.428.wav_ASR	oh we've already picked the place
84-2_1753.973_1.755.wav_ASR	long time ago firstnamesk firstnamek firstnamek
84-2_1755.813_0.848.wav_ASR	everybody been there
84-2_1757.804_3.6.wav_ASR	and it's off the coast of
84-2_1763.495_4.149.wav_ASR	about forty minutes from the charlotte airport
84-2_1768.604_1.36.wav_ASR	and it's a beautiful
84-2_1772.244_3.34.wav_ASR	well i don't wanna go into too much detail
84-2_1775.781_12.445.wav_ASR	but we we we are constructing a place there that part of a monument that's right on the beach
84-2_1788.901_5.343.wav_ASR	and so so i my wife is down there right now
84-2_1794.244_5.8.wav_ASR	and so she could actually go into the building which is being constructed
84-2_1800.532_16.3.wav_ASR	and she was able to tell me that from my from firstnamem is place my wife says that she can actually see the beach you know for the ocean
84-2_1817.192_13.006.wav_ASR	so for me that was really nice because i've always my i useta have a place in oxford maryland which my wife really liked that i didn't like so much
84-2_1830.198_1.1.wav_ASR	was laid on the water
84-2_1831.912_4.94.wav_ASR	and so now i feel that i've been able to give something you know
84-2_1837.124_5.433.wav_ASR	some i've wanted to find a place that would be good for her
84-2_1843.004_3.038.wav_ASR	and i mean it's gonna be a little hot for me
84-2_1846.364_6.04.wav_ASR	but i think it's gonna be worth it because it's gonna be a great place for my wife
84-2_1861.804_4.88.wav_ASR	it's in south carolina or north carolina
84-2_1868.964_0.303.wav_ASR	okay
84-2_1877.712_1.04.wav_ASR	well it's pretty certain
84-2_1879.112_1.64.wav_ASR	and i'm not very concerned with so
84-2_1882.912_1.763.wav_ASR	it it i think it should be good
84-2_1885.012_4.164.wav_ASR	and we know some people down there who live there
84-2_1889.212_1.86.wav_ASR	so that's gonna be really helpful too
84-2_1891.217_9.274.wav_ASR	but the person i know really well made a fortune and in a company that he was in
84-2_1900.657_4.7.wav_ASR	so he has a lot of places now all over the world including cuba
84-2_1929.085_7.92.wav_ASR	well probably the hotel i stayed in some nice hotel
84-2_1937.925_5.3.wav_ASR	but probably the nicest hotel i stayed in was for my wedding
84-2_1943.216_11.64.wav_ASR	and i married a law student when i was in college who lived in washington dc
84-2_1955.736_3.62.wav_ASR	so we got married at the four seasons hotel in georgetown
84-2_1960.256_1.29.wav_ASR	and that was a real nice place
84-2_1961.546_2.702.wav_ASR	we we were able to be there for a couple days
84-2_1964.566_2.56.wav_ASR	we had a fair amount of people at our wedding
84-2_1967.137_1.529.wav_ASR	and i think it was about two hundred
84-2_1969.686_5.86.wav_ASR	and we were able to have a wedding on a sunday after
84-2_1976.586_2.56.wav_ASR	and we had a nice lunch
84-2_1979.209_12.504.wav_ASR	and then i remember that many of my friends went down to a bar further down in georgetown and with my wife and some friends and had a nice evening there
84-2_1992.089_1.731.wav_ASR	so for me it was a good place
84-2_1994.369_2.18.wav_ASR	but truly i like being home
84-2_1996.549_3.359.wav_ASR	so i you know i did it
84-2_1999.989_0.545.wav_ASR	it was good
84-2_2000.709_3.348.wav_ASR	you know i like being where i am now
84-2_2196.154_4.351.wav_ASR	well i think i told you about my favorite restaurant in new york right
84-2_2200.505_1.925.wav_ASR	one that i went to for about twenty years
84-2_2204.4_1.8.wav_ASR	oh i won't talk about that
84-2_2206.653_12.64.wav_ASR	well here in philadelphia i've gotten to know a few restaurants
84-2_2219.853_5.936.wav_ASR	because i lived here when i first took a job
84-2_2225.789_3.92.wav_ASR	well i was a law clerk for a judge in philadelphia
84-2_2230.669_3.36.wav_ASR	and then i lived here for awhile before i moved to princeton
84-2_2234.197_14.716.wav_ASR	but one of the places i like to eat a lot although it's gone up in price a little bit is a restaurant called firstnamese which is how you spell firstnamep in french
84-2_2249.537_1.139.wav_ASR	and i told her
84-2_2250.676_4.494.wav_ASR	but i useta be able to speak french pretty well
84-2_2255.756_5.814.wav_ASR	and i like going there because they have a lot of good food
84-2_2262.196_5.2.wav_ASR	most of which is again two it's gotten to be overwhelmed like so many restaurant
84-2_2267.49_9.604.wav_ASR	but one thing i really like there is my my they have a hamburger that's really nice
84-2_2277.79_5.42.wav_ASR	and it can be cooked different ways
84-2_2283.415_9.06.wav_ASR	and i like my meat very very far not cook most of the way
84-2_2293.155_8.88.wav_ASR	and it's a really nice place to get a juice burger and either a salad or some french
84-2_2302.33_4.163.wav_ASR	but the french ride is usually for my wife
84-2_2307.01_2.4.wav_ASR	so i usually wind up getting a cell
84-2_2309.77_7.26.wav_ASR	but sometimes she makes me order the the she makes me order the
84-2_2336.29_0.91.wav_ASR	oh we had this too
84-2_2337.64_6.1.wav_ASR	well the peanut butter and jelly sandwich for me is pretty easy to make
84-2_2344.78_4.14.wav_ASR	my go to the most of my bread is in the freezer
84-2_2349.56_2.46.wav_ASR	so i take out two pieces of bread
84-2_2352.03_13.906.wav_ASR	and i like a particular kind of peanut butter that is made at costa which has nothing but peanuts in it
84-2_2365.936_10.164.wav_ASR	and so i usually put when i have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich which lately has been occurring a little more frequently for some reason i don't know
84-2_2376.676_2.695.wav_ASR	and then i'll take just about any jelly
84-2_2379.371_10.336.wav_ASR	but i've found a jelly at firstnamew that has three different types of food in it
84-2_2389.5_27.09.wav_ASR	and so i put that with some peanut butter on a bread that is a type of wheat bread that i find to be very good
84-2_2416.69_4.042.wav_ASR	so i i'm gonna have a sandwich a little later today
84-2_2420.83_1.92.wav_ASR	and i'm probably gonna have a turkey sandwich
84-2_2423.13_2.155.wav_ASR	but yeah i like peanut butter and jelly a lot
84-2_2425.63_8.46.wav_ASR	and i've got the sandwich down to a size
84-2_2440.382_15.965.wav_ASR	well we i think i may have told you that we useta live in an apartment that we owned across the hall
84-2_2456.416_4.325.wav_ASR	but we found somebody that we thought we could sell it to
84-2_2460.976_7.3.wav_ASR	and it turned out that he the two of them bought it at a price that i think was pretty good
84-2_2468.485_11.2.wav_ASR	so while we're waiting for the place to be built and kiera we've moved it turns out across the hall where there's a rental unit
84-2_2479.5_13.0.wav_ASR	and there's a washer and a dryer with all the with all the
84-2_2493.08_0.68.wav_ASR	the rooms
84-2_2494.18_4.5.wav_ASR	all the locations i guess you could say have a washer in a dryer
84-2_2499.03_7.61.wav_ASR	so usually there may be a couple pieces of cloth that may go to the washer
84-2_2506.81_8.7.wav_ASR	but for the most part i will open the jar
84-2_2516.541_5.6.wav_ASR	it's a washer that works it it applies from the side
84-2_2522.721_4.203.wav_ASR	so i've put all the clothes in which is something i'm still able to do
84-2_2527.541_5.5.wav_ASR	and then i will turn on the washer
84-2_2533.721_1.86.wav_ASR	usually it's on a cold side
84-2_2535.923_4.6.wav_ASR	and once it starts moving a little bit i put in the detergent
84-2_2541.603_5.972.wav_ASR	and for some reason this this washer it takes a long time
84-2_2548.263_2.18.wav_ASR	but in about an hour it's done
84-2_2550.963_2.58.wav_ASR	and the clothes have always come up pretty clean
84-2_2553.677_3.5.wav_ASR	so i then put them in the dryer
84-2_2558.157_3.06.wav_ASR	and that's about another forty five minutes
84-2_2561.777_10.454.wav_ASR	but usually within two hours the clothes come out and they're ready to be folded which for me takes a while because i only have the one end
84-2_2572.231_6.68.wav_ASR	and so what i've tried to do is just limit the stuff that goes in my closet
84-2_2579.691_1.311.wav_ASR	and firstnamel is at her own
84-2_2582.091_6.46.wav_ASR	yeah she she her clothes get washed with mine but i can't really put them away
84-2_2588.911_1.977.wav_ASR	and she's got a lot more clinging than i do
84-2_2605.921_5.7.wav_ASR	well i i grew up with a lot of flowers
84-2_2612.441_6.897.wav_ASR	but somehow when i married firstnamel that was not one of the things that she was really interested in
84-2_2619.338_7.26.wav_ASR	so we have a few not a lot of fakes around our apartment
84-2_2627.098_3.1.wav_ASR	but i had a birthday in march
84-2_2630.778_6.74.wav_ASR	and one of the people i've become very close with is a personal trainer named firstnamej
84-2_2637.618_7.84.wav_ASR	and so firstnamej has been with me for about two and a half years
84-2_2645.678_7.36.wav_ASR	and she got a small plot for me that is the only living part in this apartment
84-2_2654.178_0.9.wav_ASR	and for some reason
84-2_2655.359_3.54.wav_ASR	and i got it at the end of
84-2_2661.499_3.353.wav_ASR	and for some reason the plan is still chucking along
84-2_2664.959_0.989.wav_ASR	it's doing pretty well
84-2_2666.159_8.647.wav_ASR	so i feel good that i can keep a plant now for four months
84-2_2681.403_5.463.wav_ASR	and i think the biggest success is is that i don't hafta water it very often
84-2_2689.146_3.773.wav_ASR	and i can show it to you but i don't know what it is
84-2_2692.919_6.577.wav_ASR	maybe at the end if we have enough time i'll see if i can see it
84-2_2699.679_5.76.wav_ASR	but it's just hard for me to see because it's on the window over there
84-2_2707.71_1.15.wav_ASR	you're big on planning
84-2_2725.24_2.756.wav_ASR	well find the easy ones to start with

63-1_148.618_8.52.wav_ASR	well i i other from you know get get married and i think the one of the best things i ever did
63-1_157.162_5.04.wav_ASR	and it was about the twenties or so
63-1_162.226_11.69.wav_ASR	oh i mean when i was in the airforce i played a lot of ball and a lot of basketball
63-1_174.727_4.44.wav_ASR	and i had a wonderful time doing that
63-1_179.46_1.02.wav_ASR	the wonderful thing
63-1_180.54_1.2.wav_ASR	and i played basketball
63-1_182.282_1.16.wav_ASR	and i played foot ball
63-1_184.226_3.1.wav_ASR	the football was my the same
63-1_187.349_4.87.wav_ASR	and i i i learned a lot
63-1_192.234_2.13.wav_ASR	and i i i got a lot from them
63-1_194.426_2.4.wav_ASR	and it was one of my best things
63-1_215.891_8.0.wav_ASR	he kicked the ball
63-1_224.379_7.11.wav_ASR	he he kick the ball
63-1_231.786_1.23.wav_ASR	it went into the house
63-1_234.185_1.24.wav_ASR	the dad died
63-1_236.68_11.58.wav_ASR	and he won't get it back because of the the ball being out
63-1_249.3_1.41.wav_ASR	you you kick the ball
63-1_251.228_0.85.wav_ASR	it went to the hospital
63-1_252.096_4.14.wav_ASR	knocked over the lamp
63-1_257.216_2.101.wav_ASR	and he's not gonna get it back
63-1_281.525_0.69.wav_ASR	okay
63-1_308.542_0.49.wav_ASR	okay
63-1_309.391_6.76.wav_ASR	the kid didn't wanna use the umbrella
63-1_316.275_1.26.wav_ASR	so he went out without
63-1_318.802_1.81.wav_ASR	and he got stuck in the way
63-1_321.731_2.41.wav_ASR	and so he went back home
63-1_324.164_4.18.wav_ASR	and his mother was really mad at him
63-1_328.364_3.0.wav_ASR	and and so he took the umbrella
63-1_333.482_4.93.wav_ASR	and then he when he got home he gave it to his mother
63-1_360.885_0.43.wav_ASR	okay
63-1_361.333_5.35.wav_ASR	oh do you want me just tell you right now
63-1_371.077_0.39.wav_ASR	okay
63-1_371.488_1.82.wav_ASR	and i'm ready
63-1_373.954_9.02.wav_ASR	there's there's a ladder on the ground
63-1_382.989_5.11.wav_ASR	and and it was useta catch a cat
63-1_388.361_1.55.wav_ASR	but it it was on the
63-1_390.248_1.3.wav_ASR	so i did
63-1_392.33_9.53.wav_ASR	and i needed to take the dog up to the boy so he could get
63-1_402.248_11.88.wav_ASR	but he he wasn't couldn't get up because the dog was growling on
63-1_414.71_2.09.wav_ASR	so i got some fireman
63-1_416.822_3.82.wav_ASR	and and he he got up the tree
63-1_421.431_4.55.wav_ASR	and on his way to the garden he saw rain
63-1_425.998_2.87.wav_ASR	and and
63-1_965.553_24.44.wav_ASR	and cinderella cinderella was introduced by her two sisters and her mother and
63-1_990.015_24.73.wav_ASR	and she she couldn't go to the
63-1_1017.014_15.52.wav_ASR	but but cinderella had a fairy godmother who who got her all dressed up and sent her to the ball
63-1_1032.558_7.14.wav_ASR	and at midnight she
63-1_1043.301_2.52.wav_ASR	and she lost her slipper
63-1_1045.915_8.16.wav_ASR	and so everyone was wondering about it
63-1_1055.11_1.24.wav_ASR	but probably she only had one
63-1_1056.449_6.94.wav_ASR	and then the child came and said he had the other slipper
63-1_1063.516_1.95.wav_ASR	and he he kicked it right
63-1_1065.485_2.85.wav_ASR	and it was her slipper
63-1_1069.277_5.73.wav_ASR	and it's all the cinderella and the prince lived happily ever after
63-1_1076.923_0.77.wav_ASR	so something like that
63-1_1089.922_3.5.wav_ASR	and i get
63-1_1094.826_14.33.wav_ASR	and i'd put jelly on one slice and peanut butter on the other
63-1_1109.178_2.18.wav_ASR	and i put it together now
63-2_8.939_3.81.wav_ASR	my speech is okay
63-2_12.805_5.82.wav_ASR	but a lot of times i i know what it is but i can't say
63-2_20.929_0.67.wav_ASR	that's what it is
63-2_21.647_1.36.wav_ASR	that i know what it
63-2_23.054_4.5.wav_ASR	and until someone tells me what it is i just can't say it
63-2_27.999_0.71.wav_ASR	well i don't know why
63-2_28.733_2.26.wav_ASR	it's the way it is now
63-2_38.859_0.35.wav_ASR	yeah
63-2_44.303_3.08.wav_ASR	well i got up in the morning
63-2_48.081_2.82.wav_ASR	and right away i i i rolled over
63-2_51.772_2.14.wav_ASR	and she she was by my side
63-2_54.63_3.83.wav_ASR	and i told her i felt a little queer
63-2_59.076_3.32.wav_ASR	and she sings sings much about it
63-2_62.957_13.02.wav_ASR	so then i went to the bathroom and i i i went to the bathroom and did my thing
63-2_76.575_5.33.wav_ASR	and then right after i did my thing something happened in here
63-2_83.156_2.36.wav_ASR	and i said
63-2_86.28_0.56.wav_ASR	oh no
63-2_87.247_4.1.wav_ASR	and that's the last thing i remember for weeks
63-2_110.622_8.52.wav_ASR	well the the last thing i knew before my stroke hit was
63-2_119.546_6.29.wav_ASR	well after my stroke quit i i woke up
63-2_125.884_5.95.wav_ASR	and i remember this was an ambulance new york
63-2_131.943_3.96.wav_ASR	so the next thing i know i'm back in wichita
63-2_137.638_4.23.wav_ASR	and i'm on a bed
63-2_141.886_3.02.wav_ASR	my wife there
63-2_145.895_8.26.wav_ASR	and and i i slowly started talking to her
63-2_154.83_6.86.wav_ASR	but i at at the first first thing i don't think i made much sense to her
63-2_161.771_2.36.wav_ASR	but she was always there for me
63-2_166.318_5.94.wav_ASR	so it it it you know it was okay because i i could tell her anything i want
63-2_172.567_0.74.wav_ASR	and she missed
63-2_174.287_2.43.wav_ASR	dead or whatever she could
63-2_179.54_8.31.wav_ASR	and then after awhile two or three nurses would come in every day
63-2_187.899_9.62.wav_ASR	and they would do crazy things like lift my legs and lift my back
63-2_197.735_3.12.wav_ASR	and every day is something different
63-2_200.878_1.4.wav_ASR	and i would go down the hall
63-2_203.68_13.15.wav_ASR	and they would do leg lifts up trying to get me whatever
63-2_216.852_3.61.wav_ASR	and i i would do do stairs
63-2_220.72_2.27.wav_ASR	and i remember that i did stairs
63-2_223.735_6.54.wav_ASR	did a lot of i don't know
63-2_231.307_0.98.wav_ASR	and i don't know
63-2_232.337_1.88.wav_ASR	that we're always somebody there
63-2_234.266_4.36.wav_ASR	and there was always somebody doing something to me
63-2_238.866_2.82.wav_ASR	lot of it i don't know anymore
63-2_241.734_6.07.wav_ASR	but it it was very for the first couple weeks i it was very extensive
63-2_270.707_16.25.wav_ASR	well the the the best thing i can remember before my stroke was getting married of course
63-2_287.802_2.96.wav_ASR	and i was in the service at the time
63-2_290.815_10.36.wav_ASR	we we before my before i was a prison officer i was also in the airforce for twenty two years
63-2_302.963_14.46.wav_ASR	so other from that i think the the thing that i i do the most about is in in helen k grace
63-2_318.711_10.5.wav_ASR	and i i was very interested in basketball and baseball and and especially football
63-2_330.401_3.01.wav_ASR	had a lot of good memories about football
63-2_335.59_16.4.wav_ASR	yeah i'm not not blown my own horn but after the season i was the best player defensively on the team
63-2_352.759_1.93.wav_ASR	at a lot of intersections
63-2_356.795_1.32.wav_ASR	well a lot of things happened
63-2_358.702_5.14.wav_ASR	but there's a a lot of things
63-2_363.887_3.23.wav_ASR	there's there's so much
63-2_367.253_10.28.wav_ASR	you know there's so many things you know good and bad that happened to me
63-2_377.551_2.11.wav_ASR	and i i can't do anything
63-2_379.803_3.54.wav_ASR	so in fact there's a lot of my don't even remember anymore
63-2_384.569_2.54.wav_ASR	they were either travel or whatever
63-2_387.736_1.31.wav_ASR	but that that's the way it
63-2_411.303_0.58.wav_ASR	okay
63-2_413.03_4.45.wav_ASR	there there was a boy who kicked the ball
63-2_417.912_3.64.wav_ASR	and the ball went into a glass window
63-2_422.674_15.1.wav_ASR	and when it went into the window and it hit the guy on the stairs and knocked over the lamp
63-2_438.726_2.45.wav_ASR	and so he he grabbed the lamp
63-2_442.108_7.4.wav_ASR	and he he told him he wasn't getting it back to the lamp was fixed
63-2_481.005_0.36.wav_ASR	okay
63-2_481.732_8.03.wav_ASR	first of all the boy did not want to take an umbrella
63-2_491.361_5.2.wav_ASR	he he he said it was okay that she didn't have it
63-2_497.241_6.7.wav_ASR	so he he he walked out to in the rain and saw it was raining
63-2_504.464_2.37.wav_ASR	so he hadta go back home
63-2_508.083_4.21.wav_ASR	and he was all wet no
63-2_512.317_9.689.wav_ASR	and so she hadta get her umbrella
63-2_522.629_3.17.wav_ASR	and she put it in her hand
63-2_525.853_3.21.wav_ASR	and he went to school
63-2_544.992_0.48.wav_ASR	okay
63-2_557.835_3.71.wav_ASR	the first of all i see a little girl
63-2_561.562_1.48.wav_ASR	and she's trying to get a
63-2_564.448_3.49.wav_ASR	but her her ladder broke
63-2_568.152_0.97.wav_ASR	so she couldn't get
63-2_569.138_10.13.wav_ASR	so she she went to her father father who couldn't get it either because the the ladder was gone
63-2_579.979_9.18.wav_ASR	and he had a dog a dog
63-2_589.176_4.92.wav_ASR	and had a
63-2_594.116_4.12.wav_ASR	up up the tree trying to get
63-2_599.141_4.71.wav_ASR	and so because she couldn't
63-2_603.984_1.24.wav_ASR	and she couldn't get the cat
63-2_606.497_1.25.wav_ASR	couldn't get the dog
63-2_608.377_9.35.wav_ASR	and she went with the firemen who got her out and got everything back to normal
63-2_1440.511_0.74.wav_ASR	okay
63-2_1441.268_16.0.wav_ASR	when the grandmother and her two grandchildren they brought in cinderella to clean up the house
63-2_1458.806_6.78.wav_ASR	and cinderella did all the work
63-2_1466.686_10.03.wav_ASR	and as kids got older there were more things for cinderella to do that they wanted
63-2_1478.756_14.77.wav_ASR	and finally they they got an invitation from the prince that there was gonna be a gal at the prince's palace
63-2_1495.182_6.21.wav_ASR	and they they told her she couldn't go because she wasn't invited
63-2_1501.414_1.13.wav_ASR	and the only lady was
63-2_1503.72_13.93.wav_ASR	so after they were gone the fairy godmother showed up and and showed them how she could do it
63-2_1518.63_15.49.wav_ASR	and so the fairy godmother did turn all the mice and everything into into the carriage and the horse and all
63-2_1535.312_12.67.wav_ASR	and then cinderella was given a fine dress to wear
63-2_1549.523_20.5.wav_ASR	and then when she got to the ball the only thing when she got to the ball the prince could see nothing but cinderella
63-2_1571.01_3.63.wav_ASR	and they danced the night away
63-2_1575.707_4.89.wav_ASR	and then at twelve o'clock she said she hadta
63-2_1580.617_5.67.wav_ASR	and while she was going one of her slippers was left on the ground
63-2_1586.306_15.28.wav_ASR	and so when she got home cinderella was back on her in her shaky clothes and with dogs and cats and everything
63-2_1601.634_26.69.wav_ASR	and then the the the shoe was sposta be broken by by the ugly mother
63-2_1629.078_3.66.wav_ASR	but they they it was
63-2_1632.753_6.42.wav_ASR	and and so cinderella put on a shoe
63-2_1639.194_4.61.wav_ASR	two and it was exact match cinderella other other
63-2_1644.445_0.98.wav_ASR	so she knew it was
63-2_1646.792_3.37.wav_ASR	and so her the princess got married
63-2_1650.177_1.77.wav_ASR	and they lived happily ever after
63-2_1666.397_8.74.wav_ASR	you put on one one you put two slices of bread together
63-2_1675.69_2.37.wav_ASR	one with peanut butter one with jelly
63-2_1678.161_2.74.wav_ASR	and you get them together
63-2_1680.917_3.87.wav_ASR	and you got a peanut butter and jelly sandwich
65-1_9.517_0.96.wav_ASR	seems to be accurate
65-1_28.81_2.53.wav_ASR	the eighty four incident last year was five days before
65-1_35.471_0.49.wav_ASR	well i see
65-1_36.531_2.9.wav_ASR	they happen on a thursday march thirtieth four
65-1_40.334_5.76.wav_ASR	four i remember we're at some friends' house having supper the previous saturday night
65-1_46.238_15.54.wav_ASR	and i remember nothing nothing after that and till until after out of i c u and started started remembering things slowly about three days after i's moved out of the c u
65-1_63.223_3.95.wav_ASR	and the eight ninety ninety
65-1_67.496_0.83.wav_ASR	and i see the
65-1_69.041_4.34.wav_ASR	was crossing tenth street in annapolis
65-1_74.421_2.67.wav_ASR	and i remember crossing in the emergency room
65-1_77.109_7.56.wav_ASR	crossing with the light and seeing getting up close to the carriage on the car going from west east
65-1_86.021_1.74.wav_ASR	and then i had the sensation that it's spinning around
65-1_87.783_6.82.wav_ASR	and that's then last i remember for probably twenty twenty minutes or so
65-1_104.608_1.57.wav_ASR	the other one
65-1_107.092_0.66.wav_ASR	the one
65-1_107.8_10.32.wav_ASR	it was very that was really troubling because really troubling because didn't know where i was
65-1_119.162_6.17.wav_ASR	and there were visitors in the hospital room
65-1_125.543_3.84.wav_ASR	and these guys were saying they they the visitor
65-1_129.431_3.17.wav_ASR	and i knew who they were knew the these people
65-1_132.616_1.52.wav_ASR	but there's a lot of them there
65-1_134.184_1.5.wav_ASR	and i didn't know where i was
65-1_136.291_2.12.wav_ASR	there were several people visiting me
65-1_138.802_1.63.wav_ASR	and and there's several masks
65-1_141.127_1.76.wav_ASR	well when when is his voice gonna come back
65-1_143.169_1.03.wav_ASR	when is the horse gonna come back
65-1_145.808_1.58.wav_ASR	and i thought i was perfectly fine
65-1_148.727_11.07.wav_ASR	and but what i didn't know was that the had spent ten days with a breathing tube hooked down my throat and a camera
65-1_160.403_2.47.wav_ASR	and then look like it was gonna come out right
65-1_162.888_1.7.wav_ASR	and it gave me a tricycle
65-1_165.547_13.33.wav_ASR	and and so what turned out to be firstnamet and firstnamem changed my voice pretty radically where my wife hadta had told me
65-1_178.901_7.83.wav_ASR	and she said that the you you you hadta dance
65-1_190.21_0.31.wav_ASR	so she said
65-1_190.701_1.11.wav_ASR	actually there there was
65-1_191.914_1.46.wav_ASR	well one thing like about me
65-1_193.584_0.55.wav_ASR	and that was gone
65-1_194.184_7.67.wav_ASR	that's that was it was extraordinarily troublesome because i i said i didn't know where i was
65-1_202.556_3.45.wav_ASR	when people recognize it's recognize the same
65-1_206.835_1.36.wav_ASR	when is firstnamew coming back
65-1_208.855_1.99.wav_ASR	and i was really really really struggling him
65-1_211.097_0.7.wav_ASR	really terrible
65-1_214.441_2.34.wav_ASR	that was one of the first of the memories
65-1_227.068_4.71.wav_ASR	well it's what what ended up being was at the
65-1_232.093_9.72.wav_ASR	and turns of my brain injury if you will certain things kinda stand out and are already struggling
65-1_242.008_14.18.wav_ASR	and it just when when i happen to get get focus on something i didn't particularly understand or or improve of i get get it if it didn't show
65-1_256.236_2.98.wav_ASR	it was extraordinarily angry
65-1_261.478_2.001.wav_ASR	and did never did like out
65-1_264.808_2.63.wav_ASR	but just really really angry
65-1_267.486_1.47.wav_ASR	and i kept on trying
65-1_268.978_5.53.wav_ASR	and it was very very really troublesome really troublesome for a law for for quite awhile
65-1_291.425_2.81.wav_ASR	and and and i don't want you ever to relate to that
65-1_294.408_3.91.wav_ASR	oh i wouldn't wish out of anybody
65-1_316.655_7.65.wav_ASR	the almost ninety ninety is almost a
65-1_324.396_0.55.wav_ASR	again
65-1_325.376_0.84.wav_ASR	and that's all
65-1_326.232_3.43.wav_ASR	it was just just a reround but not near as severe
65-1_330.55_12.55.wav_ASR	but the the eighty four incident was was most interesting because because an engineer from my the company is employed by
65-1_343.181_6.64.wav_ASR	what they called the hippo or hippopotamist hospital having a wonderful career of me
65-1_349.842_1.58.wav_ASR	he was gonna go to the emergency room
65-1_352.182_4.66.wav_ASR	and and my one of my supervisors told me
65-1_356.862_0.89.wav_ASR	and he wasn't sposta do it
65-1_357.802_6.2.wav_ASR	so i was on the hip hop list which meant i was going far
65-1_364.136_1.18.wav_ASR	my career's laid out front of them
65-1_366.048_2.15.wav_ASR	there was nothing stopping me
65-1_369.12_8.58.wav_ASR	and then after the eighty four incident personnel change which i find out twenty years later is indom bea state
65-1_377.717_1.63.wav_ASR	who i find at twenty years later in denver
65-1_380.151_3.17.wav_ASR	and the cinderella
65-1_384.141_2.67.wav_ASR	and i was slower to comprehend things
65-1_387.869_5.87.wav_ASR	but finally did after it taking taking more time for comprehension
65-1_393.757_7.06.wav_ASR	and and and i couldn't do my engineering job to to to suit me
65-1_401.669_1.51.wav_ASR	and i didn't didn't tell anybody that
65-1_403.668_0.89.wav_ASR	well i didn't tell anybody that
65-1_404.612_0.8.wav_ASR	that's right i faked it
65-1_406.295_17.87.wav_ASR	and i faced it and spent my lunch hours for months by myself in a conference room relearning aspects of my job and not telling a soul because i just knew
65-1_424.226_1.26.wav_ASR	it's a four forty eight
65-1_426.413_1.47.wav_ASR	midnight nine eighty four again
65-1_428.188_2.09.wav_ASR	actually before the emergencies of disability
65-1_430.428_0.54.wav_ASR	hi how are you
65-1_432.046_2.46.wav_ASR	and and i was in the accident nineteen four
65-1_434.528_1.11.wav_ASR	well i don't county business
65-1_436.8_5.82.wav_ASR	and i i just knew that that not be able to complain at base access of my job
65-1_443.288_1.95.wav_ASR	actually i just knew i was gonna get fired
65-1_445.562_0.85.wav_ASR	and i knew i was
65-1_447.165_8.14.wav_ASR	had three kids a wife and spouse were just a lovely lovely loving woman there at home with the three kids
65-1_455.32_2.19.wav_ASR	and i was the engineer
65-1_458.431_2.45.wav_ASR	and i couldn't stand thought of being fired
65-1_461.855_5.49.wav_ASR	and and so i like to say did everything i could to relearn my job
65-1_467.981_7.74.wav_ASR	and it took me probably a couple three years to figure out that that i was no longer on the fast track
65-1_476.146_1.08.wav_ASR	and no no no
65-1_477.247_2.36.wav_ASR	it wasn't obvious a person
65-1_479.684_3.22.wav_ASR	but i it was no longer a hospital
65-1_482.928_9.4.wav_ASR	and and the most most difficult part of that was the short term disabilities
65-1_493.261_11.8.wav_ASR	and so i ended up with a frenchman and would write down everything in there just to help my short term memory
65-1_506.11_10.319.wav_ASR	so it was a largely the aphasia and and people seeing me differently at work
65-1_516.482_4.701.wav_ASR	and and of course i look back back on it a few years after
65-1_521.2_2.859.wav_ASR	and and i did not deserve to be on the fast track
65-1_524.107_3.97.wav_ASR	it it it was perfectly obvious to everybody around me
65-1_528.092_0.72.wav_ASR	it was nice to me
65-1_530.176_14.41.wav_ASR	and that the writing everything down was was the biggest biggest assistant assistant to me at to help help me
65-1_567.07_6.54.wav_ASR	the basically it was the the
65-1_573.891_4.62.wav_ASR	and i i call it pre eighty four austin texas
65-1_579.419_5.17.wav_ASR	that's that's how my my my life has been defined
65-1_585.51_11.37.wav_ASR	and that that that is what i call my my finishing moment at the the the finishing event
65-1_597.64_8.89.wav_ASR	because i've struggled with the the aphasia obviously and memory issues ever since then
65-1_606.552_13.22.wav_ASR	and and i mean for example the the the window of seventy six seventy seven is out of engineering school at purdue
65-1_619.826_1.84.wav_ASR	you had a job in denapolis
65-1_621.855_7.67.wav_ASR	and so and the economic viability i i i paid rent to my folks lived in their house
65-1_630.113_6.18.wav_ASR	and that winter my dad and i put the oldsmobile va in a little small car
65-1_637.015_3.44.wav_ASR	and it was quite an interesting interesting project
65-1_641.315_4.08.wav_ASR	and and interesting enough i can probably
65-1_645.41_8.3.wav_ASR	the the engineer had a robot four jeez car bracket on it which had some difficulties
65-1_653.791_1.8.wav_ASR	and i could probably still today
65-1_655.869_1.58.wav_ASR	and this is ninety seven
65-1_658.288_2.76.wav_ASR	and probably still today it rebuild a camera blindfold but
65-1_662.6_3.89.wav_ASR	and but but i asked him what had for supper last night
65-1_667.122_0.49.wav_ASR	can't think
65-1_669.274_0.66.wav_ASR	so yeah
65-1_670.235_1.4.wav_ASR	short short form of the story
65-1_671.658_13.02.wav_ASR	but then things from from from long ago and do do something something long ago i i can reconstruct like was yesterday
65-1_695.671_5.07.wav_ASR	now actually i was ended up i think probably medicare there
65-1_701.591_4.64.wav_ASR	and and i got out of school the spring of seventy six
65-1_706.317_1.95.wav_ASR	at a job at the company name firstnamesu
65-1_709.739_0.87.wav_ASR	they're in annapolis
65-1_710.687_2.65.wav_ASR	and firstnamed no longer exists
65-1_714.262_5.09.wav_ASR	but i was an engineer at that with the switch
65-1_720.011_10.31.wav_ASR	and so i i my customers for what we'll call it or annie cooley funds for whitmore light track for whitmore track
65-1_731.149_9.58.wav_ASR	four of them one of the small four parts i hadta a calendar just baltimore
65-1_745.046_7.51.wav_ASR	and the firstnamel al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al bl al
65-1_753.154_4.14.wav_ASR	so i was already doing that kind of stuff as a job
65-1_758.166_6.91.wav_ASR	but then my my father found this this article on an english version of the shiver lag vega
65-1_765.797_12.68.wav_ASR	and it just happened to be that it was a project for him at night to build together that winter while while i was working in the audio industry field
65-1_778.497_8.96.wav_ASR	and and it it's kind of how i graduated
65-1_815.779_2.14.wav_ASR	it was a real slipper
65-1_818.492_4.39.wav_ASR	and the car at the time was at the dot in two forty see
65-1_823.884_3.99.wav_ASR	it was at the first to the de kars
65-1_828.597_6.2.wav_ASR	and and from a stop light dust those guys off
65-1_835.141_6.83.wav_ASR	and the other guys the the driver's a dog is barking
65-1_842.229_5.21.wav_ASR	it was a lot of fun seeing looks in her face as it and in my remarriage
65-1_910.099_1.2.wav_ASR	oh okay
65-1_911.875_2.36.wav_ASR	the story is there's a a young lady
65-1_914.589_8.46.wav_ASR	looks like maybe maybe a teenager like a six graduate or seven graduate and kicking a soccer ball
65-1_923.492_6.72.wav_ASR	and then an iron kick puts a soccer ball through a a house of window
65-1_930.915_8.97.wav_ASR	and the soccer ball comes through the house window and and lands on a a adult male mail's lap in the house
65-1_940.813_7.32.wav_ASR	and the adult gets up holding the soccer ball and looks through the hole in the window and says trying to figure out what's going on
65-1_951.714_0.38.wav_ASR	done
65-1_971.063_5.65.wav_ASR	it looks like a a a young boy is leaving
65-1_976.736_2.88.wav_ASR	and as his mother said
65-1_979.897_1.4.wav_ASR	here's here's your umbrella
65-1_981.983_0.84.wav_ASR	and he says
65-1_983.049_1.03.wav_ASR	and i don't need that
65-1_984.13_4.77.wav_ASR	and and then they leaves saying goodbye and everything
65-1_989.831_1.61.wav_ASR	and the mom's holding the umbrella
65-1_991.969_3.23.wav_ASR	and the the young lad is out at about walking around
65-1_995.914_1.2.wav_ASR	and starts to rain
65-1_997.78_1.36.wav_ASR	and it starts raining heavier
65-1_999.75_0.79.wav_ASR	and he's running
65-1_1000.563_4.18.wav_ASR	and gets back to his mom so soaking wet
65-1_1005.358_0.87.wav_ASR	and he's not happy
65-1_1006.245_1.13.wav_ASR	and no it's not her
65-1_1008.212_2.37.wav_ASR	and then he goes out finally with an umbrella
65-1_1010.631_3.09.wav_ASR	and and it looks like all is right
65-1_1027.309_5.9.wav_ASR	well the beginning it looks like a cat a cat climbed up a tree
65-1_1034.269_3.46.wav_ASR	and being probably chased by a dog climbed up a tree
65-1_1038.222_1.16.wav_ASR	got stuck up on the tree
65-1_1040.013_8.761.wav_ASR	and a little girl who was probably her owner threw over there in her tricycle and then wants her cat down
65-1_1049.333_10.48.wav_ASR	and looks like an adult male figure most likely her dad had climbed up the tree to get the cat and is and is caught up there by this barking dog
65-1_1060.56_5.52.wav_ASR	also and now then there's also a a bird over the other side of the tree singing away
65-1_1066.533_11.02.wav_ASR	and there's also the local fire department is showing up with their ladder to try get down both the the cat and the the the male figure
65-1_1077.577_2.22.wav_ASR	that's that's that tree by the dog
65-1_1353.355_0.3.wav_ASR	what do you think
65-1_1353.835_5.45.wav_ASR	and cinderella was her mother had passed away
65-1_1360.127_2.77.wav_ASR	father remarried
65-1_1363.72_8.84.wav_ASR	and there's the wicked stepmother and that brought with her two two rather mean spirited daughters
65-1_1373.655_13.75.wav_ASR	and and in their home life the cinderella treated poorly by the stepmother and abused happily by the stepdaughters
65-1_1387.769_7.59.wav_ASR	and and it just worked worked a lot
65-1_1395.968_9.9.wav_ASR	and then in the kingdom the king had a unmarried son
65-1_1406.524_19.39.wav_ASR	and one of his visitors decided to have a ball to with invite all the eligible ladies in the kingdom with the prince married off
65-1_1427.134_24.41.wav_ASR	and the and so cinderella with the help of the mice and there in the house at sewed up a a really lovely gown for cinderella to go to to wear this ball
65-1_1451.694_17.08.wav_ASR	and and the stepmother one of her daughters married off and and then so would not allow cinderella to go to the ball
65-1_1469.504_3.98.wav_ASR	her stepsisters went
65-1_1474.182_11.98.wav_ASR	and and a a carriage looked like a a pumpkin and then mice went up but turned into horses
65-1_1486.874_8.89.wav_ASR	and i think the the the horse from the house ended up as the driver of the of the pumpkin carriage
65-1_1496.594_3.35.wav_ASR	and the she she got a going to the ball
65-1_1499.966_5.76.wav_ASR	also the the prince danced night away with cinderella
65-1_1506.4_12.64.wav_ASR	and but the stepmother was he hadta be back by midnight because everything was gonna go back to the way it was at midnight
65-1_1519.217_1.04.wav_ASR	so it was
65-1_1520.273_3.71.wav_ASR	so she heard out of there and left a glass slipper behind
65-1_1524.602_11.17.wav_ASR	and then and then after the the the prince said there's only one person interested in her
65-1_1535.789_2.93.wav_ASR	and it was the the girl left the glass slipper behind
65-1_1538.769_9.72.wav_ASR	and and so the the invite was sent out to the kingdom to try and figure out who was that lady left a glass slipper behind
65-1_1549.451_11.43.wav_ASR	and and it was the the lady who's whose foot would fit this this small glass slipper
65-1_1561.723_3.47.wav_ASR	and the stepsisters neither one of them fit the glass slipper
65-1_1565.701_3.72.wav_ASR	and cinderella's foot would fit in the slipper
65-1_1569.443_7.35.wav_ASR	and so she was identified as the one that the the prince wanted to marry
65-1_1576.915_5.67.wav_ASR	and and so then the cinderella remarried
65-1_1582.609_2.0.wav_ASR	and all lived happily ever after
65-1_1595.381_4.76.wav_ASR	preferably on on white bread
65-1_1600.8_8.05.wav_ASR	you would use a knife and and spread the peanut butter on one side of the bread
65-1_1609.79_6.11.wav_ASR	but then the other other other bread the official jelly is grape jelly
65-1_1617.339_1.5.wav_ASR	and then she'd take a spoon
65-1_1619.081_5.76.wav_ASR	now not knife because he cut up the the the jelly and the jar
65-1_1624.893_6.9.wav_ASR	but you take your spoon and and spoon out the the grape jelly on the other piece of bread
65-1_1632.163_2.41.wav_ASR	use the knife spread it out
65-1_1634.597_2.32.wav_ASR	and then then put the two together
65-1_1636.935_3.5.wav_ASR	and you got the alphabet peanut butter and jelly sandwich
65-2_8.167_1.85.wav_ASR	spakes i don't know
65-2_10.563_0.77.wav_ASR	much improve
65-2_12.338_9.08.wav_ASR	the the hailing of speaking for words occurs less than it does
65-2_22.185_23.08.wav_ASR	the what what happens is that the if i have an acquisition to tell a story or something like that i will may do it in the and the most basic form and and think later
65-2_45.514_1.3.wav_ASR	and i i should have said this
65-2_46.935_0.67.wav_ASR	and i couldn't said that
65-2_48.111_1.09.wav_ASR	why why didn't i say it
65-2_49.95_6.53.wav_ASR	if i'm familiar in the trouble shooting a amateur of electronics if there's some difficulty with a car
65-2_57.16_5.08.wav_ASR	it helps immediately if i think about it for a day or so
65-2_62.323_26.47.wav_ASR	and and unless i've seen it before the the the overnight or the the length of time spent analyzing and thinking about it and considering all the different aspects of the problem technically technically mechanically at time is the most of the most institute
65-2_89.557_8.62.wav_ASR	and it it is and i'll i'll get a long idea
65-2_98.79_1.57.wav_ASR	why didn't i think that before
65-2_100.765_5.64.wav_ASR	if before my eighty four action i would've thought of that immediately
65-2_107.061_5.26.wav_ASR	but it's much more difficult and and takes a longer than it did
65-2_112.37_1.84.wav_ASR	and that's it's like
65-2_114.233_1.4.wav_ASR	it's been that way for thirty six years
65-2_127.18_6.21.wav_ASR	the first one was a tibon at an intersection
65-2_134.294_2.7.wav_ASR	and ended up being
65-2_137.011_6.39.wav_ASR	and i i caught the old international harvester's group in the driver's side door
65-2_144.01_12.54.wav_ASR	and had a shattered glass broken hip five broken ribs fractured skull a a baseball skull firstnamed firstnamed firstnamed firstnamed
65-2_157.19_1.61.wav_ASR	did i say punctuated long
65-2_159.526_1.7.wav_ASR	seventy years of blood
65-2_161.937_1.51.wav_ASR	three and a car
65-2_164.72_6.62.wav_ASR	and and a coma for three and a half weeks
65-2_172.132_7.28.wav_ASR	hospital probably probably about two and a half months
65-2_180.19_6.53.wav_ASR	and our third child was born three days after i moved out of pjsu
65-2_190.003_8.12.wav_ASR	and the second one was february nineteen ninety ninety
65-2_199.113_2.48.wav_ASR	it was a harvard medical on the left side
65-2_202.563_6.32.wav_ASR	and and believe that i was unconscious for
65-2_209.678_1.66.wav_ASR	well i i guess i don't know how long
65-2_212.237_10.04.wav_ASR	but i recall walking across the street starting across and seeing the car in front of me
65-2_223.056_2.51.wav_ASR	and then i had the sentence being spunted around
65-2_226.386_7.17.wav_ASR	and then and then later like i i i first i remember things maybe
65-2_234.386_0.46.wav_ASR	well i don't know
65-2_234.865_0.96.wav_ASR	twenty minutes later
65-2_236.459_2.59.wav_ASR	and and i i was in a great marriage
65-2_239.878_5.52.wav_ASR	it was in a wonderful mood because the eighty four accident the last time i remember five days before the accident
65-2_246.349_7.14.wav_ASR	and and this one fifteen ninety ninety i know exactly where i was when what happened
65-2_254.174_2.51.wav_ASR	and i was in a really great
65-2_257.551_13.19.wav_ASR	and then i say a a a brain injury because i think it was about to one day or two days later i developed a a double vision
65-2_271.809_19.88.wav_ASR	and i was that was the most important pain and in the leg from from that the not knowing if the double vision would ever go away was most concerning if you
65-2_292.55_3.94.wav_ASR	it did finally go away when the brain swelling went down
65-2_296.863_0.66.wav_ASR	finally we went
65-2_297.627_3.16.wav_ASR	and i call maybe three four or five
65-2_303.117_1.68.wav_ASR	the last a senior in about a time
65-2_305.602_7.65.wav_ASR	and and the doctors could not tell me whether that would ever go away
65-2_313.306_5.33.wav_ASR	it was extraordinarily painful
65-2_318.652_8.33.wav_ASR	and i recall that the orthopedic guy that stuck a pin in my in my tibbi said
65-2_327.006_12.71.wav_ASR	and all after after three or four months when when the all the the firefighters and the fireman started to help he said
65-2_340.67_4.18.wav_ASR	oh you know that's probably the most painful injury known to man
65-2_345.576_0.85.wav_ASR	oh okay
65-2_346.527_1.96.wav_ASR	well what's his name being a big baby then right
65-2_349.558_1.88.wav_ASR	and he he he taught them
65-2_353.552_2.83.wav_ASR	that's kind of it
65-2_356.478_4.01.wav_ASR	that those are the two actions in at at at a top level
65-2_372.985_7.65.wav_ASR	well west tenth and tenth and firstnamet going into my apartment firstnamea and firstnamet
65-2_399.4_12.1.wav_ASR	the after the first eighty four incident when i did not know
65-2_411.553_17.22.wav_ASR	what what happened was at the eighty four lap tops were first adopted if you know by by by the company
65-2_429.508_17.32.wav_ASR	and and my my boss at that time brought one brought one down for me to
65-2_447.04_0.75.wav_ASR	oh call it
65-2_449.397_1.27.wav_ASR	and we'll say we're going to play with
65-2_450.939_2.51.wav_ASR	but to learn how to use their their home
65-2_454.232_6.24.wav_ASR	and of course this is before the web eighty four and and those kind of things
65-2_460.758_11.03.wav_ASR	and i've been doing a firstnamen which is firstnamesa a structural illness work for quite a long time
65-2_472.499_9.05.wav_ASR	and but that was all on ibm a a punch card and that kind of stuff or or a desk computer
65-2_482.344_4.62.wav_ASR	and and so here is a a simple little laptop
65-2_486.979_1.14.wav_ASR	well i don't know how to use it
65-2_488.329_4.44.wav_ASR	and and so my boss brought his laptop down there
65-2_492.784_4.6.wav_ASR	and and those years there was a a university that came along with him
65-2_498.448_4.81.wav_ASR	and it's a computer computer use a manual
65-2_503.994_7.47.wav_ASR	if you're read a microphone of any kind they are extraordinarily difficult
65-2_512.342_14.661.wav_ASR	and one of the one the one thing in particular which it was prominent when in the magazine was and it said to select something
65-2_528.184_0.51.wav_ASR	select
65-2_528.839_12.43.wav_ASR	well having never had any training in in a laptop or microsoft off what what did select me
65-2_542.262_6.07.wav_ASR	and and after several days of trying to figure out what select meet
65-2_548.888_1.04.wav_ASR	there's a hospital
65-2_550.399_0.6.wav_ASR	it's like me
65-2_551.438_0.49.wav_ASR	oh fish
65-2_552.509_5.58.wav_ASR	what what they meant by select i couldn't figure it
65-2_558.551_0.56.wav_ASR	it couldn't
65-2_559.312_1.04.wav_ASR	there is no way
65-2_560.944_2.31.wav_ASR	and i've already really troubled by it
65-2_564.422_5.97.wav_ASR	and so so finally i called a coworker and said
65-2_570.608_3.88.wav_ASR	what what what does this mean when they say relax
65-2_575.568_7.44.wav_ASR	and to describe the head tapping the cursor and moving the cursor along the circle down and highlighting an area
65-2_583.899_1.23.wav_ASR	that's what they meant by relax
65-2_585.777_2.95.wav_ASR	well hell that was never described in the manual at all
65-2_589.857_3.86.wav_ASR	and that that really that threw me for a loop or several
65-2_594.838_7.3.wav_ASR	and so i i became very questioning as to whether whether i would could go back to work and even function at work
65-2_603.43_5.21.wav_ASR	and and so finally the the the tip from the cow worker
65-2_609.025_0.57.wav_ASR	oh okay
65-2_609.645_8.98.wav_ASR	but it was most basic of terms which the the dog man
65-2_619.047_2.1.wav_ASR	but i know there's a dog not microphone
65-2_621.166_1.3.wav_ASR	it was before michael kors existed
65-2_623.365_14.01.wav_ASR	as a dogman it did not do not complain with somebody would'd have the the gall enough and temperament enough to question him in person of cinderella
65-2_638.605_1.01.wav_ASR	they did not
65-2_640.35_2.3.wav_ASR	the dossman it did not describe that anywhere
65-2_643.738_14.19.wav_ASR	and so so i went back to work and struggling with aphasia and short term memory issues and the like and trying to to to function
65-2_658.457_15.64.wav_ASR	and and finally after a couple years the company brought out to a what they called a franklin and and said
65-2_675.07_5.2.wav_ASR	you might take the franklin and then write stuff down
65-2_681.229_2.47.wav_ASR	and so well that was a good thing
65-2_684.72_2.15.wav_ASR	and we're just being able to the right right thing down
65-2_686.892_1.67.wav_ASR	so i i carry a small
65-2_689.233_0.96.wav_ASR	have with me right now
65-2_690.968_8.11.wav_ASR	still i carry a small notebook notebook notebook wherever i go yet today
65-2_699.671_10.58.wav_ASR	because that that was writing what i figured out it when when my my boss told me how to write down with a frankin planner
65-2_710.85_7.47.wav_ASR	all the motorcycle that was that was a new a new lease on life if you know
65-2_719.266_2.66.wav_ASR	that that that particular
65-2_721.95_17.32.wav_ASR	and and also i ended up as a later manager for the company in the defense products meeting all kinds of people at that shows shows a conference that kind of stuff
65-2_739.905_10.88.wav_ASR	when i meet somebody new i will always say their name over and over and over again silently to myself
65-2_751.358_5.4.wav_ASR	use their name and any kind of verbal verbal conversation with them
65-2_757.276_2.99.wav_ASR	you're a name every time first last name or or both
65-2_760.315_4.68.wav_ASR	and and then after after the conversation right there down
65-2_766.354_8.45.wav_ASR	and and that that's a a holiday crack that i that i still use today
65-2_775.921_2.94.wav_ASR	for example i met a in our neighborhood met a
65-2_779.492_1.18.wav_ASR	and i'm at home now
65-2_781.203_0.98.wav_ASR	not down the farm
65-2_782.926_11.55.wav_ASR	met a fellow in the neighborhood out for a walk of several days ago and and he moved to the neighbor's some time back
65-2_794.526_1.25.wav_ASR	and i got a knife
65-2_795.797_6.87.wav_ASR	and and said his name over and over and the like and told my wife about it and then then wrote it down
65-2_803.378_7.6.wav_ASR	and this morning i saw him out for a walk and and couldn't recall his name at first but then i thought for awhile
65-2_810.996_1.51.wav_ASR	and then finally finally the name came to him
65-2_813.742_14.39.wav_ASR	so but but the the discipline on on recalling names is quite has been quite quite an enable tool and helped me return to functionality
65-2_839.375_0.52.wav_ASR	yes
65-2_840.697_4.78.wav_ASR	the i think i entered to a last week
65-2_846.085_1.32.wav_ASR	and i made up a posse there
65-2_847.746_4.92.wav_ASR	at the rehab hospital in denver is a volunteer or four or seven
65-2_853.54_6.13.wav_ASR	and because i started off four with a twenty eighty index
65-2_860.446_8.79.wav_ASR	and it became rather troubling to me because having they just didn't do therapy for the brain endor in those years
65-2_869.993_1.69.wav_ASR	so there's no therapy
65-2_871.699_1.97.wav_ASR	they're able to drive
65-2_873.684_3.67.wav_ASR	well if you're able to just get a stroke hospital go on
65-2_878.184_5.53.wav_ASR	and as they just did not do therapy in those years
65-2_883.737_16.3.wav_ASR	and and of course the next twenty years wife and i found out about from people that had at therapy brain injuries later that the a disease rate much a brain engineer approached ninety percent
65-2_901.056_3.61.wav_ASR	and the suicide right at the brain is four to five times normal average
65-2_905.719_4.72.wav_ASR	it's what they're telling people even fifteen years ago
65-2_911.291_15.93.wav_ASR	and so i wanted to share that with with patients at rgi to just to give them hope that that recovery is possible
65-2_928.404_1.38.wav_ASR	it takes a long time
65-2_930.61_10.94.wav_ASR	and in oh four when i started there at arlington it was i heard neurosurgeons telling patients and their families
65-2_942.297_1.58.wav_ASR	oh a year and a year afterwards
65-2_944.156_1.01.wav_ASR	four years and everything
65-2_945.302_0.94.wav_ASR	you're older than everybody
65-2_947.407_3.51.wav_ASR	hey you don't stop recovering
65-2_950.937_7.04.wav_ASR	and the rate maybe asymmetric if you will and slow down pretty rapidly after a year or half
65-2_958.775_1.9.wav_ASR	you never never stop recovering
65-2_961.454_7.72.wav_ASR	and the eighty eighty eighty fifty i had a a dead spot with no feeling above the left
65-2_970.136_2.65.wav_ASR	and there's something that i kept
65-2_972.842_1.73.wav_ASR	and there was a pumpkin out there
65-2_974.655_0.98.wav_ASR	you know no big deal
65-2_975.956_3.16.wav_ASR	to stick a pin there and all wouldn't wouldn't fit
65-2_979.96_1.4.wav_ASR	oh no no big deal
65-2_981.865_4.86.wav_ASR	and then it was probably be five years ago or something about twenty twelve
65-2_987.413_0.4.wav_ASR	think you know
65-2_987.879_0.74.wav_ASR	and i think it was alright
65-2_989.309_5.7.wav_ASR	twenty five years after the eighty four incident i was in the bedroom put in my sock socks one morning
65-2_996.424_4.47.wav_ASR	and i had feeling in the spot that had no feeling with twenty five years
65-2_1002.063_12.36.wav_ASR	so what i'm telling actually is that the recovery may slow down significantly like i say and mathematically describe it but still slowly slowly
65-2_1014.632_2.9.wav_ASR	that's still it never stopped recovering
65-2_1017.689_1.16.wav_ASR	you just don't stop recovering
65-2_1019.52_6.059.wav_ASR	well i'm done practicing
65-2_1068.805_3.42.wav_ASR	yes it's not not risky i
65-2_1072.242_7.48.wav_ASR	it's it's it's you time is the best at you're worst ally and in those kind of cases
65-2_1080.467_7.98.wav_ASR	because you you the feeling that you don't have it will listen and listen in importance
65-2_1088.535_2.52.wav_ASR	and and you'll notice one day you know
65-2_1091.749_2.26.wav_ASR	well crack i i i feel there it didn't happen before
65-2_1094.551_1.56.wav_ASR	actually it will happen
65-2_1096.384_0.98.wav_ASR	you will imagine that
65-2_1108.416_2.63.wav_ASR	actually didn't know
65-2_1111.095_6.75.wav_ASR	it's i mean i was useta feel like a little pencil every once in a while
65-2_1118.126_4.87.wav_ASR	the i don't know if i got useta it or or informed it or
65-2_1124.138_3.5.wav_ASR	but like i said twenty five years later just put on the socks one morning
65-2_1128.17_0.83.wav_ASR	peanut peanut butter
65-2_1129.343_1.05.wav_ASR	and i got feeling there
65-2_1131.24_2.06.wav_ASR	and had had none before
65-2_1134.534_0.63.wav_ASR	and i went happy
65-2_1135.397_0.91.wav_ASR	and i have no idea
65-2_1149.083_1.64.wav_ASR	they well it will they went
65-2_1150.924_0.87.wav_ASR	and nurses were working
65-2_1151.84_1.31.wav_ASR	and they they will i said
65-2_1153.17_0.46.wav_ASR	they will
65-2_1173.169_4.87.wav_ASR	when when i i first first time in met my wife
65-2_1179.585_5.52.wav_ASR	when when she and i first met we were high school graduates
65-2_1185.345_2.45.wav_ASR	and we went to different hospitals together
65-2_1188.603_5.09.wav_ASR	her from and here washing in denver and washing in denver
65-2_1193.708_1.47.wav_ASR	myself from a plane fell
65-2_1195.197_4.75.wav_ASR	and it was before classes started at purdue
65-2_1200.599_1.59.wav_ASR	august and nineteen seventy two
65-2_1203.067_4.66.wav_ASR	her first day on campus
65-2_1208.447_1.29.wav_ASR	my first day of campus
65-2_1210.419_10.65.wav_ASR	there was to be a a dance at the the door i was staying at this this one night at
65-2_1221.089_2.26.wav_ASR	again again it's the first first day of christmas
65-2_1224.373_5.17.wav_ASR	and and and i was a little bit early
65-2_1229.596_7.78.wav_ASR	well i i'll arrive at the place a little bit early giving control of of the situation
65-2_1238.004_3.79.wav_ASR	and so i ended up being just a little bit early for the dance there
65-2_1242.551_5.71.wav_ASR	and and my wife and her her wingman
65-2_1248.927_1.99.wav_ASR	girl girl's going with bobby
65-2_1251.625_0.36.wav_ASR	peanut butter
65-2_1252.36_7.75.wav_ASR	firstnamew firstnamew firstnamee and firstnamew showed up there at at this this
65-2_1260.78_3.88.wav_ASR	and the wife was never a stranger
65-2_1265.396_2.78.wav_ASR	they she is the a a a treasure
65-2_1268.95_2.08.wav_ASR	and then you look up and firstnamee firstnamee and say
65-2_1272.802_5.88.wav_ASR	but anyway so she and a girl friend walked up to me and said
65-2_1278.901_2.74.wav_ASR	he is the the dance here
65-2_1281.66_2.44.wav_ASR	well well i think
65-2_1284.355_0.44.wav_ASR	oh sorry to be
65-2_1284.946_0.71.wav_ASR	that's why i
65-2_1285.671_4.64.wav_ASR	and and we i hung around
65-2_1290.557_3.4.wav_ASR	and i i ran her that that that dance
65-2_1294.796_2.28.wav_ASR	and that's where we started dating
65-2_1297.1_3.94.wav_ASR	and and it's a three years or so
65-2_1301.09_1.27.wav_ASR	they died in around about three years ago
65-2_1303.312_4.59.wav_ASR	and after about four years i figured out that well maybe something was going on here
65-2_1307.917_1.44.wav_ASR	and i'll get more serious about this
65-2_1310.334_6.28.wav_ASR	so it was just i i i i assume her of of packing me up at a school dance
65-2_1317.648_2.02.wav_ASR	that's where we first met and she picked me up in day
65-2_1359.514_5.59.wav_ASR	young a young boy's looking like a soccer is had a soccer
65-2_1365.124_0.54.wav_ASR	well i'll kick you out
65-2_1366.388_2.61.wav_ASR	the ends up going through the window
65-2_1369.723_9.4.wav_ASR	and a gentleman on a couch there in the window is sitting right where the soccer ball comes through and knocks a lamp down and surprises him
65-2_1379.989_6.19.wav_ASR	and then he he gets to balls stands by the window trying to find out just to what went on
65-2_1402.182_12.63.wav_ASR	and the beginning this this mother it appears is had an umbrella and wanted to give it to her son before goes off to school or goes somewhere
65-2_1415.551_2.24.wav_ASR	and he he said
65-2_1418.288_0.93.wav_ASR	and he says no and says
65-2_1419.62_0.77.wav_ASR	oh no mommy
65-2_1421.306_1.08.wav_ASR	and then dimly
65-2_1422.451_2.41.wav_ASR	and then in the middle and started raining on him
65-2_1425.438_1.43.wav_ASR	and then rain heavier on him
65-2_1426.933_7.19.wav_ASR	and then and then he goes back home just to soak with mother kind of frowning at the bone as with mother kind of frowning at the bone
65-2_1434.453_6.25.wav_ASR	and then the end of the story was he learned his lesson and has the umbrella with him as walking in the rain
65-2_1455.01_13.73.wav_ASR	the way this started was that and it looks like that there is a a dog at the base of the tree a a male at the first tree limb
65-2_1469.12_2.18.wav_ASR	the dog is barking at this guy
65-2_1471.974_7.79.wav_ASR	and on the tree limb there's a cat with a girl down a tricycle down below this cat
65-2_1480.206_6.04.wav_ASR	and it would appear that a cat climbed up the tree
65-2_1487.152_3.15.wav_ASR	the little girl's cat climbed up the tree and got stuck up there
65-2_1491.016_10.21.wav_ASR	they they by mail a man was either being chased up the tree by the girl's cat
65-2_1501.878_3.4.wav_ASR	there's also a firetruck and a fire engine
65-2_1506.838_1.32.wav_ASR	the fireman carrying a ladder
65-2_1508.684_7.57.wav_ASR	and it looks like the the ladder is being used by the firemen to rescue either the the man or the cat or both
65-2_1517.004_11.24.wav_ASR	and and a songbird is over in a a a room firstnamet just observing the the old little story
65-2_1528.296_3.07.wav_ASR	the end
65-2_1754.983_9.4.wav_ASR	and cinderella was a the daughter of a king who was
65-2_1764.522_2.45.wav_ASR	and she her mother had passed away
65-2_1767.818_1.36.wav_ASR	and her father remarried
65-2_1769.925_8.29.wav_ASR	and the stepmother had two two daughters who were mean mean daughters
65-2_1778.914_21.3.wav_ASR	and after they were married the stepmother put cinderella work around the house where the stepdaughters were did did basically nothing
65-2_1801.139_8.38.wav_ASR	and so so cinderella spent her time working cleaning polishing the that kind of stuff around the house
65-2_1810.138_10.22.wav_ASR	and and in the kingdom there was a a prince who was not married
65-2_1821.196_18.68.wav_ASR	an employee to the king suggested a a a ball be held with the the express person of the kingdom
65-2_1840.902_3.19.wav_ASR	so the word is put out about the ball coming up
65-2_1844.858_6.3.wav_ASR	and cinderella was really happy about the ball coming coming up as were the the stepsisters
65-2_1851.712_16.43.wav_ASR	and so the the firm animals i mean birds mice made a a beautiful dress for cinderella for the ball
65-2_1868.918_10.26.wav_ASR	and and then at the last minute the stepmother told cinderella she was not going to the ball
65-2_1879.2_8.54.wav_ASR	and and the stepdaughters were really really mean to her
65-2_1888.574_2.81.wav_ASR	and so the stepdaughters went to the ball
65-2_1892.097_14.38.wav_ASR	and but in the meantime while before the ball or at the fairy godmother showed up and and said that well
65-2_1906.5_5.6.wav_ASR	and so it it made for her a lovely gown
65-2_1912.863_16.73.wav_ASR	and they and turned into a a pumpkin into a coach by by mice i believe that were at ended up turned into horses
65-2_1930.594_4.29.wav_ASR	and and so then she ended up going to the ball
65-2_1935.637_15.69.wav_ASR	and the prince was invited with step the stepdaughters and and everyone everyone around there and then and only hit it off with cinderella
65-2_1951.795_2.29.wav_ASR	and up spending the night dancing with cinderella
65-2_1954.409_7.13.wav_ASR	the her stepmother told cinderella that that you hafta be home by midnight because this is all and midnight
65-2_1962.363_5.08.wav_ASR	and so the the the prince and cinderella were dancing at midnight
65-2_1967.926_1.87.wav_ASR	and then cinderella
65-2_1970.219_0.31.wav_ASR	oh no
65-2_1970.547_6.69.wav_ASR	and it runs out of the place leaving a glass slipper one glass slipper behind
65-2_1978.161_9.82.wav_ASR	and and as she's being driven drive back home the the coach turned back into a pumpkin
65-2_1988.0_2.49.wav_ASR	and the the horse turned back into the mice
65-2_1990.617_5.26.wav_ASR	and the the footman back in the horse and her her her dog
65-2_1996.13_0.56.wav_ASR	remember well
65-2_1997.231_3.15.wav_ASR	and then still that it was over
65-2_2000.401_10.91.wav_ASR	and and then after the ball the the prince decided that there was only this cinderella that was interested in him
65-2_2012.653_3.04.wav_ASR	now nobody knew cinderella was and could not find her
65-2_2016.419_10.69.wav_ASR	and so he he put his advisor out to the task of of trying to locate cinderella with the glass slipper that that she left behind
65-2_2027.888_3.08.wav_ASR	and came to cinderella's house
65-2_2031.017_3.76.wav_ASR	the the stepsisters
65-2_2035.46_4.69.wav_ASR	and then but but turned out it did fit cinderella
65-2_2041.079_9.609.wav_ASR	and so so it ended up being that that cinderella and the prince got together and married lived happily ever after
65-2_2063.239_2.41.wav_ASR	we have two slices of bread
65-2_2066.402_6.391.wav_ASR	you get the peanut butter and jelly and have a knife or or a spoon
65-2_2073.536_1.341.wav_ASR	go lay out two pieces of bread
65-2_2075.728_3.94.wav_ASR	spread the peanut butter on one of the pieces of bread
65-2_2080.572_5.141.wav_ASR	and then you spread the jelly on the other piece of bread
65-2_2086.377_2.24.wav_ASR	and then you put the pieces of bread together
65-2_2088.635_2.25.wav_ASR	and there you have a peanut butter jelly sandwich
richardson16a_10.7_4.51.wav_ASR	stroke goes
richardson16a_17.87_12.8.wav_ASR	and i i i don't talk a lot since the stroke

tcu07a_147.708_0.39.wav_ASR	now
tcu07a_148.577_1.32.wav_ASR	it was all just
tcu07a_150.785_1.31.wav_ASR	now no no
tcu07a_152.727_1.77.wav_ASR	and i don't know
tcu07a_154.514_1.02.wav_ASR	oh now i think about it
tcu07a_155.555_8.91.wav_ASR	but i but made me realize that i can't
tcu07a_165.334_0.61.wav_ASR	don't remember
tcu07a_165.963_6.11.wav_ASR	well i just know that that started totally staying you know going in and
tcu07a_172.235_1.75.wav_ASR	they started dickie on me
tcu07a_174.0_3.31.wav_ASR	and i started certainly little bit
tcu07a_178.01_2.7.wav_ASR	but there were a lot of things like my name
tcu07a_180.919_4.97.wav_ASR	and i'm just now you know my name
tcu07a_185.908_1.85.wav_ASR	it's and that was it you know
tcu07a_187.777_1.06.wav_ASR	and then they never get it
tcu07a_189.134_2.56.wav_ASR	seven people they can get really that easy
tcu07a_192.031_0.89.wav_ASR	but me
tcu07a_200.296_0.34.wav_ASR	yes
tcu07a_200.964_6.82.wav_ASR	and and name and my name
tcu07a_208.7_5.2.wav_ASR	mean the other thing they wanna know is my
tcu07a_215.061_0.83.wav_ASR	don't remember
tcu07a_215.906_3.67.wav_ASR	and i can't remember a lot of things
tcu07a_219.6_1.14.wav_ASR	yes i guess it
tcu07a_221.351_6.26.wav_ASR	and so they just been every and then slowly slowly i've been slowly doing it
tcu07a_227.633_2.48.wav_ASR	and i mean really they've been
tcu07a_236.428_2.45.wav_ASR	and i don't know
tcu07a_239.174_1.82.wav_ASR	and i i think about it i don't know
tcu07a_241.134_0.35.wav_ASR	and i don't know
tcu07a_244.801_0.45.wav_ASR	okay
tcu07a_252.532_0.39.wav_ASR	it
tcu07a_252.946_1.09.wav_ASR	okay okay
tcu07a_261.678_10.64.wav_ASR	well they've been going to the
tcu07a_275.306_3.41.wav_ASR	and the
tcu07a_278.941_5.81.wav_ASR	they're out every every three days they help me
tcu07a_284.77_5.06.wav_ASR	and i mean there in the they save with the umbrella
tcu07a_289.849_2.0.wav_ASR	they i do the every
tcu07a_292.232_6.95.wav_ASR	every three days at the end
tcu07a_299.2_1.1.wav_ASR	and the hospital
tcu07a_300.459_2.54.wav_ASR	and my talk and talk it up peanu
tcu07a_303.189_9.4.wav_ASR	so i do find out feel that when i go with my band that helps them
tcu07a_312.787_1.43.wav_ASR	you know i find out
tcu07a_314.811_3.77.wav_ASR	and seems like every time i at little bit more you know
tcu07a_318.6_0.53.wav_ASR	so
tcu07a_320.674_0.42.wav_ASR	yes
tcu07a_322.153_0.55.wav_ASR	yeah
tcu07a_358.045_6.12.wav_ASR	and and the dance with them but i you know
tcu07a_365.261_1.33.wav_ASR	yeah the beginning
tcu07a_367.6_2.3.wav_ASR	but it's hard to think of the
tcu07a_370.3_3.58.wav_ASR	and i
tcu07a_374.981_1.26.wav_ASR	yeah probably
tcu07a_378.643_0.4.wav_ASR	now
tcu07a_386.09_0.55.wav_ASR	yeah
tcu07a_387.006_0.82.wav_ASR	that's a good one
tcu07a_390.512_0.62.wav_ASR	uhhuh
tcu07a_391.301_5.4.wav_ASR	he he gives me a lot of time
tcu07a_396.719_2.71.wav_ASR	and i mean he didn't have him
tcu07a_401.411_5.31.wav_ASR	but they kept a lot of time for me
tcu07a_408.237_4.18.wav_ASR	the the sky
tcu07a_413.77_2.46.wav_ASR	and i don't think what else i can talk kind of about
tcu07a_422.86_7.74.wav_ASR	well i don't know if i get him
tcu07a_431.851_1.14.wav_ASR	firstnamek and firstnameg
tcu07a_433.5_4.17.wav_ASR	it's it is hard to bend things
tcu07a_437.686_2.63.wav_ASR	and it's hard to talk a lot of things
tcu07a_440.368_3.96.wav_ASR	and i don't think who else can who can

tcu07a_464.828_0.52.wav_ASR	unhunh
tcu07a_465.853_0.65.wav_ASR	it's weird
tcu07a_473.491_1.459.wav_ASR	and i i kind of wonder you know
tcu07a_474.967_2.21.wav_ASR	and i'm remember it down
tcu07a_477.224_2.28.wav_ASR	fireman i know it

tcu07a_530.721_3.18.wav_ASR	and he was doing his dog i mean helped at home
tcu07a_535.111_2.87.wav_ASR	and he
tcu07a_538.17_2.34.wav_ASR	and and he ate
tcu07a_541.2_5.12.wav_ASR	he went has gotten his den
tcu07a_547.025_3.51.wav_ASR	he went out to the den
tcu07a_552.581_9.56.wav_ASR	and it drove drove and drove onto the dead here
tcu07a_563.166_6.88.wav_ASR	and and the
tcu07a_571.77_0.61.wav_ASR	galaxy
tcu07a_574.061_11.43.wav_ASR	the was gave gave gave it and found out what was going on
tcu07a_585.595_0.57.wav_ASR	now
tcu07a_591.788_0.35.wav_ASR	okay
tcu07a_601.0_0.36.wav_ASR	okay
tcu07a_602.696_0.46.wav_ASR	okay
tcu07a_603.992_8.79.wav_ASR	there was a mother and her her girl
tcu07a_615.423_20.75.wav_ASR	and he was telling her to take the girl to to the girl girl told him to hi hi take it
tcu07a_637.149_2.45.wav_ASR	and so
tcu07a_642.247_0.35.wav_ASR	and see
tcu07a_642.854_1.48.wav_ASR	well i don't need it
tcu07a_645.573_10.02.wav_ASR	and so he started to get got go
tcu07a_656.225_7.02.wav_ASR	and he started it and realized that he needed it
tcu07a_663.668_10.2.wav_ASR	so he got the things from mom
tcu07a_674.299_13.15.wav_ASR	and and now he got got a thing now
tcu07a_705.629_0.55.wav_ASR	okay
tcu07a_706.919_0.66.wav_ASR	and there's
tcu07a_709.213_4.84.wav_ASR	two he is dacking dacking
tcu07a_714.105_3.62.wav_ASR	mean he's walking walking
tcu07a_718.686_2.0.wav_ASR	and he is
tcu07a_722.226_6.54.wav_ASR	he was had his thing up
tcu07a_729.621_0.69.wav_ASR	and he fell
tcu07a_730.508_2.92.wav_ASR	more he's his thing
tcu07a_734.264_6.18.wav_ASR	and so no he's just up here in the by himself
tcu07a_741.603_4.92.wav_ASR	and so he somebody called
tcu07a_747.232_5.05.wav_ASR	and so now he's he at man is coming up
tcu07a_752.706_2.87.wav_ASR	and they're gonna get the
tcu07a_756.359_2.18.wav_ASR	and we did the thing up
tcu07a_759.12_5.13.wav_ASR	so he can make it down man
tcu07a_766.256_4.05.wav_ASR	but the reason even he was on here the
tcu07a_771.091_5.47.wav_ASR	was because i'm gone and found was helping help her
tcu07a_777.474_8.41.wav_ASR	with the dog and
tcu07a_786.29_0.77.wav_ASR	can't think of her
tcu07a_788.525_7.26.wav_ASR	and and that's howling the in anyway
tcu07a_796.339_5.59.wav_ASR	but it ended up being meant to be the one that was in
tcu07a_803.428_0.37.wav_ASR	okay
tcu07a_810.884_0.43.wav_ASR	yes
tcu07a_817.503_0.34.wav_ASR	now
tcu07a_822.929_1.62.wav_ASR	find yourself of the details
tcu07a_824.817_0.32.wav_ASR	uhhuh
tcu07a_829.258_0.31.wav_ASR	okay
tcu07a_832.777_0.33.wav_ASR	okay
tcu07a_923.902_0.54.wav_ASR	mkay
tcu07a_932.792_1.57.wav_ASR	okay
tcu07a_936.625_3.32.wav_ASR	and she was a
tcu07a_943.222_1.11.wav_ASR	and he
tcu07a_947.118_4.63.wav_ASR	see she was a
tcu07a_955.779_0.59.wav_ASR	oh i mean now
tcu07a_956.619_4.65.wav_ASR	he was
tcu07a_969.306_4.23.wav_ASR	and and anyway her her
tcu07a_974.209_3.69.wav_ASR	he did to be
tcu07a_978.898_11.55.wav_ASR	they were all three gonna go to the going to the
tcu07a_991.517_2.85.wav_ASR	it was a job
tcu07a_995.165_3.1.wav_ASR	and they wouldn't let her
tcu07a_999.781_0.87.wav_ASR	so they went
tcu07a_1001.665_2.88.wav_ASR	and and cinderella
tcu07a_1004.567_11.65.wav_ASR	and her this lady her mother was like a thing her mother
tcu07a_1016.234_0.87.wav_ASR	yeah mail
tcu07a_1017.905_4.8.wav_ASR	and so she did a thing on him
tcu07a_1023.107_4.01.wav_ASR	and and so he ran
tcu07a_1028.26_2.54.wav_ASR	and she could do it for so long
tcu07a_1031.136_3.36.wav_ASR	and and then he he hadta get him home
tcu07a_1034.922_4.78.wav_ASR	because he would be a fireman to go back into the
tcu07a_1040.481_1.68.wav_ASR	he would change
tcu07a_1043.239_4.609.wav_ASR	so after that he left her
tcu07a_1051.113_2.61.wav_ASR	he lost her thing behind
tcu07a_1054.499_2.85.wav_ASR	so he tied the bender
tcu07a_1058.294_7.77.wav_ASR	and they hadta take everybody
tcu07a_1066.532_4.0.wav_ASR	and he finally finally found found them
tcu07a_1070.549_1.74.wav_ASR	and she was the one
tcu07a_1072.994_5.63.wav_ASR	and they were in forever

thompson04a_489.984_0.8.wav_ASR	and you gotta do it
thompson04a_492.098_0.6.wav_ASR	oh okay
thompson04a_494.928_0.34.wav_ASR	well let's see
thompson04a_505.061_0.48.wav_ASR	what
thompson04a_511.001_1.49.wav_ASR	well i got lots of those
thompson04a_514.072_4.77.wav_ASR	and i like them all
thompson04a_520.23_0.61.wav_ASR	yeah
thompson04a_521.855_0.49.wav_ASR	yeah
thompson04a_523.121_0.73.wav_ASR	probably
thompson04a_526.29_10.82.wav_ASR	the end end no see engine
thompson04a_538.978_4.14.wav_ASR	oh
thompson04a_544.486_0.78.wav_ASR	that's what it is
thompson04a_545.343_1.02.wav_ASR	that's what it is
thompson04a_547.259_5.14.wav_ASR	oh one two three four five six seven
thompson04a_553.999_0.56.wav_ASR	eight
thompson04a_556.035_5.43.wav_ASR	oh i'll look
thompson04a_566.895_0.53.wav_ASR	obtained
thompson04a_568.405_0.57.wav_ASR	yeah
thompson04a_569.401_0.9.wav_ASR	and that was right
thompson04a_573.076_1.59.wav_ASR	so that's what we did all the time
thompson04a_580.365_2.42.wav_ASR	we did a lot of things
thompson04a_582.994_2.22.wav_ASR	we really did lots of what
thompson04a_585.618_0.47.wav_ASR	we did
thompson04a_587.656_1.85.wav_ASR	and we had good tips
thompson04a_625.168_6.19.wav_ASR	well foottoes is is a ball
thompson04a_632.063_10.18.wav_ASR	and it's shoes
thompson04a_645.671_1.2.wav_ASR	that's that's not one
thompson04a_647.082_1.51.wav_ASR	should be right right
thompson04a_648.774_1.69.wav_ASR	yeah right
thompson04a_651.582_1.04.wav_ASR	but that's what he says
thompson04a_652.643_2.25.wav_ASR	and he's going to go over to the window
thompson04a_655.361_8.78.wav_ASR	and then from then it goes back into the but
thompson04a_664.827_1.97.wav_ASR	well i say yes
thompson04a_667.577_2.7.wav_ASR	and the peanut butter it's coming back here
thompson04a_670.524_1.18.wav_ASR	and then i
thompson04a_671.933_5.95.wav_ASR	and this is where he is exactly with the ball
thompson04a_678.822_4.29.wav_ASR	and right here on his things
thompson04a_683.506_0.58.wav_ASR	that's the
thompson04a_685.979_1.15.wav_ASR	isn't that wonderful
thompson04a_689.329_0.47.wav_ASR	oh no
thompson04a_690.252_0.68.wav_ASR	never but
thompson04a_690.951_0.73.wav_ASR	it's alright
thompson04a_718.06_5.55.wav_ASR	oh well then when she's done now is her her umbrella
thompson04a_723.947_1.69.wav_ASR	and she's going here
thompson04a_725.814_1.36.wav_ASR	call him to go that
thompson04a_727.275_1.5.wav_ASR	and we tell him
thompson04a_728.934_1.61.wav_ASR	yes or i'm just right here
thompson04a_730.629_3.16.wav_ASR	you don't really need it but i'll have it anyway
thompson04a_733.866_1.23.wav_ASR	so they're going to do
thompson04a_735.374_2.04.wav_ASR	and now oh boy
thompson04a_737.915_20.01.wav_ASR	here is the umbrella or the rain
thompson04a_759.78_2.56.wav_ASR	and now now they're really back
thompson04a_762.358_4.75.wav_ASR	the boy is up from this one to this one
thompson04a_769.393_0.93.wav_ASR	and so he is
thompson04a_770.372_0.9.wav_ASR	the back
thompson04a_771.668_0.5.wav_ASR	oh i
thompson04a_772.85_3.03.wav_ASR	he was told you know he knew that he wasn't going to do it
thompson04a_776.376_1.28.wav_ASR	and that's what he did
thompson04a_777.764_3.69.wav_ASR	and now the this time he's back with with them

UCL02a_77.532_0.76.wav_ASR	it's hard to tell
UCL02a_78.308_2.25.wav_ASR	sometimes suddenly one day he can be perfect
UCL02a_81.517_1.77.wav_ASR	well not perfect i mean but it is decent
UCL02a_83.309_5.47.wav_ASR	and sometimes it's i just can't hear something you know
UCL02a_88.8_1.82.wav_ASR	that's a difficult thing when with the speech
UCL02a_92.492_4.69.wav_ASR	and then i told her sometimes it's it's okay
UCL02a_97.24_3.13.wav_ASR	and then of course suddenly one word is just disappearing from me as well
UCL02a_100.812_1.34.wav_ASR	well i'm sorry to hear that
UCL02a_102.173_0.54.wav_ASR	that's okay
UCL02a_103.893_3.39.wav_ASR	and then suddenly one word is brilliant for speaking to to speak everybody
UCL02a_107.33_0.65.wav_ASR	it's good for me
UCL02a_108.7_2.11.wav_ASR	and then suddenly just made me so tired
UCL02a_111.006_1.62.wav_ASR	well not tired but then i just kinda
UCL02a_112.82_1.55.wav_ASR	it's difficult to tell you know
UCL02a_115.317_8.88.wav_ASR	yeah one i talk about it well
UCL02a_124.218_1.15.wav_ASR	so many things about me is well
UCL02a_125.597_8.35.wav_ASR	many times about my speech and everybody
UCL02a_134.03_3.34.wav_ASR	sometimes it's brilliant
UCL02a_137.419_4.91.wav_ASR	when people are talking to me and then i guess that what they're talking to me is
UCL02a_142.345_3.14.wav_ASR	and i think maybe one little word is has disappeared from me now
UCL02a_146.052_0.98.wav_ASR	one word just gone
UCL02a_147.699_2.65.wav_ASR	and then sometimes it's me just terrible when i can't hear anything
UCL02a_151.038_4.42.wav_ASR	it was a knife
UCL02a_155.949_12.23.wav_ASR	sometimes the bad thing is sometimes you you i can't do anything for me
UCL02a_168.2_1.91.wav_ASR	that's that's big and making a figure something
UCL02a_171.11_1.02.wav_ASR	it's very difficult for me
UCL02a_172.344_1.12.wav_ASR	if he's difficult sometimes
UCL02a_173.565_1.16.wav_ASR	and when you really bad with it
UCL02a_175.216_2.16.wav_ASR	you can't speak to my
UCL02a_177.398_0.78.wav_ASR	what happened to me
UCL02a_178.199_1.64.wav_ASR	and that's very difficult or something like that
UCL02a_180.635_5.7.wav_ASR	and you get rushing rushing
UCL02a_186.35_0.66.wav_ASR	and i'm saying the yeah
UCL02a_187.33_0.32.wav_ASR	oh yes
UCL02a_188.404_3.4.wav_ASR	well that can be terrible sometimes
UCL02a_192.01_4.9.wav_ASR	sometimes like
UCL02a_198.705_2.08.wav_ASR	divided for me about what's going about speaking as well
UCL02a_200.83_1.55.wav_ASR	so i had no reading books
UCL02a_202.4_2.79.wav_ASR	so i useta read a lot of things you know before i did my stroke obviously
UCL02a_205.21_1.04.wav_ASR	but i read a lot of books
UCL02a_206.693_3.1.wav_ASR	now it's difficult for me is when i speaking about my books to me
UCL02a_210.781_7.56.wav_ASR	and and the awful thing for me is sometimes i'm reading some my books about two pages in me and then i can't remember what i'm talking about
UCL02a_218.619_3.13.wav_ASR	the half the pages are reading about and then suddenly
UCL02a_222.2_2.17.wav_ASR	yes that's brilliant for what i'm reading about that
UCL02a_224.65_1.38.wav_ASR	and then suddenly one brain hurts
UCL02a_226.05_0.43.wav_ASR	just gone
UCL02a_226.69_0.88.wav_ASR	it's terrible as well
UCL02a_228.468_4.2.wav_ASR	so many times when i'm reading again and i'm talking about the time before
UCL02a_232.729_1.01.wav_ASR	well the terrible you know
UCL02a_234.485_8.7.wav_ASR	yeah and i'm watching films and things like that for me as well
UCL02a_243.916_13.13.wav_ASR	well watching films or devi devi devi sometimes i hafta watch everything to subtitles
UCL02a_258.261_9.22.wav_ASR	that's hasta be as well like subtitles and i i the next day again or something like that
UCL02a_268.09_0.94.wav_ASR	so the things are again
UCL02a_269.046_0.67.wav_ASR	that's quite good
UCL02a_270.468_3.7.wav_ASR	because i can't what they're talking about with a phone
UCL02a_274.691_5.27.wav_ASR	stepdaughters are really good for me really are good things as well
UCL02a_282.717_3.23.wav_ASR	and then of course what happened to me with my stroke as well
UCL02a_285.97_2.58.wav_ASR	of course you know i did a lot with the catholic music
UCL02a_288.565_1.94.wav_ASR	that was the circuit si
UCL02a_292.355_5.18.wav_ASR	that's the all the classical music place
UCL02a_297.553_2.03.wav_ASR	so i was living up in germany and spain and things like that
UCL02a_299.599_4.57.wav_ASR	that's one of the things i was doing is the management of all the customer with me is there
UCL02a_305.791_4.38.wav_ASR	at least my my personal music is there thanks god
UCL02a_311.267_2.23.wav_ASR	but strange enough then happened to me
UCL02a_314.212_3.28.wav_ASR	and i can hear the words perfectly about it
UCL02a_317.508_1.67.wav_ASR	all the sound of the music is that
UCL02a_319.2_1.21.wav_ASR	and i can hear everything perfectly
UCL02a_320.824_0.96.wav_ASR	and then sometime i remember
UCL02a_322.053_0.66.wav_ASR	yeah it's that
UCL02a_323.079_2.0.wav_ASR	well i i can hear that music is
UCL02a_325.1_0.75.wav_ASR	and i can hear it as well
UCL02a_326.28_0.58.wav_ASR	but i don't say
UCL02a_327.06_3.92.wav_ASR	it was a bit of like you know it was a baltimore and that that
UCL02a_331.0_0.95.wav_ASR	and i can see what happened
UCL02a_332.315_0.63.wav_ASR	and then suddenly
UCL02a_333.511_1.24.wav_ASR	oh yeah what was it that big
UCL02a_334.876_1.23.wav_ASR	it was the peanut butter's place
UCL02a_336.218_1.82.wav_ASR	that's sunny one word it just gone for me
UCL02a_339.028_2.35.wav_ASR	you hafta get a pencil about it
UCL02a_341.4_0.32.wav_ASR	oh i think
UCL02a_341.803_0.93.wav_ASR	and that's what is my name
UCL02a_342.829_1.91.wav_ASR	you know i can remember the word up here is there
UCL02a_344.964_0.93.wav_ASR	can't have all of it
UCL02a_347.417_4.47.wav_ASR	but the classical music is wellthank god for me as well
UCL02a_351.907_3.12.wav_ASR	and my music there as well as you know
UCL02a_355.5_1.15.wav_ASR	but singing just now
UCL02a_357.482_1.78.wav_ASR	and reading the books can be difficult for me
UCL02a_360.193_2.99.wav_ASR	the films i need the subtitles
UCL02a_363.263_3.04.wav_ASR	but then with the music it's brilliant thanks god i mean you know
UCL02a_367.126_5.98.wav_ASR	many things happened with me and my aphasia and things like that a couple of people is well
UCL02a_373.127_1.85.wav_ASR	and i've been out with a pretty good as well
UCL02a_374.999_1.1.wav_ASR	well that helps people is well
UCL02a_376.116_0.31.wav_ASR	who is it
UCL02a_376.48_0.38.wav_ASR	and the guy
UCL02a_377.882_5.1.wav_ASR	and i don't know if i can make it
UCL02a_383.006_1.68.wav_ASR	well this is a little thing as well you know
UCL02a_384.93_2.72.wav_ASR	some little things but what i do
UCL02a_388.125_1.06.wav_ASR	yes about it
UCL02a_394.094_1.97.wav_ASR	that happened on the actual day that happened to me yes
UCL02a_397.44_1.06.wav_ASR	what happened
UCL02a_399.855_1.57.wav_ASR	well that was in the oldest
UCL02a_402.334_3.75.wav_ASR	that's the twenty year the fifteenth yeah
UCL02a_407.543_0.84.wav_ASR	twenty the fifties
UCL02a_408.4_1.08.wav_ASR	yes it's making sense today yes
UCL02a_409.58_2.56.wav_ASR	that's the worst four four years ago
UCL02a_414.5_2.34.wav_ASR	yes i suppose it what i really remember is just strange
UCL02a_416.862_0.77.wav_ASR	and he was in the elevator
UCL02a_417.65_1.01.wav_ASR	and i got to work
UCL02a_419.58_2.06.wav_ASR	and it's about nine thirty in the morning
UCL02a_422.308_1.74.wav_ASR	off fish is in the tube
UCL02a_424.068_1.71.wav_ASR	and then i's gonna catch my bus
UCL02a_427.382_1.25.wav_ASR	and they got there into work
UCL02a_429.05_1.69.wav_ASR	and i remember it was really strange
UCL02a_432.378_3.07.wav_ASR	and i was gonna go onto my computer
UCL02a_436.506_0.97.wav_ASR	and then suddenly
UCL02a_437.5_2.4.wav_ASR	yeah that's what i'm supposed to do with my computer software
UCL02a_440.439_4.99.wav_ASR	and i couldn't remember what is how to use my computer
UCL02a_445.929_3.87.wav_ASR	what's my my my code you know you're writing things
UCL02a_450.603_0.68.wav_ASR	come on why is it
UCL02a_451.3_1.04.wav_ASR	can i have it
UCL02a_452.404_0.36.wav_ASR	so
UCL02a_454.288_1.27.wav_ASR	that's my kitty
UCL02a_455.628_0.46.wav_ASR	and i said
UCL02a_456.246_7.3.wav_ASR	and firstnameh i'm not gonna remember how to use my computer and things like that
UCL02a_464.158_1.26.wav_ASR	and then she suddenly noticed
UCL02a_465.465_2.41.wav_ASR	and she said to me i wasn't a bit strange to him as well
UCL02a_468.953_0.57.wav_ASR	and the mother says
UCL02a_470.161_1.38.wav_ASR	okay and that
UCL02a_471.8_0.6.wav_ASR	when i thought
UCL02a_474.207_0.79.wav_ASR	it was fine for me
UCL02a_475.017_1.76.wav_ASR	and walking around and things like that you know
UCL02a_476.8_2.11.wav_ASR	it's still my brain is
UCL02a_480.117_4.99.wav_ASR	well i just couldn't remember what computer was and going downstairs and things like that and that
UCL02a_485.795_3.66.wav_ASR	and suddenly some friends were talking to me and they were talking to me
UCL02a_489.477_2.9.wav_ASR	and i couldn't what they were talking to me
UCL02a_494.892_2.06.wav_ASR	and then a friend of mine firstnamel and she said
UCL02a_497.05_1.56.wav_ASR	oh yeah and i'm gonna get you sort of as well
UCL02a_499.0_1.51.wav_ASR	and she called
UCL02a_501.025_2.43.wav_ASR	yes but nine o'clock in the morning
UCL02a_503.787_2.13.wav_ASR	and we'll take off to the hospital and eat
UCL02a_507.338_1.89.wav_ASR	and i sat there for a couple of times as well
UCL02a_509.25_2.01.wav_ASR	and then they kidding for me for about a hour
UCL02a_512.02_0.421.wav_ASR	and sat down
UCL02a_512.456_1.29.wav_ASR	and the girl is talking to him
UCL02a_513.77_1.31.wav_ASR	and the same other people and
UCL02a_516.39_1.49.wav_ASR	and then the movie you go was
UCL02a_517.899_1.26.wav_ASR	and then i couldn't speak to anyone
UCL02a_519.178_1.81.wav_ASR	yeah it's a broad broad broad broad broad
UCL02a_522.583_7.091.wav_ASR	in hospital there's all sort of things to was see like that and things to me
UCL02a_530.449_1.74.wav_ASR	and i couldn't speak to her
UCL02a_533.17_0.79.wav_ASR	and i couldn't speak
UCL02a_534.844_2.64.wav_ASR	when people were talking to me i couldn't what they were doing to me
UCL02a_537.5_1.32.wav_ASR	okay one word yes
UCL02a_539.744_1.17.wav_ASR	nothing was gone
UCL02a_542.169_5.25.wav_ASR	yes i was here
UCL02a_547.468_1.91.wav_ASR	and about this ten the evening as well
UCL02a_549.43_5.87.wav_ASR	so then yeah it north north middlesex the first day is well
UCL02a_555.32_1.53.wav_ASR	and then i said after that was about
UCL02a_557.638_2.43.wav_ASR	there's a five or six day hours
UCL02a_560.666_2.74.wav_ASR	and they moved me from there down here to ul cl yeah
UCL02a_564.353_1.74.wav_ASR	it was the hospital
UCL02a_568.078_5.12.wav_ASR	and and that was it as well
UCL02a_573.219_1.35.wav_ASR	oh yeah i mean you know
UCL02a_575.827_0.89.wav_ASR	well i remember after that
UCL02a_576.741_1.01.wav_ASR	is it about five hours
UCL02a_577.773_1.11.wav_ASR	and this is big
UCL02a_579.236_0.55.wav_ASR	and i'm going up
UCL02a_579.81_3.71.wav_ASR	it was quite in the evening as well in the hospital
UCL02a_584.84_3.59.wav_ASR	and the doctors and trying to write for me as well
UCL02a_588.451_4.45.wav_ASR	and it could be that my speech was even worse that very evening time as well
UCL02a_593.524_2.64.wav_ASR	and the next day is well i just couldn't speak to anybody
UCL02a_597.058_3.09.wav_ASR	and all the hospitals were there and looking at me and other people up there
UCL02a_600.25_1.04.wav_ASR	and i couldn't
UCL02a_602.917_2.26.wav_ASR	and i think i remember now
UCL02a_605.262_2.6.wav_ASR	the first day of him
UCL02a_608.048_0.74.wav_ASR	just open the jar
UCL02a_608.959_0.82.wav_ASR	it was terrible
UCL02a_609.799_0.88.wav_ASR	well i couldn't speak
UCL02a_610.7_0.75.wav_ASR	well people looking at me
UCL02a_611.467_0.48.wav_ASR	and i was looking
UCL02a_613.201_2.54.wav_ASR	when people were talking to me
UCL02a_615.795_4.6.wav_ASR	and i couldn't when they had talked to me i couldn't speak to anything
UCL02a_620.505_0.55.wav_ASR	stroke
UCL02a_621.961_1.52.wav_ASR	yeah that's the writing down
UCL02a_624.359_1.26.wav_ASR	the doctor say that that
UCL02a_625.666_1.39.wav_ASR	and i couldn't speak anything as well
UCL02a_628.52_4.16.wav_ASR	that's the worst thing for about about three or four weeks
UCL02a_632.699_1.28.wav_ASR	well i remember it was
UCL02a_634.0_2.21.wav_ASR	well everybody's staying around at that
UCL02a_637.869_2.91.wav_ASR	and then after that as well
UCL02a_640.8_0.48.wav_ASR	so yes
UCL02a_641.3_2.15.wav_ASR	so firstnamem is ul rl placing here
UCL02a_644.103_1.81.wav_ASR	and then this place just the recording from here
UCL02a_646.0_0.38.wav_ASR	what's it
UCL02a_646.4_5.93.wav_ASR	the queen queen queen square
UCL02a_652.975_4.0.wav_ASR	the neurosurgeon neurologist you know
UCL02a_657.478_1.21.wav_ASR	is that for two weeks as well
UCL02a_659.32_1.48.wav_ASR	and they tested him and didn't
UCL02a_661.705_2.51.wav_ASR	so that that's i mean it's not being today
UCL02a_664.318_1.87.wav_ASR	that's the first day that happened on the first stroke yeah
UCL02a_675.556_1.58.wav_ASR	that's like getting any better yeah
UCL02a_677.863_3.8.wav_ASR	it's strange
UCL02a_681.681_3.38.wav_ASR	it was the next thing for me i was sposta be two weeks after
UCL02a_685.08_1.4.wav_ASR	oh the first you know
UCL02a_686.5_1.06.wav_ASR	well now i can think of it
UCL02a_687.622_3.32.wav_ASR	and then two executive the neuro neurologist
UCL02a_691.037_1.37.wav_ASR	how can i speak the first word is well
UCL02a_693.677_2.17.wav_ASR	and i remember that was the first one about two years
UCL02a_695.871_6.85.wav_ASR	and then there's some people were testing me up for the video
UCL02a_704.304_2.18.wav_ASR	and somebody was doctor
UCL02a_706.5_3.48.wav_ASR	there's a lot of tests and things like that and v i d
UCL02a_712.938_1.25.wav_ASR	and she's been test me
UCL02a_714.208_1.77.wav_ASR	and you know these photographs of me
UCL02a_716.0_3.65.wav_ASR	and are these cats
UCL02a_719.666_1.46.wav_ASR	the dogs and things like that
UCL02a_721.149_1.73.wav_ASR	and what's this and some other things for me
UCL02a_723.85_4.47.wav_ASR	and sometimes i couldn't what she was talking about
UCL02a_728.336_1.86.wav_ASR	and he's just said you like the photo thing
UCL02a_730.212_3.77.wav_ASR	there's a dog or you know square things and that kind of thing
UCL02a_738.114_2.95.wav_ASR	then after that about two weeks another place
UCL02a_741.126_4.6.wav_ASR	and then that was called the stroke community people is well
UCL02a_747.398_2.78.wav_ASR	and the other thing was then one group of people helping up
UCL02a_750.539_5.96.wav_ASR	stroke community people helping people for writing some words to me as well
UCL02a_757.561_3.75.wav_ASR	helping me some words and me
UCL02a_761.331_3.15.wav_ASR	you know it's in monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday saturday
UCL02a_764.5_1.42.wav_ASR	the first days i couldn't tell her
UCL02a_766.211_2.02.wav_ASR	is in monday tuesday when they said the friday
UCL02a_768.626_0.55.wav_ASR	and i couldn't remember
UCL02a_769.252_0.9.wav_ASR	it's in monday to the end
UCL02a_770.176_1.63.wav_ASR	and i couldn't speak the word like monday
UCL02a_772.961_6.7.wav_ASR	it's the first day seventh seventh third fourth fifth sixth
UCL02a_779.679_0.83.wav_ASR	and then i couldn't
UCL02a_781.953_1.63.wav_ASR	and i still know people like that now
UCL02a_783.712_1.47.wav_ASR	is one two three four five six seven
UCL02a_785.2_1.08.wav_ASR	maybe not double checked or something
UCL02a_786.37_3.78.wav_ASR	but at the first time i was told he's i couldn't speak up
UCL02a_790.171_3.41.wav_ASR	you know what days
UCL02a_793.6_0.79.wav_ASR	well how am i
UCL02a_795.524_1.21.wav_ASR	well you were my going
UCL02a_796.901_1.38.wav_ASR	and i couldn't write what things are again
UCL02a_799.104_2.08.wav_ASR	that was difficult for me as well you know
UCL02a_801.24_3.72.wav_ASR	there was some people i suppose for is about
UCL02a_806.4_3.15.wav_ASR	it was about six months she was there
UCL02a_810.46_2.21.wav_ASR	every week for me somebody was talking to me
UCL02a_812.693_6.05.wav_ASR	and you know reaching some words and helping out that that
UCL02a_818.791_1.44.wav_ASR	well i suppose that's about two weeks
UCL02a_821.718_4.68.wav_ASR	and then after that i sposta see me
UCL02a_826.419_1.74.wav_ASR	it was three weeks and then
UCL02a_828.767_2.69.wav_ASR	mid six weeks or nine weeks yes
UCL02a_832.093_7.38.wav_ASR	and then after nine months and then with you at ul rl at aphasia computer
UCL02a_840.063_1.49.wav_ASR	that was the first test as well
UCL02a_841.662_2.74.wav_ASR	and i suppose that was the
UCL02a_845.928_4.83.wav_ASR	think for me first i you know with a stroke and the stroke people already i can walk around
UCL02a_850.827_3.82.wav_ASR	and then though this is a big problem for me is you know and things like that
UCL02a_854.716_0.61.wav_ASR	that's okay
UCL02a_856.337_3.78.wav_ASR	you know by the bus and the tube and things like that
UCL02a_860.14_0.69.wav_ASR	well it's fine
UCL02a_861.098_3.8.wav_ASR	and i kinda panic about that you know about the shoe by myself
UCL02a_865.175_1.64.wav_ASR	and not being to help people as well
UCL02a_867.837_2.54.wav_ASR	that's a word for me
UCL02a_870.4_4.58.wav_ASR	and i think it was strange of other people that were with aphasia
UCL02a_875.2_1.96.wav_ASR	if you're by yourself with a panic
UCL02a_877.224_0.68.wav_ASR	well he's kinda happy
UCL02a_878.342_1.19.wav_ASR	and it's gonna happen
UCL02a_881.28_2.41.wav_ASR	can be worried for me sometimes
UCL02a_883.763_1.66.wav_ASR	well not much better than now
UCL02a_885.443_1.45.wav_ASR	but it can be terrible you know
UCL02a_887.833_4.93.wav_ASR	and i'm talking about now to other people you know
UCL02a_893.03_5.1.wav_ASR	but i suppose afterwards that is better for me now
UCL02a_898.696_6.84.wav_ASR	but yeah physically you walking around
UCL02a_905.56_0.96.wav_ASR	that's fine for me
UCL02a_907.365_2.52.wav_ASR	but it just you know is my own brain thing as well
UCL02a_909.992_0.51.wav_ASR	and that we go
UCL02a_911.188_1.79.wav_ASR	so i'm making sense you know
UCL02a_940.576_0.67.wav_ASR	so i went to the
UCL02a_941.493_0.61.wav_ASR	just saying again
UCL02a_942.392_1.14.wav_ASR	how to say okay
UCL02a_948.585_0.9.wav_ASR	why is the little kid
UCL02a_955.002_2.69.wav_ASR	one of us is a key and one of us said
UCL02a_966.107_3.03.wav_ASR	and then what do really happened to me yes
UCL02a_971.144_7.25.wav_ASR	isn't making any sense to you know what what what was happening to me as a kid or yeah
UCL02a_978.444_0.75.wav_ASR	well sorry to get yes
UCL02a_979.633_2.56.wav_ASR	took me me speaking the language and things like that all now
UCL02a_986.138_3.38.wav_ASR	yeah and everything is strange or the kind of days as well
UCL02a_989.538_1.6.wav_ASR	well now i'm fifty eight
UCL02a_992.535_2.48.wav_ASR	but i was a kid i was lucky when i was kicked
UCL02a_995.033_0.71.wav_ASR	he's strange is well
UCL02a_995.761_5.8.wav_ASR	mean i was about ten ten to thirteen thirteen years is a kid
UCL02a_1002.376_7.93.wav_ASR	and i was lucky because i was living in in naples early as a kid
UCL02a_1010.322_6.55.wav_ASR	and i was a boarding school in england as well but my dad had his job out in italy as well
UCL02a_1017.003_0.78.wav_ASR	how do i be back there as well
UCL02a_1018.974_1.8.wav_ASR	but it's strange you're talking about that thing's happy as well
UCL02a_1020.913_2.78.wav_ASR	but i remember i remember that was
UCL02a_1024.459_3.88.wav_ASR	they also lived in germany for about you know five years as well but then back to germany
UCL02a_1029.03_3.799.wav_ASR	and then off it goes back to earthy as well
UCL02a_1033.867_3.061.wav_ASR	and it's strange to is strange the days
UCL02a_1038.126_1.02.wav_ASR	it is wonderful
UCL02a_1039.807_0.56.wav_ASR	is a key
UCL02a_1040.387_2.99.wav_ASR	we lived in naples just outside of naples
UCL02a_1044.069_3.01.wav_ASR	we hadta use from the
UCL02a_1047.13_2.44.wav_ASR	from where i was the difference she could see
UCL02a_1053.355_0.79.wav_ASR	vegas
UCL02a_1054.307_0.36.wav_ASR	okay
UCL02a_1055.824_2.03.wav_ASR	vl ul sl
UCL02a_1058.851_0.67.wav_ASR	you know all that thing
UCL02a_1060.129_0.32.wav_ASR	mkay
UCL02a_1061.36_1.67.wav_ASR	vegas vegas
UCL02a_1063.289_0.95.wav_ASR	it cost me the word is
UCL02a_1064.257_1.25.wav_ASR	you know the big boy is

UCL02a_1294.873_1.09.wav_ASR	don't wanna speak to me now
UCL02a_1305.334_0.85.wav_ASR	okay right good morning
UCL02a_1306.2_3.5.wav_ASR	was a young kid a little young kid
UCL02a_1309.751_1.54.wav_ASR	and he's playing with his football
UCL02a_1311.308_7.67.wav_ASR	he was out in the garden another garden garden
UCL02a_1319.06_0.68.wav_ASR	to be a kid

UCL02a_1335.475_4.96.wav_ASR	and he's hit a hole in his window
UCL02a_1340.882_4.03.wav_ASR	is it when the glass is broken because he's smashed into his his football
UCL02a_1346.475_4.81.wav_ASR	then his neighbor is then was actually the same into his house
UCL02a_1352.128_1.17.wav_ASR	his neighbor was sitting down
UCL02a_1353.343_7.07.wav_ASR	and suddenly he could see that his foot was smashed into his glass and the window
UCL02a_1361.897_3.71.wav_ASR	so that was his neighbor
UCL02a_1368.491_8.22.wav_ASR	and the girl's shouldn't see that he's just seen that he's can see that someone has smashed into his window

UCL02a_1619.809_1.47.wav_ASR	umbrella umbrella
UCL02a_1621.474_1.83.wav_ASR	and i only think the spanish was as well as now
UCL02a_1624.323_1.51.wav_ASR	well i was so good about the spanish
UCL02a_1625.854_0.58.wav_ASR	well lemme think
UCL02a_1626.911_1.15.wav_ASR	so it's difficult
UCL02a_1629.167_0.95.wav_ASR	and i thought difficult
UCL02a_1631.164_1.42.wav_ASR	so anyway one word i just couldn't remember
UCL02a_1660.531_1.79.wav_ASR	for just tell you what's been happening now yeah
UCL02a_1671.515_0.47.wav_ASR	computer
UCL02a_1672.334_0.67.wav_ASR	so much happy
UCL02a_1673.054_4.99.wav_ASR	well one of those little things is
UCL02a_1678.595_1.87.wav_ASR	everything is somebody's all the time is all
UCL02a_1681.017_1.0.wav_ASR	okay right with her
UCL02a_1682.541_6.58.wav_ASR	the first of all that a little pupscat is out in the up in the tree in the top part of the tree
UCL02a_1690.202_4.11.wav_ASR	there's a little baby cat in the tree and can get to sleep
UCL02a_1694.327_9.2.wav_ASR	and and the cat cannot get into the tree because the cat is in the tree in camden where
UCL02a_1703.696_1.84.wav_ASR	and the little baby can see the cat there
UCL02a_1705.555_3.09.wav_ASR	and she's help help her because the cat's getting to sleep as well
UCL02a_1710.048_8.58.wav_ASR	little baby kids is a baby girl she's going out with her a tricycle
UCL02a_1719.566_0.85.wav_ASR	how come in the word now
UCL02a_1723.364_0.76.wav_ASR	is the guy up there
UCL02a_1724.26_1.49.wav_ASR	think the some guy's be helping up
UCL02a_1726.06_7.38.wav_ASR	he's he was going to help this guy this man is gonna help with the cat
UCL02a_1735.207_4.01.wav_ASR	and the mom was gonna help the cat out of the tree
UCL02a_1739.86_3.97.wav_ASR	but then there's a big dog but he's making a noise
UCL02a_1744.072_2.85.wav_ASR	he's he's scared for all the guy outside
UCL02a_1748.204_1.99.wav_ASR	the man is up there trying to help with the cat
UCL02a_1751.24_6.61.wav_ASR	but the other big dog is making a a big problem for us
UCL02a_1759.276_15.77.wav_ASR	and top of him as well i imagine he's helped to the
UCL02a_1775.511_1.42.wav_ASR	the word's kind of
UCL02a_1779.96_5.2.wav_ASR	and
UCL02a_1787.629_1.09.wav_ASR	all these kids
UCL02a_1789.188_6.61.wav_ASR	and i'm going to lie down
UCL02a_1795.817_0.59.wav_ASR	and i thought
UCL02a_1798.365_1.05.wav_ASR	well these young people is well
UCL02a_1800.445_6.73.wav_ASR	with the yellow people was gonna help them when they got a problem with it
UCL02a_1808.09_0.81.wav_ASR	well the hour
UCL02a_1809.637_0.71.wav_ASR	cut it in half
UCL02a_1810.4_0.33.wav_ASR	what's her name
UCL02a_1813.715_0.45.wav_ASR	oh well
UCL02a_1814.315_3.93.wav_ASR	well there's a lot hurting today is like a little baby girl
UCL02a_1818.266_3.66.wav_ASR	and she's lost where her cats in very top of the tree and can't move away
UCL02a_1822.322_4.06.wav_ASR	the mom was gonna help the cat getting out of the tree
UCL02a_1826.967_6.29.wav_ASR	my big dog is barking and making the man in front of them scared about him all
UCL02a_1834.028_2.73.wav_ASR	he's lost her
UCL02a_1837.122_0.94.wav_ASR	come but there's no
UCL02a_1838.587_1.15.wav_ASR	and i don't remember that as well
UCL02a_1841.049_1.1.wav_ASR	and my brain
UCL02a_1842.585_1.87.wav_ASR	can't think at all what they're doing about it
UCL02a_1853.342_0.91.wav_ASR	so it's fine
UCL02a_1855.108_0.31.wav_ASR	it's a girl
UCL02a_1855.54_0.88.wav_ASR	oh i can't

williamson14b_676.799_3.41.wav_ASR	and the wife was staying at home
williamson14b_681.131_8.97.wav_ASR	and the firstnamemi beautiful daughter was in the ball
williamson14b_692.195_7.59.wav_ASR	and but the fairy godmother said
williamson14b_701.684_0.96.wav_ASR	and the pumpkin
williamson14b_703.542_0.86.wav_ASR	and i said
williamson14b_704.519_3.35.wav_ASR	you're going to the the the ball
williamson14b_709.28_3.02.wav_ASR	so we dressed her up
williamson14b_713.72_1.57.wav_ASR	and it was a beautiful place
williamson14b_716.572_2.52.wav_ASR	and he stopped the dancing
williamson14b_720.042_3.19.wav_ASR	and the princess stepped there
williamson14b_724.086_1.33.wav_ASR	and it too hit it off
williamson14b_726.718_21.63.wav_ASR	so but now at at twelve thirty he the pumpkin was there
williamson14b_748.729_7.69.wav_ASR	but and he changed it to the white horse to a the mice
williamson14b_757.621_9.63.wav_ASR	and and he he tear out the and and the shoe
williamson14b_769.62_5.48.wav_ASR	so he was concerned about he was taking back about the wife
williamson14b_775.983_3.85.wav_ASR	and then the cinderella
williamson14b_781.32_1.35.wav_ASR	so he said
williamson14b_783.562_0.73.wav_ASR	and it was a shoe
williamson14b_786.17_1.28.wav_ASR	where is the shoe
williamson14b_789.337_12.67.wav_ASR	so i think that was the the the not the the prince but the executive
williamson14b_802.032_4.61.wav_ASR	well i don't know what the hell it is but it's
williamson14b_807.41_1.07.wav_ASR	and he goes around
williamson14b_808.55_4.17.wav_ASR	and and he it was the one the slipper
williamson14b_814.419_0.66.wav_ASR	so he found it
williamson14b_815.879_0.86.wav_ASR	and that's the end
williamson14b_829.716_5.57.wav_ASR	well there's a two piece of bread
williamson14b_837.105_2.76.wav_ASR	open the the cell phone
williamson14b_841.519_2.78.wav_ASR	and two pieces of bread
williamson14b_847.059_12.67.wav_ASR	and one the bread and the other the bottom was the bread
williamson14b_860.221_4.83.wav_ASR	and the the dishes i mean the the plate was there
williamson14b_867.227_10.49.wav_ASR	so he the peanut butter and jelly and the peanut was the jar
williamson14b_879.138_1.62.wav_ASR	and he the dance
williamson14b_881.397_6.09.wav_ASR	and you and the peanut butter and jelly and
williamson14b_887.509_0.62.wav_ASR	and i shot
williamson14b_888.286_21.9.wav_ASR	and the the the cover
williamson14b_910.888_10.49.wav_ASR	and the glass shattered back
williamson14b_921.962_6.41.wav_ASR	and and the peanut was there
williamson14b_930.798_2.17.wav_ASR	and and a knife
williamson14b_934.477_2.21.wav_ASR	and he spread it around
williamson14b_938.003_3.4.wav_ASR	and make a peanut butter
williamson14b_943.261_0.32.wav_ASR	why
wright204a_21.326_0.39.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_33.919_2.51.wav_ASR	oh it it comes and goes
wright204a_36.502_8.6.wav_ASR	by that i mean normally i can get things but then there are times when i can't get the words out
wright204a_46.058_5.75.wav_ASR	so then i hafta either try and write them or speak the sentence
wright204a_52.361_3.35.wav_ASR	after the time i i i get it and sometimes i do
wright204a_70.687_0.41.wav_ASR	yes
wright204a_72.596_8.66.wav_ASR	well it was november nineteen eighty five six seven eight
wright204a_83.112_2.56.wav_ASR	it was right after obama's election
wright204a_87.358_3.86.wav_ASR	and i actually diagnosed it
wright204a_91.931_2.52.wav_ASR	designed that it was something was wrong with me
wright204a_94.5_1.48.wav_ASR	it was about five o'clock
wright204a_96.693_17.35.wav_ASR	and before i said anything to my wife i i went to computer to dump dump
wright204a_116.296_6.93.wav_ASR	it was a was firstnamed firstnameb
wright204a_125.236_1.64.wav_ASR	the doctor's thing you know
wright204a_127.587_1.32.wav_ASR	and i got stroke
wright204a_129.639_0.521.wav_ASR	and i
wright204a_131.354_1.07.wav_ASR	think i have a stroke
wright204a_132.539_1.42.wav_ASR	and then i went in and told my wife
wright204a_135.675_8.74.wav_ASR	and she was immediately because my motherinlaw had one notice that i had a little bit of swallow and
wright204a_144.878_3.05.wav_ASR	so she immediately called the paramedics
wright204a_148.982_0.93.wav_ASR	and i said
wright204a_150.235_2.4.wav_ASR	well they're doing that i gotta get dressed
wright204a_153.306_1.62.wav_ASR	and i had my shorts on
wright204a_154.992_4.06.wav_ASR	we hadta put a pair of hands on to go to the doctor right
wright204a_161.391_1.24.wav_ASR	and so i did
wright204a_163.103_1.76.wav_ASR	the americans came up
wright204a_165.426_1.7.wav_ASR	and i said
wright204a_168.011_1.22.wav_ASR	if i'm having a stroke
wright204a_169.941_1.47.wav_ASR	and they looked at me
wright204a_171.523_2.04.wav_ASR	and then they looked at me again
wright204a_173.581_0.4.wav_ASR	and they said
wright204a_174.146_0.86.wav_ASR	and i think you're right
wright204a_176.302_1.03.wav_ASR	so we went
wright204a_177.886_0.79.wav_ASR	everything was fine
wright204a_178.771_1.52.wav_ASR	and i was still awake
wright204a_180.306_1.01.wav_ASR	everything was great
wright204a_182.077_6.1.wav_ASR	and that's after going going on in the ambulance i sort of don't remember
wright204a_193.108_0.34.wav_ASR	well
wright204a_196.357_2.49.wav_ASR	well this is a stroke that's a bleeding stroke
wright204a_200.509_1.51.wav_ASR	that was the kind
wright204a_202.822_0.7.wav_ASR	yes right
wright204a_204.132_3.8.wav_ASR	which i understand is little bit less than half survive
wright204a_208.966_0.67.wav_ASR	and that was me
wright204a_210.501_0.9.wav_ASR	was one of the lucky ones
wright204a_212.664_5.3.wav_ASR	and i i was in three different hospitals
wright204a_218.922_5.15.wav_ASR	and really didn't come out of anything until about
wright204a_225.73_0.45.wav_ASR	well i'll see
wright204a_227.123_9.64.wav_ASR	and i would say the middle of december just before christmas eight is when i remember really for the first time
wright204a_238.834_1.62.wav_ASR	it was out for a long time
wright204a_240.614_4.38.wav_ASR	we had all kinds of tests and
wright204a_247.286_2.71.wav_ASR	two or three years ago
wright204a_250.143_1.63.wav_ASR	and she's all
wright204a_252.388_1.03.wav_ASR	that's what they're called
wright204a_255.308_1.49.wav_ASR	peanu that puts it
wright204a_258.047_5.38.wav_ASR	and from then on then i was at firstnamer
wright204a_263.563_11.04.wav_ASR	and i remember all of the girls where i had all three of them things for speech therapy
wright204a_285.874_1.82.wav_ASR	well i'm a lot slower than them
wright204a_288.289_6.62.wav_ASR	and i i hadta learn to use more of my left hand than i wanted to
wright204a_295.072_5.09.wav_ASR	but i was paralyzed on the whole right side
wright204a_301.173_1.18.wav_ASR	for quite a long time
wright204a_303.069_4.89.wav_ASR	when i got out of the hospital for the third time i was in a wheelchair
wright204a_315.318_2.19.wav_ASR	and no they were all all from one to the other
wright204a_318.564_0.31.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_319.489_15.42.wav_ASR	so i really from a december of ol eight through about the end of december december january of nine i was in the hospital
wright204a_337.032_3.05.wav_ASR	so because we had different problems
wright204a_340.132_1.81.wav_ASR	and i had firstnamed
wright204a_343.379_4.39.wav_ASR	and some other kind of things that i i don't even remember
wright204a_348.779_3.78.wav_ASR	and so it it took a long time just to get out of the hospital
wright204a_353.142_6.05.wav_ASR	but i was home in december to just december january
wright204a_360.553_13.81.wav_ASR	several in february the first no third i started out therapy at children children's hospital over in jan
wright204a_375.474_6.3.wav_ASR	and i've been there through the end of the year
wright204a_391.134_0.65.wav_ASR	that's correct
wright204a_400.899_0.38.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_423.934_1.43.wav_ASR	just oh jeez
wright204a_426.385_3.17.wav_ASR	and i had a very good life
wright204a_430.939_2.71.wav_ASR	and i don't know
wright204a_434.419_0.39.wav_ASR	married
wright204a_435.869_1.32.wav_ASR	that was the pick up
wright204a_437.931_2.89.wav_ASR	my first child was a big event
wright204a_441.696_4.35.wav_ASR	my second third and fourth children were
wright204a_448.445_4.81.wav_ASR	we just had her fifty anniversary this first
wright204a_454.55_4.98.wav_ASR	well it'll be a year and in march april april
wright204a_460.255_1.8.wav_ASR	we're fifty first here
wright204a_462.698_3.202.wav_ASR	oh there's lots of things you know
wright204a_466.905_2.09.wav_ASR	and i had a good life as a child
wright204a_469.055_1.22.wav_ASR	it was an only child
wright204a_471.226_6.03.wav_ASR	well i don't really know what to say
wright204a_488.482_2.61.wav_ASR	well it's gonna get a little quieter with the two of them
wright204a_551.677_4.2.wav_ASR	the little boy is playing with a soccer ball i guess
wright204a_556.512_3.27.wav_ASR	and he happens to hit the window
wright204a_562.435_1.63.wav_ASR	and it goes in
wright204a_564.087_8.98.wav_ASR	and the guy inside is is in the picture is sitting down
wright204a_573.142_3.66.wav_ASR	and it hits them i guess or at least it comes in the window
wright204a_577.402_1.19.wav_ASR	so we've got glass
wright204a_579.694_1.82.wav_ASR	and he goes
wright204a_581.882_2.06.wav_ASR	and he looks at the window
wright204a_583.994_0.79.wav_ASR	and he has the ball
wright204a_584.804_8.2.wav_ASR	and apparently he's going out to see what happened and maybe let the ball go back to the little child
wright204a_611.342_0.53.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_612.361_1.49.wav_ASR	looks like it's ready for school
wright204a_614.634_3.67.wav_ASR	he says looks like he might wanna take the umbrella
wright204a_619.559_2.09.wav_ASR	he's probably just said okay
wright204a_623.716_0.88.wav_ASR	and did she say
wright204a_625.692_0.59.wav_ASR	maybe not
wright204a_626.402_0.35.wav_ASR	don't know
wright204a_626.8_2.35.wav_ASR	because now he's going to school
wright204a_629.803_0.94.wav_ASR	oh it isn't
wright204a_630.763_0.47.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_633.482_1.14.wav_ASR	he says
wright204a_634.899_1.17.wav_ASR	oh i don't think i need it
wright204a_637.004_1.53.wav_ASR	the girl
wright204a_639.482_1.63.wav_ASR	and he must be waiting for the bus
wright204a_641.129_1.2.wav_ASR	and it's driving the rain
wright204a_642.924_2.12.wav_ASR	so now it's coming down pretty good
wright204a_645.498_1.72.wav_ASR	so he goes back to the house
wright204a_647.796_0.36.wav_ASR	and he says
wright204a_648.654_0.66.wav_ASR	well i'm all wet
wright204a_650.019_0.33.wav_ASR	and he says
wright204a_651.289_1.3.wav_ASR	maybe i'd better go take the umbrella
wright204a_672.485_0.54.wav_ASR	let's see
wright204a_677.959_4.91.wav_ASR	looks like the problem is the cat is stuck up in a tree
wright204a_683.65_0.4.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_685.27_2.21.wav_ASR	father is out on the
wright204a_687.552_3.18.wav_ASR	and he's kinda stuck himself i think
wright204a_691.424_2.46.wav_ASR	the little girl is crying for the cat
wright204a_694.509_1.57.wav_ASR	oh she got a umbrella
wright204a_696.668_4.34.wav_ASR	there's a guy up in the dog barking up the tree
wright204a_701.845_1.46.wav_ASR	the fire department is coming
wright204a_703.403_5.75.wav_ASR	the little girl was trying to reach him i guess
wright204a_709.619_2.69.wav_ASR	and i don't know she was trying to get this ladder or not
wright204a_712.623_1.35.wav_ASR	and i have no idea about that
wright204a_715.021_2.4.wav_ASR	but anyway i don't know
wright204a_717.541_1.03.wav_ASR	fire truck is there
wright204a_718.865_6.08.wav_ASR	and they're coming out with a ladder apparently to help get the cat and father out of the tree
wright204a_729.715_0.44.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_730.298_1.47.wav_ASR	well that's a real picture
wright204a_733.872_5.81.wav_ASR	well this is a probably a flooded storm
wright204a_740.511_1.38.wav_ASR	probably right here in arizona
wright204a_744.599_3.77.wav_ASR	the girl was apparently waved down the river
wright204a_749.301_2.17.wav_ASR	and this is her rescue
wright204a_752.238_8.31.wav_ASR	and she is heading onto a branch that they're trying to get him to a safe
wright204a_764.718_0.38.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_772.353_0.32.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_776.476_0.63.wav_ASR	yes i do
wright204a_903.564_5.15.wav_ASR	well she was
wright204a_911.851_7.38.wav_ASR	the the story involves around the two daughters and the what i'd call the the couple
wright204a_920.645_13.21.wav_ASR	and i i i couldn't remember even from looking at that what the relationship was to the the good girl cinderella
wright204a_935.994_4.63.wav_ASR	now i know that she was like a servant
wright204a_941.361_9.2.wav_ASR	and had all to to was they were really putting her down
wright204a_950.842_7.62.wav_ASR	well she was always doing stuff where the other two girls were you know very nice
wright204a_958.521_3.91.wav_ASR	and was all nice and stuff for for them
wright204a_962.813_18.18.wav_ASR	when they went to the the ball it turned out that the cinderella was the one who they put the shoe on
wright204a_982.77_14.44.wav_ASR	and then when they got away because the a pumpkin that was gonna turn into a pumpkin she hadta get back
wright204a_997.767_7.21.wav_ASR	and she lost a shoe
wright204a_1006.404_0.31.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_1007.312_9.14.wav_ASR	and so then when the people i guess one of the people with the the
wright204a_1018.414_1.11.wav_ASR	well what happened
wright204a_1019.765_5.209.wav_ASR	it's the cinderella
wright204a_1026.704_2.301.wav_ASR	see this is my trouble with the story
wright204a_1029.076_5.01.wav_ASR	we're trying to get the
wright204a_1037.097_1.48.wav_ASR	it's the prince
wright204a_1039.786_3.76.wav_ASR	and he he was trying to find
wright204a_1044.411_1.69.wav_ASR	and he was out looking
wright204a_1047.777_0.92.wav_ASR	he had the shoe
wright204a_1049.77_4.47.wav_ASR	and it this shoe the only one that really fit was cinderella
wright204a_1055.312_1.88.wav_ASR	and so he didn't say
wright204a_1057.679_2.63.wav_ASR	and they'll be man and wife
wright204a_1060.912_1.76.wav_ASR	you know everything will be fine forever
wright204a_1067.508_0.34.wav_ASR	okay
