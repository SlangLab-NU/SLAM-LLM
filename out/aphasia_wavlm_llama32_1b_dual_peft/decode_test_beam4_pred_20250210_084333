kansas04a_29.341_0.86.wav_ASR	please tell me about it
kansas04a_30.225_7.48.wav_ASR	it's a february twenty eight in nineteen eighteen
kansas04a_42.61_11.38.wav_ASR	well my stroke started on one night and i did not think it was too bad
kansas04a_54.764_1.58.wav_ASR	so started to notice that something was wrong
kansas04a_56.809_9.79.wav_ASR	and then i went out with my friends and they were concerned because i was driving accidentally
kansas04a_68.079_9.21.wav_ASR	and she said that i drove too close to cars and i had difficulty with my speech
kansas04a_77.957_5.16.wav_ASR	and i went home and i met my husband at the local watering hole
kansas04a_84.83_3.35.wav_ASR	and hadta drink and i went home
kansas04a_88.529_5.344.wav_ASR	that was not my usual way of doing
kansas04a_95.153_1.87.wav_ASR	don't talking to anybody or anything
kansas04a_97.072_3.29.wav_ASR	and so i went home and i went to bed at night
kansas04a_100.589_2.91.wav_ASR	and i got up next morning and went to work
kansas04a_104.276_4.63.wav_ASR	and i went to a a change meeting
kansas04a_109.508_10.63.wav_ASR	and when i came back out i noticed that i caught very badly
kansas04a_121.372_4.48.wav_ASR	and i went to work and then one of the girls came in and said
kansas04a_126.873_2.64.wav_ASR	you're not using your arm correctly
kansas04a_131.007_0.4.wav_ASR	and he says
kansas04a_131.688_1.2.wav_ASR	they think i'm having a stroke
kansas04a_133.315_0.93.wav_ASR	call the doctor
kansas04a_134.744_8.79.wav_ASR	and she told me to go to the emergency room and not to drive
kansas04a_144.096_13.82.wav_ASR	and at that point i was confused enough that i was thinking about the ambulance across the street from my office
kansas04a_158.827_1.8.wav_ASR	so i'd drive myself
kansas04a_161.92_1.11.wav_ASR	so i drove myself
kansas04a_163.284_3.31.wav_ASR	and i got out there parked in the proper place
kansas04a_167.312_3.2.wav_ASR	and then i met my husband there
kansas04a_170.986_6.08.wav_ASR	and i told him to tell them what what i thought
kansas04a_177.562_3.58.wav_ASR	because i could not communicate at that point
kansas04a_182.356_4.06.wav_ASR	and i was there for over night and they sent me home
kansas04a_187.406_9.41.wav_ASR	and then i did not feel well next to the hospital so he i had him take me back to the hospital and i stayed for couple weeks
kansas04a_207.011_5.1.wav_ASR	well i had therapy in all my speech and writing
kansas04a_213.604_6.17.wav_ASR	but they didn't give it to me for very long
kansas04a_220.931_5.04.wav_ASR	and when i was in the hospital i had my speech and right therapy
kansas04a_226.382_3.15.wav_ASR	and then i got home and had some physical therapy
kansas04a_259.052_0.729.wav_ASR	and you're all done
kansas04a_263.423_8.6.wav_ASR	well when i got married the first time i hadta plan my whole wedding myself because mom was much older
kansas04a_273.102_2.34.wav_ASR	and she left it up to me
kansas04a_276.529_5.33.wav_ASR	and i went home and then went back to laundry
kansas04a_281.881_3.75.wav_ASR	yeah i got married in danford in danford chris
kansas04a_294.955_9.48.wav_ASR	and we had dinner and then we went to back to the hotel
kansas04a_304.94_3.42.wav_ASR	and my uncle married me
kansas04a_309.335_2.86.wav_ASR	and he's a mesenteritis medicine man
kansas04a_313.018_7.98.wav_ASR	and his wife took over the bathroom tidied up my sister and i in there
kansas04a_322.108_15.2.wav_ASR	so then we went to the chapel and on the way my brother inlaw was driving and he almost rushed us
kansas04a_342.23_1.91.wav_ASR	yeah i think that will be enough at that story
kansas04a_369.621_4.36.wav_ASR	well this little boy is practicing his soccer ball
kansas04a_376.048_2.66.wav_ASR	and then he kicks it through the window
kansas04a_379.812_1.49.wav_ASR	and it breaks the window
kansas04a_382.375_3.03.wav_ASR	and it goes into this man's house
kansas04a_386.256_1.9.wav_ASR	and he's very startled
kansas04a_389.349_6.47.wav_ASR	and he gets up and looks out the window to see where it came from
kansas04a_396.096_10.7.wav_ASR	now it does not tell you whether the boy ran away or whether he kicked the soccer ball
kansas04a_435.24_4.79.wav_ASR	mother wants the little boy to take the umbrella
kansas04a_443.068_1.73.wav_ASR	he doesn't want to take the umbrella
kansas04a_446.585_4.68.wav_ASR	so he goes out and it starts to rain of course as his mother told him what
kansas04a_452.243_1.56.wav_ASR	so he goes back
kansas04a_454.24_0.91.wav_ASR	and she tells him
kansas04a_455.171_1.15.wav_ASR	and he's very wet
kansas04a_457.426_5.56.wav_ASR	so we goes back in the house and she's very anxious with him because he hasn't taken the umbrella
kansas04a_463.777_7.44.wav_ASR	so in the last picture he has the umbrella and he's walking very happily
kansas04a_506.81_1.84.wav_ASR	well the cat is in the tree
kansas04a_510.155_1.81.wav_ASR	dog is barking it's cat
kansas04a_513.126_4.38.wav_ASR	and the little girl is crying because her cat is in the tree
kansas04a_519.099_8.07.wav_ASR	and her father tried to get it with a ladder and the ladder has fallen down
kansas04a_527.276_4.41.wav_ASR	and the father is still in the tree he's looking very gloomy
kansas04a_532.649_2.56.wav_ASR	and the birds are singing
kansas04a_537.485_4.46.wav_ASR	that's really quiet as everything else is going on
kansas04a_542.482_5.22.wav_ASR	and the fireman had been called and they were going to hafta get cat down
kansas04a_547.988_3.8.wav_ASR	but i think before they do they'll hafta get daddy down
kansas04a_576.487_1.57.wav_ASR	there's been a flood
kansas04a_582.466_4.23.wav_ASR	and this lady has been swept away in the flood
kansas04a_590.504_12.69.wav_ASR	and this gentleman in the jacket is coming to rescue her
kansas04a_604.912_6.77.wav_ASR	he's been swept away in the flood also looks to me
kansas04a_613.723_13.02.wav_ASR	and i do not quite understand this part
kansas04a_634.622_1.22.wav_ASR	yeah i think i am
kansas04a_636.851_1.21.wav_ASR	you know what is that
kansas04a_643.48_6.31.wav_ASR	but which one is being rejected in which one isn't
kansas04a_661.844_0.6.wav_ASR	oh yes
kansas04a_668.087_0.84.wav_ASR	not terrible
kansas04a_688.588_0.82.wav_ASR	okay
kansas04a_756.402_5.91.wav_ASR	the story is about cinderella and the wicked stepmother and her two half sisters
kansas04a_762.492_0.68.wav_ASR	and yeah
kansas04a_763.997_11.67.wav_ASR	her stepsisters were very unhappy to her and her stepmother was too
kansas04a_776.051_5.38.wav_ASR	seattle was left to sweep and clean and do whatever they wanted done
kansas04a_782.592_7.02.wav_ASR	so they got a letter inviting the houseold to the the ball
kansas04a_791.424_5.37.wav_ASR	the mother said that cinderella could not go
kansas04a_798.1_1.62.wav_ASR	and she was very upset
kansas04a_800.608_12.89.wav_ASR	and so she tried to get her dress together and the two stepsisters tore apart
kansas04a_815.132_22.74.wav_ASR	and so she went out and told her fairy godmother that they hadta get it apart she wasn't going to get to go
kansas04a_837.925_6.54.wav_ASR	and and the fairy godmother said she could
kansas04a_845.377_4.79.wav_ASR	they met her dress and with her wand of course
kansas04a_850.747_14.83.wav_ASR	so the stepstepmother and stepchildren started out and she did not go with them
kansas04a_865.963_15.24.wav_ASR	but she went in the carriage that the fairy godmother had contacted out of a pumpkin and mice and horse
kansas04a_881.57_0.95.wav_ASR	and horse shows and something
kansas04a_883.45_2.91.wav_ASR	and she went to the ball
kansas04a_887.004_4.42.wav_ASR	and the prince reached her at the ball
kansas04a_892.03_1.55.wav_ASR	and they danced
kansas04a_893.647_1.85.wav_ASR	and then it was a twelve o'clock
kansas04a_895.645_2.1.wav_ASR	and she hadta be home by twelve o'clock
kansas04a_897.799_2.56.wav_ASR	so she ran out and lost her slipper
kansas04a_901.571_7.85.wav_ASR	and she went and got the carriage and of course the carriage all collapsed
kansas04a_909.825_1.47.wav_ASR	and she went home
kansas04a_912.607_9.82.wav_ASR	and then the falling weak or so the time left
kansas04a_922.783_10.71.wav_ASR	the footman set out with a the slipper to find which girl in the kingdom he fit
kansas04a_934.46_7.29.wav_ASR	and she was locked in her room so she could not get down
kansas04a_942.65_2.64.wav_ASR	and she was very upset
kansas04a_946.239_4.44.wav_ASR	and it's easy
kansas04a_952.096_3.38.wav_ASR	and anyway the the mister lewis out
kansas04a_957.72_3.9.wav_ASR	and she came down and and of course she fit the slipper
kansas04a_962.075_1.87.wav_ASR	but the other did not fit
kansas04a_972.186_1.4.wav_ASR	yes yes
kansas04a_981.336_5.42.wav_ASR	we would get two pieces of bread the peanut butter and the jelly
kansas04a_988.038_1.31.wav_ASR	then i would get a knife
kansas04a_990.452_4.73.wav_ASR	and get some of the peanut butter spread it on one piece of bread
kansas04a_995.9_4.73.wav_ASR	and spread the jelly on the same piece of bread
kansas04a_1001.062_1.38.wav_ASR	and then put the drop on it
kansas04a_1005.16_3.55.wav_ASR	oh yes i've had breakfast there

kansas05a_364.761_2.21.wav_ASR	and i didn't meet that but yeah
kansas05a_374.375_2.99.wav_ASR	because i wanted to have us to do better
kansas05a_379.021_4.21.wav_ASR	it it's much more difficult
kansas05a_384.531_4.34.wav_ASR	you know when i look around and i see a lot of people who don't
kansas05a_389.118_1.34.wav_ASR	you know they go through here
kansas05a_390.473_0.99.wav_ASR	you don't talk to people
kansas05a_391.485_2.95.wav_ASR	and maybe i had different right problems
kansas05a_394.676_3.96.wav_ASR	you know i have no problems with my eating my legs you know and all that
kansas05a_398.681_2.2.wav_ASR	but i don't have any problems particularly
kansas05a_401.308_2.97.wav_ASR	he useta time as time gone on i hadta get better
kansas05a_405.255_6.03.wav_ASR	but now where was i going
kansas05a_411.561_1.63.wav_ASR	what were you asking me again
kansas05a_420.085_1.64.wav_ASR	oh yes why was i talking about here
kansas05a_422.593_9.96.wav_ASR	we're i'm working along with working towards having more time more more
kansas05a_434.918_3.07.wav_ASR	as time goes on i learn more and more what to do
kansas05a_439.556_1.65.wav_ASR	and so that's what i'm doing
kansas05a_467.065_0.97.wav_ASR	so they come different
kansas05a_468.95_4.67.wav_ASR	how tell me the story with a beginning a middle and an end
kansas05a_473.861_0.95.wav_ASR	so each one
kansas05a_480.821_2.29.wav_ASR	so each one of these i'm supposta do something with it
kansas05a_483.43_0.79.wav_ASR	that what you're saying
kansas05a_497.343_0.77.wav_ASR	and yeah yeah
kansas05a_504.475_17.939.wav_ASR	well the first one is learning through this this this mess
kansas05a_529.355_7.84.wav_ASR	it's a a plant a plant a proper
kansas05a_540.213_11.2.wav_ASR	that with a a a a plant or a a cinderella
kansas05a_554.453_7.16.wav_ASR	there's a friend eat eating with this this one
kansas05a_563.678_3.27.wav_ASR	because these these people are making a problem
kansas05a_580.09_0.63.wav_ASR	what is that
kansas05a_589.826_1.82.wav_ASR	oh that's kinda dumb stuff
kansas05a_593.266_2.41.wav_ASR	how i think that takes a little work to make that look right
kansas05a_596.395_2.36.wav_ASR	okay i'm supposta
kansas05a_600.809_1.48.wav_ASR	what am i supposta do with this one
kansas05a_603.491_0.94.wav_ASR	what's it afraid of
kansas05a_605.0_1.13.wav_ASR	did the window break
kansas05a_608.523_1.45.wav_ASR	okay well that's it then
kansas05a_643.723_19.47.wav_ASR	so the the first person is a dressed a professional there
kansas05a_666.113_5.28.wav_ASR	and then he went to the ball
kansas05a_674.141_4.53.wav_ASR	looking at the tear tendons again
kansas05a_681.195_14.69.wav_ASR	and being that second people should
kansas05a_702.031_0.71.wav_ASR	it think so
kansas05a_703.736_3.14.wav_ASR	he he's not sposta do that for him
kansas05a_708.008_3.8.wav_ASR	but this one guy wants the these pinched to come down
kansas05a_712.325_1.15.wav_ASR	where he wants to by himself
kansas05a_715.293_1.03.wav_ASR	so it's not quite right yet
kansas05a_718.205_0.34.wav_ASR	what
kansas05a_719.0_0.38.wav_ASR	which one

kurland04b_274.187_0.59.wav_ASR	okay
kurland04b_275.784_3.38.wav_ASR	there was a boy playing soccer
kurland04b_279.21_1.19.wav_ASR	and he kicked the ball
kurland04b_280.601_3.34.wav_ASR	and the ball went through the window
kurland04b_285.546_0.94.wav_ASR	and he was outside
kurland04b_286.501_2.07.wav_ASR	and he kicked the ball inside
kurland04b_289.17_4.27.wav_ASR	and it it knocked over a lamp
kurland04b_294.053_5.06.wav_ASR	and his father was angry

kurland04b_325.478_5.62.wav_ASR	the boy was walking or was leaving his house
kurland04b_332.737_2.95.wav_ASR	and his mother wanted him to take the umbrella
kurland04b_335.708_1.08.wav_ASR	and he said no
kurland04b_337.284_1.26.wav_ASR	so he left
kurland04b_339.461_2.31.wav_ASR	his mother wasn't too pleased
kurland04b_342.508_3.26.wav_ASR	and while he was walking to school it started to rain
kurland04b_346.492_1.52.wav_ASR	so he ran back home
kurland04b_348.069_5.04.wav_ASR	and his mother saw that he was wet
kurland04b_353.882_7.11.wav_ASR	and he got the umbrella and walked back to school with the umbrella
kurland04b_374.405_13.31.wav_ASR	the man was trying to get the cat out of the tree
kurland04b_388.147_1.2.wav_ASR	he had a ladder
kurland04b_389.936_2.71.wav_ASR	and he climbed up onto the branch
kurland04b_392.665_2.29.wav_ASR	and the ladder fell over
kurland04b_395.678_2.92.wav_ASR	and someone called the fire department
kurland04b_399.132_5.21.wav_ASR	and the fire department came and got him outta the tree
kurland04b_411.534_0.48.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
kurland04b_418.783_0.42.wav_ASR	okay
kurland04b_501.28_0.938.wav_ASR	okay
kurland04b_502.933_10.18.wav_ASR	seattle's father married a woman who had two children
kurland04b_514.207_23.16.wav_ASR	and so the her cinderella's two stepsisters and her stepmother made cinderella clean up after everything
kurland04b_537.717_2.96.wav_ASR	and she hadta wash the floor
kurland04b_576.021_10.95.wav_ASR	and so the two stepsisters weren't gonna allow cinderella to come
kurland04b_588.209_21.45.wav_ASR	so after they left for the ball cinderella's fairy godmother came and washed her into a pretty ball gown gown
kurland04b_610.285_3.9.wav_ASR	and the pumpkin changed changed into a carriage
kurland04b_614.697_6.21.wav_ASR	and the rats or mice turned into the horses
kurland04b_621.488_7.74.wav_ASR	and her fairy godmother told her she hadta be back home by midnight
kurland04b_629.955_4.56.wav_ASR	and so she went in the the carriage
kurland04b_636.078_5.33.wav_ASR	and at the ball she met the prince
kurland04b_641.783_1.09.wav_ASR	and they danced
kurland04b_643.405_4.44.wav_ASR	and then the clock struck struck twelve
kurland04b_648.219_3.82.wav_ASR	and cinderella ran away
kurland04b_652.338_6.83.wav_ASR	and as she ran away her one of her glass slippers fell
kurland04b_659.969_1.51.wav_ASR	and the prince picked it up
kurland04b_663.127_2.45.wav_ASR	and so then he he says
kurland04b_665.948_6.29.wav_ASR	it was the only way that he could find her was through the the glass slipper
kurland04b_672.358_3.3.wav_ASR	so he went to everyone's house
kurland04b_676.494_9.98.wav_ASR	and at cinderella's house her stepmother had locked her in a room
kurland04b_686.985_3.17.wav_ASR	and the mice came and gave her the key
kurland04b_691.051_8.14.wav_ASR	and then the prince tried the slipper on the two stepsisters
kurland04b_699.268_6.01.wav_ASR	and their feet were too big for the the glass slipper
kurland04b_705.772_6.16.wav_ASR	and then cinderella came outta the the closet of the room
kurland04b_711.953_4.78.wav_ASR	and the glass glass slipper fit her
kurland04b_717.438_7.39.wav_ASR	and the prince and cinderella lived happily ever
kurland04b_737.783_0.71.wav_ASR	okay
kurland04b_739.13_3.31.wav_ASR	and i would get two pieces of bread
kurland04b_743.279_3.94.wav_ASR	and i would get out the peanut butter in the jelly
kurland04b_747.695_7.73.wav_ASR	and then i would spread one slice with peanut butter and the other slice with jelly
kurland04b_756.291_5.4.wav_ASR	then i would put the two pieces together
kurland04b_762.256_2.42.wav_ASR	and hit it
kurland04b_764.991_0.62.wav_ASR	and eat it
kurland04b_770.477_0.39.wav_ASR	yeah
kurland04b_771.798_0.74.wav_ASR	here we are
kurland05a_152.51_11.42.wav_ASR	well if i had seen i was a ten before the stroke i'd say probably maybe five or six you know popped up

kurland05a_346.798_14.85.wav_ASR	and you know so the whole day you know i found out that if you do the the doctors with in three hours your stroke they have a chance to change the course of it or you recover whatever it is
kurland05a_362.512_4.01.wav_ASR	and it was the horses were out of the barn but time to say
kurland05a_367.407_2.24.wav_ASR	and i took the m r
kurland05a_369.736_4.53.wav_ASR	and here you know i wanted to suppress therapy and you know
kurland05a_375.33_1.04.wav_ASR	there's two types of things
kurland05a_376.429_0.74.wav_ASR	and she says
kurland05a_377.191_1.66.wav_ASR	but those lasted a few more times
kurland05a_378.867_3.56.wav_ASR	but the speech therapy you hafta three four months
kurland05a_383.2_3.25.wav_ASR	and finally my therapy says you know
kurland05a_386.799_2.27.wav_ASR	thank you reached the your path to
kurland05a_389.246_3.71.wav_ASR	you know i was relieved
kurland05a_393.01_3.82.wav_ASR	and it proved you know she was right
kurland05a_396.85_2.72.wav_ASR	and i i planted you know after six months
kurland05a_399.661_4.34.wav_ASR	and now as six and a half years later i'm still flatoted
kurland05a_421.506_4.57.wav_ASR	one thing was was quite clear i was very tired
kurland05a_426.134_3.9.wav_ASR	so i useta get six hours sleep at night when i was working
kurland05a_430.627_6.75.wav_ASR	you probably went to nine hours you know with an a nap in the afternoon for a half an hour
kurland05a_439.185_11.7.wav_ASR	my therapy you know i told my therapist you know that's why i told you to the stroke
kurland05a_450.9_1.92.wav_ASR	but she tried to help me with that
kurland05a_453.377_9.07.wav_ASR	and the only way i could you use the cool cards you you use the key cards you hafta say
kurland05a_463.012_4.16.wav_ASR	where i could have had a patient in the like a cane speech
kurland05a_467.738_5.68.wav_ASR	but i it was not able to really talk you know right now
kurland05a_475.53_10.57.wav_ASR	just the best way i could describe things if if i was a thirty five arachnoid regular egg i was trying to talk to seventy eight arachnoid rat
kurland05a_486.35_2.39.wav_ASR	and i could get in the safe life back home
kurland05a_489.477_14.42.wav_ASR	and it's not quite quite as bad you know individual but when i talk to a bunch of people in a noisy room it's you just wanna see
kurland05a_504.51_7.96.wav_ASR	very much downstairs there's there's two people in the you know occupational health kind of
kurland05a_515.462_0.671.wav_ASR	and you could get bigger
kurland05a_554.732_7.46.wav_ASR	well i have had many things happen but i hafta one that often my stroke
kurland05a_564.856_3.3.wav_ASR	my stroke took place several four
kurland05a_568.92_6.03.wav_ASR	and my physical year ended on october first you know for my seeing stuff
kurland05a_575.71_0.86.wav_ASR	and they says
kurland05a_576.684_1.21.wav_ASR	who they june jeez
kurland05a_578.401_1.34.wav_ASR	hey five months to go
kurland05a_579.76_4.27.wav_ASR	so i had on all my caregivers
kurland05a_584.704_4.17.wav_ASR	so i i wanted to call nine one one
kurland05a_589.765_1.96.wav_ASR	and and it was stroke
kurland05a_592.346_2.85.wav_ASR	and i my wife didn't wanna go
kurland05a_595.53_1.56.wav_ASR	but i took me all the fun
kurland05a_601.36_2.91.wav_ASR	they're they're two thousand
kurland05a_604.371_11.19.wav_ASR	when i got up to except the area i i started crying
kurland05a_622.298_0.93.wav_ASR	and that's all they
kurland05a_624.482_0.93.wav_ASR	they never used to cry
kurland05a_630.564_8.41.wav_ASR	but you know it's just something that they they said a additivir a a lot of the stroke
kurland05a_639.446_6.27.wav_ASR	and that's you couldn't stay with me
kurland05a_649.2_2.38.wav_ASR	and it starts to rain
kurland05a_653.67_4.13.wav_ASR	he hit here a massive face at a field
kurland05a_662.527_0.85.wav_ASR	don't ask me why
kurland05a_666.225_1.64.wav_ASR	and it's very weird
kurland05a_668.408_6.34.wav_ASR	because you know i'd be with crack in your nose something or the you know the pain of radiation
kurland05a_674.801_6.03.wav_ASR	but you know it's very very obvious
kurland05a_685.515_3.9.wav_ASR	well this is too tough for me
kurland05a_690.856_2.46.wav_ASR	and you know watching tv shows you know
kurland05a_695.249_3.53.wav_ASR	it might be some stupid like the bathroom you know
kurland05a_700.718_10.62.wav_ASR	if i come in my wife's house and you know they'll live cinderella see and you know they'll look over her and she's sitting there and i'm crying
kurland05a_712.137_5.12.wav_ASR	and i don't like to shift away but you know i can get over
kurland05a_717.971_2.22.wav_ASR	it's it's it's very dry
kurland05a_722.507_2.3.wav_ASR	well a bunch of my family friends
kurland05a_725.084_2.06.wav_ASR	so the new shoe and a cute pair
kurland05a_727.159_0.59.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
kurland05a_736.401_0.79.wav_ASR	and i know
kurland05a_767.64_0.42.wav_ASR	okay
kurland05a_768.713_6.43.wav_ASR	well this comes on the road because i played soccer football with me in your mind
kurland05a_775.731_4.04.wav_ASR	and the first picture shows a young guy playing soccer
kurland05a_780.772_0.81.wav_ASR	he kicked the ball
kurland05a_781.6_6.34.wav_ASR	and he must have to close the house because he he put the bar right through the window
kurland05a_789.212_6.9.wav_ASR	and as luck would have been right by the window where the home owner was sitting right behind the window
kurland05a_796.131_4.91.wav_ASR	and he knocked the ladder over so me hit the lamp over and smashed it
kurland05a_801.46_2.26.wav_ASR	so you did clinical dermatology again
kurland05a_804.612_7.97.wav_ASR	and the last picture shows the home owner you hold in the soccer ball and look out the guy
kurland05a_812.6_5.26.wav_ASR	so i didn't manage what happened on the pituitorhea if there was one
kurland05a_855.661_3.73.wav_ASR	well i guess it shows a woman and a probably her son
kurland05a_860.063_1.44.wav_ASR	and he wants to go outside again
kurland05a_862.307_0.51.wav_ASR	but she says
kurland05a_862.998_2.06.wav_ASR	take your umbrella you know where you go
kurland05a_865.108_1.27.wav_ASR	and he'd wanna take it
kurland05a_867.751_2.56.wav_ASR	and she offered to them twice like this
kurland05a_870.393_1.62.wav_ASR	and he still didn't take it
kurland05a_872.035_0.74.wav_ASR	and he was all sad
kurland05a_872.828_3.42.wav_ASR	and the third picture shows again
kurland05a_876.326_4.09.wav_ASR	and before picture two shows me the different words you know
kurland05a_882.162_1.98.wav_ASR	so he comes back inside soaking wet
kurland05a_884.93_0.85.wav_ASR	and mother said
kurland05a_885.939_0.89.wav_ASR	where i told you so
kurland05a_886.879_5.12.wav_ASR	and the last picture shows him with an umbrella like she shoulda had the first place
kurland05a_903.958_0.5.wav_ASR	alright
kurland05a_916.499_3.08.wav_ASR	well eventually the cat climbed the tree
kurland05a_919.6_3.77.wav_ASR	and as catchats were prone to do down the tree
kurland05a_925.566_9.21.wav_ASR	and a homeowner or somebody you'd mail the cat down the tree and he could get the cat down there
kurland05a_936.567_1.42.wav_ASR	the girl's crying for her cat
kurland05a_939.74_3.82.wav_ASR	oh the real thing getting get down because the ladder fell down
kurland05a_944.348_0.99.wav_ASR	so he stuck in the tree
kurland05a_945.353_5.63.wav_ASR	and the dog you know barked at the cat and the guy tried
kurland05a_951.07_3.66.wav_ASR	so because we know why the cat is up in the tree
kurland05a_955.677_6.53.wav_ASR	and then as we did the right show the fire department came to get the cat down from the tree and the guy
kurland05a_965.049_1.31.wav_ASR	and he's this one
kurland05a_992.053_3.05.wav_ASR	oh my son watched cinderella right before
kurland05a_997.143_0.83.wav_ASR	he he was saying
kurland05a_998.255_3.97.wav_ASR	you watched all the days movies you know over and over again
kurland05a_1003.251_2.88.wav_ASR	and me overall not worth your time i mean
kurland05a_1008.346_1.36.wav_ASR	four fifty five times yeah
kurland05a_1011.908_1.15.wav_ASR	and most of me
kurland05a_1016.878_9.9.wav_ASR	well i watched so many movies for him cinderella might even small small story too
kurland05a_1041.624_0.32.wav_ASR	okay
kurland05a_1045.64_1.219.wav_ASR	and i'll take one
kurland05a_1049.637_0.39.wav_ASR	okay
kurland05a_1129.285_5.26.wav_ASR	how i'm gonna give you my version is gonna be very short
kurland05a_1136.092_2.46.wav_ASR	it starts off with a young girl
kurland05a_1138.93_1.73.wav_ASR	and thank she has two sisters maybe
kurland05a_1140.678_8.22.wav_ASR	and she's a least favorite of the the knock out of three even though she's the you know the knock out of three
kurland05a_1150.4_1.95.wav_ASR	her mother is even worse
kurland05a_1152.368_6.1.wav_ASR	and she you know i i care of the evil godmother always
kurland05a_1159.027_3.22.wav_ASR	and he always
kurland05a_1163.206_2.53.wav_ASR	and she wanted to go the ball
kurland05a_1165.752_0.99.wav_ASR	oh she couldn't even talk
kurland05a_1166.764_5.58.wav_ASR	so that's some how she she got to go to the ball
kurland05a_1172.459_3.71.wav_ASR	and they always at the ball there's a prince there
kurland05a_1177.292_2.11.wav_ASR	and i think he had a slipper on
kurland05a_1179.426_3.52.wav_ASR	and he tried to slip around the everywhere every girl there
kurland05a_1183.783_5.14.wav_ASR	and as luck would have cinderella you know fit in the shoe
kurland05a_1190.594_3.78.wav_ASR	and anyway i hope they're fine
kurland05a_1194.524_3.16.wav_ASR	so you know they're happy ever
kurland05a_1201.033_0.43.wav_ASR	they had
kurland05a_1220.688_0.84.wav_ASR	and that's really easy
kurland05a_1222.699_3.27.wav_ASR	and i would take the bread out of the box
kurland05a_1227.109_5.61.wav_ASR	and i use only almond whole wheat because that's healthier for my son
kurland05a_1234.237_4.55.wav_ASR	because i'd been making lunches for six months now
kurland05a_1239.613_1.78.wav_ASR	and there tuesday has a peanut butter and jelly sandwich
kurland05a_1241.442_5.12.wav_ASR	and i always had a hole of two pieces of bread
kurland05a_1247.075_1.39.wav_ASR	they met on the table
kurland05a_1249.538_2.64.wav_ASR	and one i put the grape jelly
kurland05a_1252.921_0.81.wav_ASR	he lost his rain
kurland05a_1254.656_4.23.wav_ASR	and then i put skippy smooth spread on the other side
kurland05a_1259.156_3.63.wav_ASR	and i put the piece of bread together
kurland05a_1262.831_7.23.wav_ASR	and i cut them four pieces because you know mug on a sandwich through this tube
kurland05a_1270.32_5.5.wav_ASR	and then i you know put in the
kurland05a_1275.84_2.65.wav_ASR	and they control the sound in the bad
kurland05a_1278.506_3.21.wav_ASR	and i'm ready to go
kurland05b_50.075_4.4.wav_ASR	my speech is as you said it's probably you know
kurland05b_56.5_10.98.wav_ASR	if we go like on the railroad from ten ten ten ten bed you're trying my stroke it probably rains from three or four to seven
kurland05b_68.384_18.84.wav_ASR	and depending on you how much sleep i had and you how many cycles you know it could vary as you you know on a high side or so down as three or four
kurland05b_97.474_0.39.wav_ASR	oh yeah
kurland05b_101.171_8.37.wav_ASR	my stroke occurred in a sunday april thirtieth of my thanksgiving
kurland05b_110.667_3.95.wav_ASR	maybe third or fourth in the afternoon
kurland05b_115.886_5.05.wav_ASR	and i was taking my son firstnamek for ride in the truck
kurland05b_121.942_7.89.wav_ASR	and sometimes during right about your right hand it just didn't feel really good
kurland05b_131.038_7.6.wav_ASR	and but it didn't feel good at its level
kurland05b_138.764_4.16.wav_ASR	and i i knew something was wrong but that was temporary
kurland05b_144.024_7.14.wav_ASR	so that told my wife if i didn't see something to my eye the rest of the day
kurland05b_151.185_2.78.wav_ASR	and you know that night i would better
kurland05b_153.981_3.23.wav_ASR	and next morning monday
kurland05b_158.031_2.08.wav_ASR	you went to work you know like normal
kurland05b_161.057_5.69.wav_ASR	and drive me to work because my right side was affected
kurland05b_166.826_2.53.wav_ASR	that left side stroke from my right side was affected
kurland05b_169.989_2.67.wav_ASR	we kept driving off the side road
kurland05b_173.568_4.83.wav_ASR	and i got a massage from springfield to new york state
kurland05b_179.316_1.64.wav_ASR	and i kept going over the room stuff
kurland05b_182.108_9.76.wav_ASR	and then i knew a lot about me but just had something wrong in my speech and you know my verbal thing
kurland05b_191.892_5.03.wav_ASR	so i i picked some corn seed that i sold these two farmers
kurland05b_196.973_3.33.wav_ASR	and i got the cordite down my throat
kurland05b_200.538_0.84.wav_ASR	forty big bangs
kurland05b_201.657_1.03.wav_ASR	and then they came back
kurland05b_203.698_3.23.wav_ASR	and then i got up in the westfield
kurland05b_207.883_1.73.wav_ASR	they drove down the cinderella and i guess
kurland05b_210.089_2.3.wav_ASR	the same thing happened down there
kurland05b_212.464_1.61.wav_ASR	it was going up right after
kurland05b_215.133_5.91.wav_ASR	down in cinderella i went right up on my side with my truck
kurland05b_221.891_4.39.wav_ASR	at that point i figured something was really you know distracted from
kurland05b_226.335_2.1.wav_ASR	so i went home
kurland05b_229.055_2.63.wav_ASR	and about two o'clock i was home
kurland05b_231.708_2.62.wav_ASR	and then he was saying
kurland05b_234.375_2.94.wav_ASR	and the phone rang
kurland05b_237.33_1.8.wav_ASR	and so that's the rest of it
kurland05b_239.747_1.31.wav_ASR	you know the phone rings here
kurland05b_241.287_2.06.wav_ASR	my wife was like twelve feet away
kurland05b_244.599_0.87.wav_ASR	and they answered phone
kurland05b_245.491_5.89.wav_ASR	and i i think you set a law and maybe you know one or two words
kurland05b_251.454_3.41.wav_ASR	and whoever was on the line said
kurland05b_256.869_0.559.wav_ASR	and it was wrong
kurland05b_258.3_6.88.wav_ASR	and the person on the other side of my wife
kurland05b_266.088_0.42.wav_ASR	and she says
kurland05b_266.653_0.63.wav_ASR	thank you for the stroke
kurland05b_267.375_0.45.wav_ASR	so she says
kurland05b_268.156_0.55.wav_ASR	what's the reason for that
kurland05b_268.782_0.81.wav_ASR	so i says
kurland05b_269.867_0.57.wav_ASR	here i am
kurland05b_271.723_3.86.wav_ASR	and my wife was flooded out of the that i had you know the problem with it
kurland05b_275.899_1.1.wav_ASR	so went to hospital
kurland05b_277.016_4.1.wav_ASR	and you know they determined that i had a stroke
kurland05b_281.136_4.44.wav_ASR	but you know over three years so the cat was already outta bed
kurland05b_293.567_4.82.wav_ASR	you know i went to speech therapy in occupational therapy and physical therapy
kurland05b_298.403_8.73.wav_ASR	and the the p t and occupational therapy probably went to three four sessions each
kurland05b_307.193_2.73.wav_ASR	and then they you know they says
kurland05b_310.082_0.64.wav_ASR	you're okay
kurland05b_310.745_2.93.wav_ASR	you know you're sure of the ball
kurland05b_313.825_2.57.wav_ASR	and i remember the their rabbit like they're real bad
kurland05b_318.388_3.05.wav_ASR	so i was kicked a ball better with my right hand than i left hands
kurland05b_321.457_1.7.wav_ASR	so she says you know
kurland05b_323.705_0.63.wav_ASR	you covered it
kurland05b_324.657_3.95.wav_ASR	and then the speech therapy must have been part of probably three months
kurland05b_333.208_9.89.wav_ASR	and you know like a three when i started you know i maybe came up to a second or and you know seventeen or eight whatever
kurland05b_343.549_1.79.wav_ASR	and they could kindle plant growth
kurland05b_346.177_4.96.wav_ASR	and that's at that time near you know my speech therapist says
kurland05b_352.43_0.71.wav_ASR	you planted a seed
kurland05b_353.164_2.95.wav_ASR	you know so my my stop going to there
kurland05b_356.174_4.04.wav_ASR	and she she was right
kurland05b_360.291_2.51.wav_ASR	you know i never got my stroke fully back
kurland05b_370.449_0.36.wav_ASR	yeah
kurland05b_373.581_7.66.wav_ASR	but it's it's it's better but you know everywhere near where i was before
kurland05b_381.259_2.16.wav_ASR	alright i'll see
kurland05b_383.436_2.84.wav_ASR	and i'll you'll all tell joe his story
kurland05b_386.57_0.47.wav_ASR	and yeah
kurland05b_387.861_3.22.wav_ASR	you know i i was pretty good sick of not the brain
kurland05b_391.097_4.98.wav_ASR	you know i i became proud of me for you know the company they work for
kurland05b_396.1_1.46.wav_ASR	and yeah
kurland05b_401.115_6.28.wav_ASR	so after i had the stroke i continued to work because my hair ended up not because my hair didn't and not tear first
kurland05b_408.444_4.29.wav_ASR	and i went to a meeting out in new york state
kurland05b_413.53_1.25.wav_ASR	and someplace out west ernier
kurland05b_414.87_1.34.wav_ASR	and the beaver you know
kurland05b_416.983_7.74.wav_ASR	and anyway they had a class on the corn seed you know talking about corn and you know
kurland05b_425.712_2.42.wav_ASR	and they always asked me questions
kurland05b_428.562_3.89.wav_ASR	and they they couldn't answer the question forever all by myself you know
kurland05b_432.845_1.68.wav_ASR	and here i was supposta be in the emergency
kurland05b_435.581_2.4.wav_ASR	and it just my therapist
kurland05b_438.0_1.17.wav_ASR	and it was really annoying
kurland05b_440.451_5.79.wav_ASR	you know i i didn't grass much as useta grass you know stuff
kurland05b_448.71_3.71.wav_ASR	just every day you know like the twiggly my fingers
kurland05b_453.297_5.68.wav_ASR	so i took a horse care course you know safe horse care
kurland05b_459.001_5.15.wav_ASR	and you know i was one of the three people you know that i worked with
kurland05b_465.42_4.07.wav_ASR	and you know they were done a long time before i was there
kurland05b_470.732_2.86.wav_ASR	and that's the third time i've taken a test
kurland05b_473.683_3.87.wav_ASR	and you some of those people were there for the first time only
kurland05b_478.908_4.73.wav_ASR	so again it's you know not the same as before
kurland05b_486.315_0.97.wav_ASR	but she just loved it
kurland05b_487.3_0.41.wav_ASR	so
kurland05b_521.35_5.4.wav_ASR	and i useta tell the first story about my mind
kurland05b_528.086_12.14.wav_ASR	when i wasn't second grade you know a little kid so i was probably about eight years old i ended a contact by ten two

kurland05b_582.487_1.86.wav_ASR	you know took a lot of rides
kurland05b_584.365_5.0.wav_ASR	and you need me to tie a knot stuff

kurland05b_632.7_2.8.wav_ASR	and he kicks the ball to her
kurland05b_635.545_6.32.wav_ASR	and unfortunately he goes through the the window either his house or neighbor's house
kurland05b_642.769_3.78.wav_ASR	it lands in the trunk of the tree
kurland05b_646.929_1.83.wav_ASR	knocks over a lamp and smashes that
kurland05b_649.915_2.18.wav_ASR	and the guy who loses the rest of it
kurland05b_653.528_0.75.wav_ASR	you gotta try it
kurland05b_655.706_1.96.wav_ASR	and he looks outside

kurland05b_744.592_1.132.wav_ASR	yeah i didn't realize it was you know
kurland05b_755.253_4.52.wav_ASR	well a little girl's probably outta tricycle
kurland05b_759.794_2.18.wav_ASR	and so that was it
kurland05b_761.996_4.72.wav_ASR	and the dog chased the cat up a tree
kurland05b_768.041_7.81.wav_ASR	and then her father or some older gentleman tried the cat down in the tree
kurland05b_776.416_4.18.wav_ASR	and anyway the ladder falls down from the tree so he stuck too
kurland05b_781.781_5.59.wav_ASR	and then fire department come in with with second ladder to get the guy down and the cat down

kurland05b_950.444_4.35.wav_ASR	and something like something magical happened
kurland05b_955.569_3.66.wav_ASR	and he she got to go to the ball
kurland05b_960.256_15.48.wav_ASR	and in going to the ball she took a carriage that was made of a pumpkin and that was transformed some way or something like that

kurland05b_1024.992_3.069.wav_ASR	where where fit in the shoe would settle around
kurland05b_1028.833_4.409.wav_ASR	and they always cinderella fit into into the slipper

kurland05b_1074.939_11.48.wav_ASR	and then other on the other half i use grape juice juices because those make the best in terms of sweetness to me personally
kurland05b_1086.976_1.86.wav_ASR	my lawyer is on the other piece
kurland05b_1088.915_1.73.wav_ASR	and i just slap them together

202-2_2354.772_6.304.wav_ASR	so he's putting the soil in and water
202-2_2361.415_1.2.wav_ASR	what what what
202-2_2362.925_9.86.wav_ASR	but water is drippings and and dripping
202-2_2372.985_27.35.wav_ASR	but little little little little little is a little is seed is seedling and and growing the leaves leaves and turning the
202-2_2403.045_7.97.wav_ASR	but one month i think one month
202-2_2412.315_4.51.wav_ASR	and i'm one month i'm feeling the
202-2_2417.585_2.25.wav_ASR	and and that's it
71-1_11.65_2.76.wav_ASR	oh my goodness
71-1_14.65_0.62.wav_ASR	so i could be
71-1_16.35_1.349.wav_ASR	it would be the one to bring up
71-1_17.699_11.7.wav_ASR	you know i could just talk about the year that well nine months really when i was living in coma when i was nineteen
71-1_29.979_4.84.wav_ASR	and i did semester
71-1_38.11_8.87.wav_ASR	back in my generation you could actually go for two semesters which is why it was nine months
71-1_47.68_7.67.wav_ASR	what i did when i got to obituary we had this amazing which you could take classes at the university
71-1_56.18_2.36.wav_ASR	for the first semester i took class
71-1_59.16_2.453.wav_ASR	we had classes forever and four days of the week
71-1_61.8_1.661.wav_ASR	and three days of the week we could travel
71-1_64.1_7.4.wav_ASR	the second sister because i met this woman who became my best friend and it was her daughter she says
71-1_71.94_4.16.wav_ASR	you know we're our objective is really holding us back
71-1_76.94_18.32.wav_ASR	so i think what we should do is we should resist from the university take our ticket money because we get most of it in interest rates and then just spend the time traveling
71-1_95.93_13.06.wav_ASR	so i would say for those four months in which i actually had a dementia room that i could go back to denmark
71-1_110.29_3.419.wav_ASR	rocks as far south as we got
71-1_113.771_4.08.wav_ASR	italy frank sinai
71-1_119.131_2.676.wav_ASR	we spent a few more at a time traveling all over
71-1_121.911_2.231.wav_ASR	when you're nine teeth is a really good time to travel
71-1_124.491_2.854.wav_ASR	really good looking boys everywhere that you go
71-1_127.345_11.955.wav_ASR	and yeah i just had the most uncomfortable chair vacation designed the back of my mother says
71-1_139.525_1.2.wav_ASR	that's happening outta school
71-1_140.804_1.257.wav_ASR	oh that's terrible
71-1_142.165_0.882.wav_ASR	you didn't go back
71-1_143.59_1.381.wav_ASR	you know i'll go back next time
71-1_144.971_4.28.wav_ASR	but this is my opportunity to really travel abroad
71-1_149.791_2.56.wav_ASR	yeah as my friend firstnamem said to me
71-1_153.351_1.62.wav_ASR	the parents are back in wilkinson
71-1_155.291_0.913.wav_ASR	what are they gonna do
71-1_156.204_0.947.wav_ASR	where did we come from cuppa
71-1_157.791_1.89.wav_ASR	we're just gonna tell you what we're doing
71-1_160.22_5.0.wav_ASR	so you if i could tell you other stories but they would probably be sentences
71-1_165.44_2.1.wav_ASR	so we won't go into all the deep details
71-1_174.46_3.52.wav_ASR	it was iron because i met my father
71-1_178.1_6.44.wav_ASR	my father's family was only two generations from immigration to the united states
71-1_184.94_5.88.wav_ASR	and there in brown stone which is in the west coast of alaska
71-1_191.32_5.02.wav_ASR	so so i actually meet with other cousins second cousins
71-1_196.572_2.608.wav_ASR	and not sure what the exact relationship is
71-1_199.432_1.95.wav_ASR	but i met people that were part of my family
71-1_201.692_7.006.wav_ASR	and i had unicorns or second or third cousins that looked exactly like my father and my uncle
71-1_209.352_4.804.wav_ASR	yeah yeah that was the most uncomfortable i think yeah
71-1_236.89_0.84.wav_ASR	it comes and goes
71-1_238.25_4.65.wav_ASR	and i would say that the main problem with my language is that it's unresolved
71-1_243.73_5.13.wav_ASR	as i sat a few minutes ago i was talking about going up
71-1_249.84_4.21.wav_ASR	and what's interesting is that it's the valves that i have issues with
71-1_254.46_2.14.wav_ASR	but i could not say a broach
71-1_257.12_1.089.wav_ASR	hey i think i said bro
71-1_258.58_0.629.wav_ASR	and then i says
71-1_259.68_6.89.wav_ASR	but i was really thinking in my brain how to walk around that or feel that out of my own
71-1_267.01_2.96.wav_ASR	and i continued to visit with him
71-1_270.27_1.84.wav_ASR	and i didn't interact that happened
71-1_272.61_2.16.wav_ASR	but i better than i was
71-1_275.11_5.22.wav_ASR	and i still have difficulty with conceptual concepts
71-1_281.15_1.54.wav_ASR	and i still am
71-1_282.906_4.581.wav_ASR	and not that i haven't always been confused to other people
71-1_287.466_3.295.wav_ASR	and i do remember back what it was like when i was changing before the stroke
71-1_291.106_1.62.wav_ASR	and people would love puddles
71-1_293.566_0.577.wav_ASR	and then it was like
71-1_294.446_0.82.wav_ASR	that's their problem
71-1_295.586_5.857.wav_ASR	they look plenty a lot of times i'm pretty sure it's because i said something that didn't make any sense
71-1_301.443_11.647.wav_ASR	so i'm still trying to work on explaining concepts to people and trying to correct myself when i make a mistake about the others
71-1_313.523_6.04.wav_ASR	and i do contemporary speech on a regular basis
71-1_319.736_1.86.wav_ASR	so it's frustrating
71-1_321.916_8.864.wav_ASR	but i keep practicing it to the point that many people don't think i have aphasia until they do notice that i have aphasia
71-1_331.276_5.44.wav_ASR	so i continue but not well and not the way that i used to be able to communicate
71-1_347.09_0.959.wav_ASR	oh very much
71-1_348.131_1.199.wav_ASR	remember about it
71-1_350.191_0.82.wav_ASR	yeah yeah yeah
71-1_357.66_4.863.wav_ASR	well i didn't know that it was a stroke which is very tippy
71-1_363.04_1.71.wav_ASR	and remember i had one before so
71-1_364.78_1.964.wav_ASR	so how i know what a stroke was
71-1_366.88_4.114.wav_ASR	so i was a logistics worker working out
71-1_371.1_1.984.wav_ASR	but it was january fourth
71-1_373.42_4.0.wav_ASR	that was a day that when i you know that's the day when the restaurant stopped
71-1_377.8_1.688.wav_ASR	so i hafta get outta there
71-1_379.52_2.533.wav_ASR	and i need to start working out again harder than i've been
71-1_382.16_0.893.wav_ASR	and i was at a job
71-1_384.16_2.555.wav_ASR	and i worked the hell out man
71-1_386.84_1.385.wav_ASR	and i need i think i did eight months
71-1_388.82_3.88.wav_ASR	and my heart was up to like a hundred and seven
71-1_393.18_0.64.wav_ASR	okay
71-1_394.24_0.819.wav_ASR	and keep this side
71-1_395.34_2.9.wav_ASR	and yeah i i wasn't tied up
71-1_398.62_0.92.wav_ASR	and it wasn't fatigue
71-1_400.16_11.482.wav_ASR	and i got off the elevator and had double vision almost because the black pepper was on
71-1_412.0_1.26.wav_ASR	and i'm all wet
71-1_413.3_0.677.wav_ASR	but that was on
71-1_413.977_4.84.wav_ASR	and i thought i wanted to watch it because really like chatty
71-1_419.837_1.766.wav_ASR	but i was watching that
71-1_422.137_2.144.wav_ASR	and again i had double vision
71-1_425.157_2.023.wav_ASR	oh i just didn't feel good anymore
71-1_427.66_7.131.wav_ASR	went home and had a thunder cup headache right on my right side
71-1_434.94_0.52.wav_ASR	and i says
71-1_435.94_1.381.wav_ASR	yeah no idea what that was
71-1_437.76_2.145.wav_ASR	so i crated it in at to sleep
71-1_440.66_2.93.wav_ASR	the next day i couldn't work it on
71-1_443.78_1.7.wav_ASR	it was trying to right a conflict problem
71-1_445.86_0.64.wav_ASR	nothing would
71-1_446.77_1.3.wav_ASR	and i couldn't do work
71-1_449.31_3.735.wav_ASR	so i went to my head my head cut the next day
71-1_453.11_3.247.wav_ASR	and i wanted to cancel because i had a really bad headache
71-1_456.67_2.13.wav_ASR	but if you cant pay for it you hadta pay for it
71-1_459.29_1.889.wav_ASR	and my hair would be cut
71-1_461.93_0.942.wav_ASR	so i came back
71-1_462.93_1.662.wav_ASR	and i live alone
71-1_464.592_2.463.wav_ASR	so i hadn't really talked to anybody in two days
71-1_467.512_1.658.wav_ASR	he down in the tree
71-1_469.572_2.734.wav_ASR	and i couldn't tell her how i wanted to get my haircut
71-1_473.192_2.18.wav_ASR	and i couldn't say anything
71-1_476.352_4.42.wav_ASR	so i couldn't tell her that i'd been sweating sweat
71-1_481.512_1.76.wav_ASR	and i don't know what was coming
71-1_483.692_0.608.wav_ASR	and i was tall
71-1_484.66_2.06.wav_ASR	and she was nodding and smiling
71-1_486.78_1.691.wav_ASR	but she had no idea what i was talking about
71-1_489.8_0.46.wav_ASR	oh i says
71-1_490.62_1.01.wav_ASR	oh something's wrong
71-1_492.54_1.8.wav_ASR	so i told her
71-1_494.62_0.3.wav_ASR	and i says
71-1_495.129_0.678.wav_ASR	you're here
71-1_497.02_2.56.wav_ASR	so she luckily she didn't have hit his head
71-1_499.94_1.89.wav_ASR	but she cut her hair the way i did
71-1_502.08_0.3.wav_ASR	and i says
71-1_502.46_3.93.wav_ASR	you know i'll be able to go a doctor because this doesn't make any sense
71-1_507.5_2.1.wav_ASR	so i i tried
71-1_510.16_4.24.wav_ASR	and i think this is something that must have happened with people that have strokes is that they
71-1_516.46_3.62.wav_ASR	but i looked up the number that i was sposta call emergency
71-1_520.22_1.589.wav_ASR	and this was already six o'clock
71-1_522.35_2.64.wav_ASR	and it had all of these chickens
71-1_526.21_3.46.wav_ASR	if it's an immediate emergency go call nine one one
71-1_530.13_0.33.wav_ASR	and i thought
71-1_530.61_0.757.wav_ASR	and he says you know
71-1_531.59_3.737.wav_ASR	and i just wanna make a point in going into the engineering college tomorrow morning
71-1_536.11_0.706.wav_ASR	and then it says
71-1_537.11_3.2.wav_ASR	if it's this situation call nine one one
71-1_540.703_4.014.wav_ASR	and if it's this situation called you know dress three
71-1_545.023_2.16.wav_ASR	and if it's this situation call nine one one
71-1_548.083_3.82.wav_ASR	and apparently if you stayed on for two and a half minutes they finally say
71-1_552.343_1.811.wav_ASR	real person will come on the line
71-1_555.283_1.601.wav_ASR	but my head really hurt
71-1_557.243_0.593.wav_ASR	and i'm just going
71-1_557.903_1.16.wav_ASR	so this is help
71-1_559.46_2.24.wav_ASR	so i hung up the phone and said
71-1_561.9_1.13.wav_ASR	we'll just get up tomorrow
71-1_563.38_2.36.wav_ASR	and i'll see if i anybody will answer the phone
71-1_566.68_1.06.wav_ASR	but i told my doctor
71-1_568.34_4.12.wav_ASR	and she she was very frightened
71-1_573.0_0.6.wav_ASR	and she says
71-1_573.7_1.12.wav_ASR	don't sound like yourself
71-1_576.13_1.22.wav_ASR	you needta go take an ambulance
71-1_577.9_1.29.wav_ASR	how gonna pay for an ambulance
71-1_579.24_0.78.wav_ASR	and so rich
71-1_580.52_1.22.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
71-1_581.84_0.82.wav_ASR	and i just have a headache
71-1_582.9_2.28.wav_ASR	and i don't wanna spend that much
71-1_586.02_6.16.wav_ASR	and they called the fire department
71-1_592.48_0.8.wav_ASR	he's in heaven
71-1_593.56_2.263.wav_ASR	and she's just finishing school up there
71-1_596.04_2.585.wav_ASR	but she they called the fire department in massachusetts
71-1_598.625_1.419.wav_ASR	and and they says
71-1_601.165_2.74.wav_ASR	but technically this is slipper
71-1_604.725_1.16.wav_ASR	but this is her situation
71-1_606.385_0.335.wav_ASR	and they say
71-1_607.54_1.23.wav_ASR	it sounds like she's having a stroke
71-1_609.285_2.315.wav_ASR	and she needs to get to emergency
71-1_613.76_1.04.wav_ASR	and and they says
71-1_614.845_1.205.wav_ASR	but she doesn't wanna go
71-1_616.36_0.52.wav_ASR	and they says
71-1_616.96_5.542.wav_ASR	all of a sudden i know is i'm living on my you know getting ready to teach something
71-1_623.14_4.643.wav_ASR	and i heard people running up the stairs outside my my apartment
71-1_628.28_4.927.wav_ASR	and then just over there's really good fireman by the way
71-1_633.62_2.12.wav_ASR	hey i think it must be the university
71-1_636.04_0.645.wav_ASR	and i'm all messed up
71-1_637.365_1.928.wav_ASR	and i answered the door
71-1_639.285_1.265.wav_ASR	and i told them that
71-1_640.825_1.38.wav_ASR	oh i didn't have
71-1_642.545_1.252.wav_ASR	but i didn't know what was going on
71-1_644.165_1.173.wav_ASR	but i couldn't talk
71-1_646.805_1.205.wav_ASR	do you needta come with us right now
71-1_648.285_0.355.wav_ASR	and i says
71-1_648.745_0.913.wav_ASR	well no i'll take you
71-1_650.705_0.335.wav_ASR	and they says
71-1_651.417_0.908.wav_ASR	you can't drive
71-1_653.105_1.585.wav_ASR	oh i'm gonna go to mexico today
71-1_654.885_1.437.wav_ASR	oh you're gonna go this right now
71-1_656.32_0.62.wav_ASR	and i said
71-1_657.32_0.817.wav_ASR	alright
71-1_658.28_2.28.wav_ASR	let me get my coat and all the other stuff
71-1_660.88_3.715.wav_ASR	and yeah all of a sudden i got into the emergency room
71-1_664.74_1.961.wav_ASR	but it was just this huge
71-1_667.8_1.86.wav_ASR	it was racing around and yelling
71-1_670.22_6.1.wav_ASR	and all of a sudden they called nine one one and came out and said
71-1_676.5_1.02.wav_ASR	yeah you had a stroke
71-1_678.32_2.727.wav_ASR	so i asked the doctor if i could meet you
71-1_681.06_3.681.wav_ASR	and he showed me on the cat's skin exactly what it had happened
71-1_685.44_3.23.wav_ASR	and they admitted
71-1_689.38_2.962.wav_ASR	so that's how i hadta have a stroke
71-1_692.75_6.56.wav_ASR	yeah i i really have no issues whatsoever with my mouth muscle weakness weak
71-1_699.81_1.65.wav_ASR	but i hid it on my phone
71-1_702.78_2.04.wav_ASR	and i just didn't know about the headache
71-1_705.03_0.95.wav_ASR	we never had one again
71-1_706.88_1.18.wav_ASR	never had my phone
71-1_708.53_7.93.wav_ASR	but apparently if you get a really bad headache that hits you on the side of the head it means you should probably go to the emergency room
71-1_717.45_2.54.wav_ASR	yeah i don't know if that gave you
71-1_720.582_1.363.wav_ASR	they don't give you a lot of insight
71-1_722.34_8.435.wav_ASR	again if i'd remembered right after i'd had it out when i had the headache they could stop it
71-1_731.3_3.77.wav_ASR	the wind the window of opportunity hadta come
71-1_737.18_5.617.wav_ASR	but it wasn't a severe stroke not a mrg stroke not a hemorrhagic stroke
71-1_743.84_6.846.wav_ASR	and they ultimately decided it was crippled because they've not been able to find out why i had it
71-1_751.22_7.24.wav_ASR	all of my numbers are medical numbers are good
71-1_758.94_0.8.wav_ASR	and not died
71-1_760.32_0.82.wav_ASR	and i don't smoke
71-1_762.02_1.88.wav_ASR	and i have low blood pressure
71-1_764.42_2.25.wav_ASR	everything looks good
71-1_767.76_1.39.wav_ASR	but i didn't deal have a stroke
71-1_769.54_2.64.wav_ASR	so something happened somewhere
71-1_772.78_3.16.wav_ASR	and in the hospital i got to watch the ultrasound
71-1_776.46_0.954.wav_ASR	and it is
71-1_780.18_0.96.wav_ASR	me you know right
71-1_781.58_4.48.wav_ASR	yeah so two years later here
71-1_797.2_17.56.wav_ASR	well again if i ever get to the point that i'm articulized aphasia and and research and do something more about getting people some kind of treatment
71-1_814.772_2.553.wav_ASR	and i was giving myself nothing
71-1_817.552_3.086.wav_ASR	particularly i think it was because
71-1_820.772_2.485.wav_ASR	and it really mattered as much as a major city
71-1_823.472_6.42.wav_ASR	so i should've been able to get the best type of help there
71-1_830.372_0.477.wav_ASR	and i did
71-1_830.849_4.78.wav_ASR	and the best i could get was we found two speech therapists
71-1_836.569_2.232.wav_ASR	one of them only specialized children
71-1_839.189_1.351.wav_ASR	so i didn't work with him
71-1_840.909_0.92.wav_ASR	they other person seems
71-1_842.229_4.18.wav_ASR	and it was really one hour a week
71-1_847.59_16.523.wav_ASR	and basically because i am an accountant because i have the ability to read confidential checks and because that part of my brain wasn't affected without any way i hadta do my own research
71-1_864.29_2.08.wav_ASR	and i hadta do a lot of breathing exercises
71-1_866.55_4.28.wav_ASR	and the the speech pathology specialist would not provide therapy therapy
71-1_871.09_0.612.wav_ASR	and he didn't fit
71-1_872.39_3.118.wav_ASR	but she i mean she helped me a lot i would say
71-1_875.61_2.902.wav_ASR	so i should be looking up on this particular thing
71-1_878.63_2.25.wav_ASR	and i should be living in picard's time
71-1_881.53_3.02.wav_ASR	and but she hadn't kept up with it either
71-1_884.71_4.16.wav_ASR	and she hadn't learned about some of the most recent treatments that were available
71-1_889.53_7.52.wav_ASR	so basically what i did is i went back to exercise as soon as they allowed me
71-1_897.35_2.7.wav_ASR	but i couldn't work out for three months
71-1_900.34_5.67.wav_ASR	and i could only walk because they were concerned that my physical ability had nothing to do with the stroke
71-1_906.42_0.66.wav_ASR	and she says
71-1_909.64_1.189.wav_ASR	yeah i just hadta walk
71-1_911.14_1.081.wav_ASR	and i had
71-1_913.2_1.401.wav_ASR	they tested me for m s
71-1_914.74_3.28.wav_ASR	and i hadta wear this waterproof on for about three months
71-1_918.17_2.86.wav_ASR	but i don't have a fit either so
71-1_921.33_2.315.wav_ASR	but i focus on dying
71-1_924.37_4.82.wav_ASR	and i really wasn't drinking much alcohol at all
71-1_930.27_1.38.wav_ASR	oh i stopped to compute
71-1_932.87_2.66.wav_ASR	so now i'm back excited as much as i can
71-1_935.83_2.18.wav_ASR	and i'm really careful in terms of my diet
71-1_938.49_7.52.wav_ASR	and i really focus on information limiting it in terms of my diet and what i
71-1_947.57_2.29.wav_ASR	and i write every day
71-1_950.51_1.38.wav_ASR	alcohol every day
71-1_951.89_3.934.wav_ASR	but now i'm trying to write an article which i hope to get published
71-1_955.824_20.3.wav_ASR	that's maybe the hardest thing from my brain that've done before the stroke or after the stroke or whether it's the ability to weigh arithmetic type of accuracy
71-1_976.405_1.819.wav_ASR	so tomorrow's a tough day
71-1_978.345_9.56.wav_ASR	and i read aloud every day the news papers because i think same words is a way of reading those
71-1_988.605_2.865.wav_ASR	whether it's the fires that were there
71-1_991.665_2.454.wav_ASR	but i just needta relearn how to say word
71-1_994.405_0.82.wav_ASR	it's like i'm rich
71-1_995.479_4.388.wav_ASR	and i'll probably be able to say that a lot for a long time until the whole week
71-1_999.919_4.279.wav_ASR	and then i'll miss miss that one again
71-1_1005.119_5.531.wav_ASR	but that's really all i know is keeping it up in terms of
71-1_1011.439_0.611.wav_ASR	and sleeping
71-1_1012.379_2.191.wav_ASR	and i always sleep
71-1_1014.87_2.86.wav_ASR	meally have gone without it an hour
71-1_1018.68_1.81.wav_ASR	you know if you stay late you do something
71-1_1020.89_3.12.wav_ASR	but you hafta get up because you've got stuff to do
71-1_1024.67_8.638.wav_ASR	they tried to make sure i always have at least eight or nine hours a week hours a hour hours a day to be able to sleep
71-1_1033.308_3.68.wav_ASR	and that seems to be something that i didn't do before
71-1_1037.181_1.688.wav_ASR	and now i really do need to do
71-1_1038.968_2.762.wav_ASR	but that's all i'm doing
71-1_1042.028_0.872.wav_ASR	and i'm still working
71-1_1043.248_1.404.wav_ASR	but i'm not able to teach
71-1_1045.089_3.024.wav_ASR	you can see what i would be in ninety minutes
71-1_1048.268_0.89.wav_ASR	they getting front of the clock
71-1_1049.328_0.769.wav_ASR	and they started talking
71-1_1050.288_0.602.wav_ASR	that people would be like
71-1_1051.388_0.52.wav_ASR	and yeah
71-1_1052.271_0.5.wav_ASR	and yeah
71-1_1054.451_1.998.wav_ASR	so maybe that'll come up
71-1_1056.791_0.58.wav_ASR	alright i can do it
71-1_1058.051_3.74.wav_ASR	and i could teach through online stuff
71-1_1062.471_2.149.wav_ASR	so so far i'm just doing other stuff
71-1_1064.971_1.119.wav_ASR	but i did love teaching
71-1_1067.49_1.36.wav_ASR	we'll see if i get back to it again
71-1_1069.371_0.419.wav_ASR	and i don't know
71-1_1070.87_1.35.wav_ASR	and anyway so that's what i do
71-1_1072.81_4.64.wav_ASR	and i think doing it constantly is really important
71-1_1077.79_2.66.wav_ASR	and i just kept pushing myself to do different things
71-1_1081.13_6.08.wav_ASR	there's literally nothing that i'm not forcing myself to
71-1_1087.51_0.909.wav_ASR	and not forcing myself
71-1_1088.69_2.265.wav_ASR	and certain things i go through every single day
71-1_1091.81_2.36.wav_ASR	hey i do yq every night
71-1_1094.51_1.1.wav_ASR	and i think that's useful
71-1_1096.57_1.69.wav_ASR	and i don't know
71-1_1098.26_19.94.wav_ASR	again i'm always looking at research allways trying to find something that's going to improve my hearing and some way or to the experience that's that was is is that was difficult to repair though that's that's is is what it was described
71-1_1119.04_7.42.wav_ASR	well i spent a few mom trying to figure out why a right hand person with a stroke on the right side ended up with aphasia
71-1_1127.38_10.66.wav_ASR	but i mean other than the fact that it doesn't qualify me for many clinical trials
71-1_1138.248_3.801.wav_ASR	other than that i guess i just don't wear it all that much
71-1_1142.228_13.0.wav_ASR	and i'm just doing what i can to try to heal and recover to be able to take hold
71-1_1155.48_9.755.wav_ASR	so i do understand that at my age in my sixties the health issues last like as hearing is
71-1_1165.72_1.66.wav_ASR	so i don't know
71-1_1167.66_0.67.wav_ASR	we'll see what
71-1_1168.91_6.48.wav_ASR	but just watch it every day this experience in work or this work in general seems to me
71-1_1175.93_2.077.wav_ASR	how it comes out and how it doesn't come out
71-1_1178.67_1.08.wav_ASR	we'll see yeah
71-1_1179.91_1.98.wav_ASR	and a lot of people don't know i have aphasia
71-1_1182.17_12.68.wav_ASR	and i like keeping it that way because the there is a smogachtatt attack to having a disability
71-1_1196.42_8.392.wav_ASR	after people think i might speak very carefully around me they think that they hafta speak very carefully around me
71-1_1205.08_4.784.wav_ASR	so i i'd rather just see if i can just wrap it
71-1_1210.7_3.66.wav_ASR	so yeah very few people know that i have that i have aphasia
71-1_1214.592_1.416.wav_ASR	the family members know
71-1_1216.008_3.437.wav_ASR	but i don't tell anyone else about it
71-1_1219.768_1.825.wav_ASR	that just try to figure it out
71-1_1242.33_1.36.wav_ASR	and it should be something important
71-1_1246.83_4.6.wav_ASR	well you know i i guess i would
71-1_1251.764_12.94.wav_ASR	so something that i would say as being very important for me was working with an m s engineer who
71-1_1266.024_2.112.wav_ASR	and i'm very close to water
71-1_1268.136_3.957.wav_ASR	and i met adrian here about ten years ago
71-1_1273.036_2.404.wav_ASR	and probably more fifteen years at this point
71-1_1276.336_2.78.wav_ASR	and i was teaching at a university
71-1_1279.476_1.38.wav_ASR	and i invited her to
71-1_1280.996_6.4.wav_ASR	that was the issue of the late tracheotomy because my resection is on stage three
71-1_1287.93_7.06.wav_ASR	and i had invited her to come and speak in one of my classes
71-1_1295.79_0.926.wav_ASR	and she came down
71-1_1297.17_2.48.wav_ASR	and we hit it off with each other
71-1_1300.24_3.96.wav_ASR	and she was one of the most remarkable people that i've ever met
71-1_1304.73_5.19.wav_ASR	and she was the oldest in a family of a legal
71-1_1310.55_3.42.wav_ASR	and she grew up on the american resistance without running watch
71-1_1315.01_5.11.wav_ASR	so she was the first person to get a college degree from her truck
71-1_1321.04_3.68.wav_ASR	and she became the first female triathlete
71-1_1325.92_7.08.wav_ASR	and in the last ten years we've gone on trips together
71-1_1333.92_3.12.wav_ASR	and generally because as she's getting older she's entering age
71-1_1337.32_0.87.wav_ASR	so she lets me do it
71-1_1339.05_7.74.wav_ASR	and you go to different events or different hearings in which she's going to offer testimony
71-1_1347.67_7.05.wav_ASR	and what i've learned from hanging out with this woman who's interested is the word i would use
71-1_1355.21_1.06.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
71-1_1356.984_2.503.wav_ASR	and she doesn't see that well anymore
71-1_1359.704_1.4.wav_ASR	he has trouble reading anymore
71-1_1361.57_3.02.wav_ASR	but she has me right speech for her
71-1_1365.124_1.586.wav_ASR	and she gets up in protest
71-1_1366.71_12.02.wav_ASR	and she refuses to to take she refuses to to listen to the the response no
71-1_1379.45_3.74.wav_ASR	and she will find way to powder on through
71-1_1384.07_3.535.wav_ASR	and she gets things done that other people have not done
71-1_1387.89_9.96.wav_ASR	and why i see this is important is my own mother is very careful and believe that you do fear to men
71-1_1398.43_12.315.wav_ASR	and hanging out with a lady about what it means to be a great deal about what it means to worry about if you say something
71-1_1411.09_1.635.wav_ASR	and just get up
71-1_1412.95_0.663.wav_ASR	we say your tree
71-1_1414.29_1.84.wav_ASR	and protect your test sample
71-1_1416.263_8.47.wav_ASR	and push every letter that you can leave to be able to get things through that you wanna get through
71-1_1424.733_14.14.wav_ASR	so working with a lady over the last couple years we've been able to stop a mind from the hands which would've been side effects
71-1_1440.7_6.776.wav_ASR	so she has been my insurance in terms of what i've learned from her
71-1_1447.78_1.68.wav_ASR	yeah so that was really fun
71-1_1449.92_2.26.wav_ASR	so there's that's the other thing
71-1_1452.86_0.96.wav_ASR	and so yeah
71-1_1454.02_6.652.wav_ASR	see she's been an on going sort of important person for me i think to monitor myself after
71-1_1514.123_7.78.wav_ASR	well i mean it looks like a big with a boy who's playing with a soccer ball
71-1_1522.3_7.984.wav_ASR	and he's just stuck in his own probably in his yard because this is something he's really interested in doing
71-1_1530.81_8.77.wav_ASR	and he kicked the ball maybe a little bit too hard properly than he wants
71-1_1540.7_3.8.wav_ASR	and it broke into the window next door
71-1_1545.58_2.64.wav_ASR	and unfortunately he broke the window
71-1_1549.0_11.31.wav_ASR	and the ball came through the window right next to the chair where his next door neighbor a man is sitting on his chair
71-1_1561.7_4.32.wav_ASR	so he's obviously really upset about this because he could've been heard
71-1_1566.34_1.16.wav_ASR	and the glass is broken
71-1_1568.22_1.04.wav_ASR	and it's in his yard
71-1_1569.74_1.088.wav_ASR	and it shouldn't happen
71-1_1571.64_7.02.wav_ASR	and so he grabs the chair looks out the window to find the correct who did this to him
71-1_1578.75_3.64.wav_ASR	and now they're going to be some kind of
71-1_1582.51_3.18.wav_ASR	he's gonna need some rehabilitation that are made in a pool
71-1_1585.938_20.64.wav_ASR	he looks like he's about ready to head over grab the boy's porch to try to figure out how the window would be paid for how he would stay away from the window's window
71-1_1623.92_0.5.wav_ASR	and yeah
71-1_1624.855_4.46.wav_ASR	well it looks as if this little
71-1_1630.595_1.88.wav_ASR	let's see
71-1_1632.686_1.727.wav_ASR	that actually it could be kinda funny
71-1_1635.675_3.5.wav_ASR	and i can't decide if it's male or female
71-1_1639.515_3.031.wav_ASR	and she lived life best ever
71-1_1643.288_9.44.wav_ASR	they's getting ready to head out to the labor somewhere some trip somewhere
71-1_1653.76_5.85.wav_ASR	and their mother looked outside and said
71-1_1660.248_1.642.wav_ASR	you know i think we're gonna see some rain
71-1_1662.48_1.17.wav_ASR	you might need the umbrella
71-1_1664.82_1.11.wav_ASR	but this child says
71-1_1666.34_1.55.wav_ASR	we don't need an umbrella
71-1_1668.44_1.2.wav_ASR	and i mean this is ridiculous
71-1_1669.94_0.6.wav_ASR	we're not gonna rain
71-1_1670.78_1.68.wav_ASR	and i don't really care about getting wet
71-1_1672.82_0.87.wav_ASR	you know i don't
71-1_1674.76_0.73.wav_ASR	yeah i'm not sure
71-1_1675.74_1.68.wav_ASR	and i don't melt when the water hits
71-1_1678.28_1.97.wav_ASR	so this this children
71-1_1680.78_0.88.wav_ASR	and leaving anyway
71-1_1681.66_1.72.wav_ASR	hey he's trying to find her
71-1_1683.529_1.775.wav_ASR	and immediately began to rain
71-1_1686.38_1.31.wav_ASR	all of sudden suddenly
71-1_1688.02_4.78.wav_ASR	hey i'm getting rained rubbed in my eyes
71-1_1693.33_1.4.wav_ASR	and i'm getting really wet
71-1_1695.36_1.22.wav_ASR	and this is not it
71-1_1697.22_2.14.wav_ASR	and i didn't understand that it was getting in my eyes
71-1_1700.24_4.96.wav_ASR	so i immediately headed back because it was raining much harder than i thought it was
71-1_1706.08_0.654.wav_ASR	locked in
71-1_1706.84_0.896.wav_ASR	and set to my mother
71-1_1708.14_1.485.wav_ASR	and i just looked at her
71-1_1710.54_2.22.wav_ASR	and she arrived knew that i was right
71-1_1713.18_11.1.wav_ASR	the mother immediately understood that while it was very difficult for this child to ask for it or to acknowledge that they were wrong
71-1_1725.08_5.08.wav_ASR	they did make clear that they did need need an umbrella if they were gonna walk to life
71-1_1730.64_3.56.wav_ASR	so the mother then gave them the umbrella
71-1_1734.68_10.14.wav_ASR	and they went back on their way with an umbrella remembering at this point that maybe mother's actually knowing what they're talking about
71-1_1761.65_0.5.wav_ASR	and yeah
71-1_1762.547_29.94.wav_ASR	well what happened is that the cat that beyond the tree and ended to get off the tree but no longer knew how to get back from the end of the branch that
71-1_1800.778_0.579.wav_ASR	help me
71-1_1802.158_0.382.wav_ASR	me
71-1_1802.54_6.1.wav_ASR	and the little girl is obviously just really excited about the situation of her cat
71-1_1808.838_1.772.wav_ASR	and she's very worried about getting her cat up
71-1_1811.358_5.082.wav_ASR	so she began by going to her father and saying
71-1_1816.78_4.1.wav_ASR	can you please help me get the cat out of the tree
71-1_1820.94_4.437.wav_ASR	and the father says
71-1_1825.6_0.417.wav_ASR	cornish haddock
71-1_1826.1_18.22.wav_ASR	and he grabbed his ladder and climbed up to the the the limb where the cat was because those branches are to fragile
71-1_1845.67_8.6.wav_ASR	he also included kicked off the ladder which then puts him back in the situation that he needs to be rescued
71-1_1855.03_5.868.wav_ASR	so at this point the dog is now barking because the dog wants the father to get out of the tree
71-1_1861.6_10.368.wav_ASR	the barking of the dog is making it more difficult for the cat to be able to enter its way back down to the trunk
71-1_1872.9_8.052.wav_ASR	so so the little girl is still really stressed because her child her cat is here
71-1_1880.952_2.68.wav_ASR	that's a scenario aphasia area
71-1_1883.772_0.899.wav_ASR	and make that all the time
71-1_1885.192_3.057.wav_ASR	it's really wants her cat to be able to get out
71-1_1888.249_17.88.wav_ASR	so they called the fire department to come down and not just rescue the cat but also rescue the ladder since he now needs also
71-1_1906.179_13.419.wav_ASR	but it apparently shows that the father was really trying to do what his daughter wanted him to in terms of helping out the cat out of the tree
71-1_1939.75_0.39.wav_ASR	shut up
71-1_2104.158_2.744.wav_ASR	well i'll keep the feefit cut at bit
71-1_2107.478_3.16.wav_ASR	and i'll all do my stuff around
71-1_2113.118_0.492.wav_ASR	okay
71-1_2113.85_8.89.wav_ASR	and cinderella is she's the daughter of a widow
71-1_2123.66_2.76.wav_ASR	her mother has been called
71-1_2127.23_2.66.wav_ASR	and so the two of them are okay
71-1_2131.04_13.9.wav_ASR	and the her father decided that it would be really helpful for his daughter if he could provide a mother for his daughter cinderella
71-1_2146.02_1.74.wav_ASR	so he met this slipper
71-1_2149.12_2.03.wav_ASR	but i don't know that we've ever heard her name
71-1_2151.74_3.0.wav_ASR	but anyway otherwise normal as usual
71-1_2155.58_6.48.wav_ASR	and made very clear that she would be a wonderful mother to cinderella
71-1_2162.44_1.851.wav_ASR	so she also had two daughters of her own
71-1_2165.48_1.34.wav_ASR	so they they
71-1_2167.42_10.34.wav_ASR	and unfortunately the way that cinderella was treated was not appropriate
71-1_2178.36_5.417.wav_ASR	and she was not treated the same way that the stepmothers were treated
71-1_2183.777_4.48.wav_ASR	and in step she was used as as a maid
71-1_2188.336_5.469.wav_ASR	and i've no idea where her father is in this whole picture and why he's not doing anything about this
71-1_2194.037_3.593.wav_ASR	but maybe he's struggling or whatever
71-1_2197.83_17.72.wav_ASR	but he's left the management of her daughter to the stepmother who treats her very badly doesn't treat her the same and has given the message that it is fine to her daughter's door
71-1_2216.67_10.5.wav_ASR	so she effectively becomes the maid to these to these stepsisters and to a stepmom
71-1_2228.39_5.92.wav_ASR	but she she's a very very sweet young woman
71-1_2235.23_16.92.wav_ASR	and she has found way to also have happiness and stability issues with the animals as a matter of itself is a mad is mad
71-1_2252.39_1.84.wav_ASR	so she sings too
71-1_2255.14_0.93.wav_ASR	they loved her
71-1_2256.32_5.39.wav_ASR	and she's close to the the horses the other animals
71-1_2262.1_9.26.wav_ASR	and she dreams about being in a better situation where she's loved and is treated with more respect than she is
71-1_2271.67_11.59.wav_ASR	oh she's so quite beautiful which is certainly one of the reasons why the stepsisters are so mean to her because they are
71-1_2284.39_18.53.wav_ASR	but while this is going on in this household the king of the kingdom has made it clear to his son that it's time to retire
71-1_2303.08_7.52.wav_ASR	and he'd like to hand down the king to his son
71-1_2311.32_1.88.wav_ASR	but first his son hasta marry
71-1_2313.84_2.509.wav_ASR	and he doesn't really watch
71-1_2316.62_1.587.wav_ASR	he's not interested in anything
71-1_2318.34_1.38.wav_ASR	you're not dating anyone
71-1_2320.22_3.01.wav_ASR	but the plan is that this is his duty
71-1_2324.16_3.094.wav_ASR	so it was kind of like the prince hurray of that time
71-1_2327.3_3.0.wav_ASR	the stair and not wheelchair
71-1_2331.06_5.74.wav_ASR	but in any case of the plant is gonna be a giant ball at dawn
71-1_2336.832_13.545.wav_ASR	and all of all the eligible which i guess means of challenging years are supposed to show up at this dance so that he can pick the one that he wants
71-1_2350.732_4.303.wav_ASR	and again we will not get into the fabricate of how this all worked
71-1_2356.58_2.034.wav_ASR	initially the word gets out
71-1_2359.36_6.948.wav_ASR	and the two stepsisters are just really excited about this idea because they the right age
71-1_2366.94_9.235.wav_ASR	because their mother had married cinderella's father who makes a fair money they can dress really well
71-1_2376.175_11.163.wav_ASR	they can really get dressed up to go to this dance and see if they could be the one that would attract the the attention of the prince
71-1_2388.615_1.676.wav_ASR	senior wants to go
71-1_2390.815_3.322.wav_ASR	and she also reads about this that is coming out
71-1_2394.137_3.18.wav_ASR	and that she knows she's eligible because she's the right age
71-1_2397.537_6.18.wav_ASR	and i guess she's of that nationality or whatever criterion they're used
71-1_2404.5_6.33.wav_ASR	but her stepmother kind of makes clear that no she's not invited to go
71-1_2411.78_5.16.wav_ASR	and she's not gonna be able to go to stores and buy clothes the way that her mom would
71-1_2417.82_2.25.wav_ASR	so she tries to make something on her own
71-1_2420.4_3.38.wav_ASR	she tried to take the materials in the ragged that were available to her
71-1_2424.24_4.62.wav_ASR	he looks up how to make them in a walk
71-1_2429.36_1.08.wav_ASR	that was on page eleven
71-1_2430.56_1.38.wav_ASR	and i think that was you helping me
71-1_2432.61_1.33.wav_ASR	and she comes up with a dress
71-1_2434.24_1.5.wav_ASR	and of course she looks amazing
71-1_2436.71_9.244.wav_ASR	and i guess where pretty in pink the fellow with a mug with a name she got away with it
71-1_2446.2_1.78.wav_ASR	but this is not it
71-1_2449.65_1.12.wav_ASR	and this is cinderella
71-1_2450.992_2.458.wav_ASR	so her mother laughed at her and says
71-1_2453.57_1.49.wav_ASR	we're not going out with those clothes
71-1_2455.45_2.61.wav_ASR	and her stepsisters match her
71-1_2458.95_2.32.wav_ASR	and she's out in the barn by herself
71-1_2462.19_9.66.wav_ASR	and all of a sudden this fairy godmother shows up based on one of her wishes
71-1_2472.03_2.42.wav_ASR	but i wish i could go to the ball
71-1_2475.65_12.128.wav_ASR	and she the reason that her stepmother is showing up is because she knows that cinderella is a really sweet young girl
71-1_2488.53_2.041.wav_ASR	and she cares about everybody else
71-1_2490.87_1.674.wav_ASR	and she does things for everybody else
71-1_2492.544_4.96.wav_ASR	and because of the procedure of her heart she develops this chance
71-1_2498.584_2.36.wav_ASR	so she uses her magical power
71-1_2502.18_6.324.wav_ASR	and she not only treats a dress for her that is incredibly rare
71-1_2509.124_2.72.wav_ASR	you could go to the oscars with us
71-1_2511.9_14.753.wav_ASR	but she also transforms the mice into horses and the pumpkin into carriage to be able to take her so that she can get there
71-1_2526.84_2.1.wav_ASR	and she could ride in style
71-1_2529.78_4.64.wav_ASR	so cinderella is very very happy hugs her
71-1_2534.78_0.88.wav_ASR	and her mother said
71-1_2535.86_5.98.wav_ASR	remember this only will last this dream until midnight
71-1_2542.26_4.463.wav_ASR	at midnight your dress will go back to your rag
71-1_2546.723_5.94.wav_ASR	your horses will be transformed back into
71-1_2554.163_6.318.wav_ASR	and the coach will be transported back into a pumpkin
71-1_2561.13_0.573.wav_ASR	and she says
71-1_2561.943_0.442.wav_ASR	so i know
71-1_2562.423_0.792.wav_ASR	thank you very much
71-1_2563.463_3.157.wav_ASR	so she she hadta the
71-1_2567.38_17.24.wav_ASR	and of course because she is so elated and shows up with this really real type of carriage she's treated as royal her
71-1_2584.975_2.916.wav_ASR	and she the footmen open the door
71-1_2588.095_0.812.wav_ASR	they help her too
71-1_2589.635_0.812.wav_ASR	and she walks in there
71-1_2590.635_2.32.wav_ASR	and immediately the prince just like
71-1_2593.435_0.658.wav_ASR	it's like that
71-1_2594.515_2.3.wav_ASR	he's been struck by lightning
71-1_2597.575_1.165.wav_ASR	she's the one i wanna be
71-1_2598.975_1.165.wav_ASR	and he heads over to her
71-1_2600.475_2.06.wav_ASR	and there's an invitation
71-1_2604.46_2.0.wav_ASR	he dances with her the inside night
71-1_2606.82_5.16.wav_ASR	he's very clear that maybe at this point in the world if i get to be with this one
71-1_2613.19_4.0.wav_ASR	and he's all of a sudden at this point she's pulling away
71-1_2617.56_0.34.wav_ASR	and she says
71-1_2618.12_0.46.wav_ASR	oh i got to
71-1_2618.76_0.34.wav_ASR	and he's saying
71-1_2619.22_1.32.wav_ASR	you know stick around
71-1_2620.94_0.6.wav_ASR	we got food
71-1_2622.58_0.6.wav_ASR	let's see
71-1_2624.18_1.12.wav_ASR	and she says
71-1_2625.6_0.71.wav_ASR	oh i gotta get back
71-1_2626.5_0.52.wav_ASR	we gotta go
71-1_2627.3_5.8.wav_ASR	and she runs away at about two thirty minutes to midnight because her she says
71-1_2633.26_1.166.wav_ASR	oh i've got this curse
71-1_2634.56_0.786.wav_ASR	and i got away
71-1_2635.38_1.167.wav_ASR	and she raises away
71-1_2637.7_2.81.wav_ASR	and all of a sudden she's a really fast
71-1_2640.94_0.44.wav_ASR	so she's all
71-1_2641.38_4.57.wav_ASR	the way all of a sudden he sees that one of her shoes has been there
71-1_2646.16_0.98.wav_ASR	the glass slipper
71-1_2647.86_2.174.wav_ASR	and so he picks that up
71-1_2650.2_3.24.wav_ASR	that's all he's got of her is this glass slipper
71-1_2654.1_2.56.wav_ASR	so he he goes back to his father and says
71-1_2657.28_1.28.wav_ASR	hey i'll marry somebody
71-1_2658.86_1.868.wav_ASR	there's only one woman i wanna marry
71-1_2660.728_1.516.wav_ASR	and she's the one i want to marry
71-1_2662.968_4.68.wav_ASR	and all i have is this clue that her foot will fit into this shoe
71-1_2668.928_2.54.wav_ASR	but it started aggravitating around the kingdom
71-1_2672.608_7.36.wav_ASR	one that could fit into these slippers the prince will assume you was a conisseur
71-1_2680.85_7.16.wav_ASR	so oh my god all the stepsisters who you know they were aware at the ball
71-1_2688.27_2.82.wav_ASR	but they pretty sure they get their feet into this slipper
71-1_2692.05_1.6.wav_ASR	he went to the container
71-1_2694.54_19.21.wav_ASR	so of course at this point cinderella is back doing her work taking care of the machines cleaning in the kitchen once again just disturbing her entire family
71-1_2714.59_1.81.wav_ASR	so the prince is driving around
71-1_2716.91_4.25.wav_ASR	and it's this really bizarre sort of thing that he's driving around
71-1_2721.43_10.724.wav_ASR	people are running outta their shoes and seeing if their feet will fit into this slipper which is apparently designed specifically to fit this one single woman
71-1_2733.67_1.9.wav_ASR	and he hands up and he stops at their house
71-1_2735.77_6.34.wav_ASR	he's really scared of this point because he hasn't gotten into the woman whose feet will fit into that slipper
71-1_2743.01_1.095.wav_ASR	he sops at this house
71-1_2744.37_2.793.wav_ASR	all of the stepsisters do everything they can
71-1_2747.29_3.08.wav_ASR	but they're food or too big or too long or
71-1_2750.71_0.798.wav_ASR	it's not working
71-1_2751.632_3.22.wav_ASR	and then all of a sudden
71-1_2755.261_2.278.wav_ASR	he's just about ready to leave
71-1_2757.592_1.74.wav_ASR	and all of a sudden he sees a movie
71-1_2760.172_5.59.wav_ASR	and he sees this other woman like the maid who's just in the corner
71-1_2766.572_0.428.wav_ASR	and he says
71-1_2767.252_0.588.wav_ASR	and i don't hear her
71-1_2768.83_1.36.wav_ASR	and the stepmother says
71-1_2770.312_0.798.wav_ASR	and she's no
71-1_2771.5_0.97.wav_ASR	and she's our maid
71-1_2773.43_1.84.wav_ASR	and she looks up
71-1_2775.92_5.43.wav_ASR	he the prince just has this strange feeling about her
71-1_2781.92_1.44.wav_ASR	and i like to have her come out
71-1_2783.78_7.311.wav_ASR	and i'd like to see if this her feet will fit her feet
71-1_2791.091_2.035.wav_ASR	and so she comes out
71-1_2793.371_0.92.wav_ASR	and she's a mess
71-1_2794.711_3.639.wav_ASR	you know she's been working in the kitchen and in the ball
71-1_2798.931_6.2.wav_ASR	and she's you know not not looking anywhere like the prince person that had been at the ball
71-1_2805.87_0.8.wav_ASR	but she came out
71-1_2806.831_0.759.wav_ASR	and she sat down
71-1_2808.51_3.56.wav_ASR	the prince put the slipper on her foot
71-1_2812.99_1.08.wav_ASR	and it fit
71-1_2814.73_0.98.wav_ASR	and then he looked at her
71-1_2815.71_22.48.wav_ASR	and what was realized as that he was able to look behind all of the carriage of the world that she had shown the first time he met her to see that it was exactly the same person even if she was unclear
71-1_2839.43_15.337.wav_ASR	so they happily they lived happily after until just like prince harry some how the porsche did not like the cinderella because she was not of high stature
71-1_2854.767_18.19.wav_ASR	and he hadta rescue his crown and go to another conference and yeah and start right about his future plans about his future to make decisions about his selection to make money
71-1_2872.957_0.84.wav_ASR	alright
71-1_2874.864_1.272.wav_ASR	oh yeah yeah
71-1_2900.37_0.5.wav_ASR	okay
71-1_2905.61_1.0.wav_ASR	oh okay
71-1_2910.67_11.58.wav_ASR	the interesting really irritating thing about clocks to me recently is that i went to a physical check
71-1_2923.03_2.831.wav_ASR	and i just turned sixteen five
71-1_2926.39_2.52.wav_ASR	so i had never experienced this before
71-1_2929.05_5.28.wav_ASR	but i thought it was my annual physical
71-1_2935.52_1.03.wav_ASR	and i walked around
71-1_2936.75_0.57.wav_ASR	and i sat down
71-1_2937.65_2.34.wav_ASR	and the nurse is checking my blood pressure
71-1_2940.41_4.62.wav_ASR	and she's checking you know the my heart rate and all the other stuff
71-1_2945.73_3.06.wav_ASR	and then she handled me a piece of paper and a pen and says
71-1_2948.98_1.34.wav_ASR	how i like to draw a clock
71-1_2951.06_1.01.wav_ASR	and i said
71-1_2953.58_0.57.wav_ASR	and she says
71-1_2954.34_3.38.wav_ASR	because i want to see what kind of picture you you can drive
71-1_2958.32_2.76.wav_ASR	so it seemed difficult
71-1_2961.62_1.027.wav_ASR	yeah i did it anyway
71-1_2963.0_0.93.wav_ASR	and i says
71-1_2964.52_9.32.wav_ASR	and i knew how to handle a picture appropriate with a clock which is first you put down the twelve
71-1_2974.0_0.89.wav_ASR	and then you put down the seed
71-1_2975.14_0.66.wav_ASR	and you put the towel
71-1_2975.98_0.71.wav_ASR	they put the knob
71-1_2976.74_8.82.wav_ASR	and then you fill the number so that everything is labeled where it should be in such a you know having them too crowded
71-1_2986.12_3.09.wav_ASR	and then i hadta draw the pictures of two forty five
71-1_2990.32_1.08.wav_ASR	and i finished
71-1_2991.6_0.4.wav_ASR	and i says
71-1_2992.42_1.46.wav_ASR	oh is this what you want
71-1_2994.75_4.17.wav_ASR	or did you want to just look at what you have on the wall that's right there which is a
71-1_2999.82_0.95.wav_ASR	and she says
71-1_3001.11_2.02.wav_ASR	you have passed this test
71-1_3003.49_0.32.wav_ASR	and she says
71-1_3004.28_1.87.wav_ASR	it was essentially a destination test
71-1_3006.254_13.939.wav_ASR	that when you're sixteen five and you go into for an annual check you will hafta see a apartment for an annual check you will hafta draw a clock
71-1_3020.834_0.477.wav_ASR	and i says
71-1_3021.514_2.193.wav_ASR	what point will they stop doing this
71-1_3023.76_9.43.wav_ASR	while while i did indeed grow grow up with the you know the round sock right you useta dig
71-1_3033.8_1.68.wav_ASR	everything i do is chicken
71-1_3035.807_16.95.wav_ASR	so what happens at what jurisdictions at what you do that this is not the way to show that this is not the day to show that you do not have dementia understanding of of what time is
71-1_3053.5_2.36.wav_ASR	oh anyway if i do it again i'm not gonna do it again
71-1_3056.16_6.11.wav_ASR	and i'll just gonna maybe just mess with them and just put down some digital stuff and see what they do
71-1_3062.88_3.78.wav_ASR	and you have my p t or something like boop welchick
71-1_3066.9_2.818.wav_ASR	but anyway it's it's a test that they do
71-1_3069.718_3.888.wav_ASR	and i found it really irritating though i passed
71-1_3074.018_3.915.wav_ASR	but it's it's gonna be ultimate very quickly
71-1_3078.438_1.048.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
71-1_3084.638_1.963.wav_ASR	let me see
71-1_3091.487_18.88.wav_ASR	one of the things i useta do when my daughter was younger is every january usually the first week in january we would head together to watch the egg watch
71-1_3110.83_14.71.wav_ASR	and what the ego watch was is north of here the buses are is one place that in the suburbs there's one place
71-1_3125.67_0.72.wav_ASR	they're coming back
71-1_3126.63_1.247.wav_ASR	they're going south or something
71-1_3127.877_5.666.wav_ASR	but they all show up in this lake for about three or four days
71-1_3134.157_8.44.wav_ASR	and so what people do is they have groups the auditors separate and other groups that show up with them
71-1_3144.23_4.65.wav_ASR	and we watched the the eggs because you could see them
71-1_3149.19_1.113.wav_ASR	yeah really really close
71-1_3150.45_1.46.wav_ASR	you can see the eggs
71-1_3152.49_1.454.wav_ASR	and you could see them with their mother
71-1_3154.33_2.28.wav_ASR	and there was just so many of them at one time
71-1_3157.17_2.038.wav_ASR	it sposta we have a hunt
71-1_3159.43_4.8.wav_ASR	but we don't necessarily see ball eggs as much
71-1_3164.36_1.23.wav_ASR	it's it's much more rare
71-1_3166.48_4.788.wav_ASR	that's something that we did for a number of years
71-1_3171.36_2.94.wav_ASR	even when she was thirteen and wasn't really talking to anybody
71-1_3174.98_2.763.wav_ASR	we always had fun on that day
71-1_3177.96_0.725.wav_ASR	we would show you
71-1_3179.02_3.122.wav_ASR	and first she dressed really warm because it's gonna be twenty below
71-1_3182.59_3.58.wav_ASR	we would go to the bank with bank
71-1_3186.63_2.08.wav_ASR	we would wait for the egg to sprout
71-1_3188.91_1.44.wav_ASR	we would watch them for life
71-1_3190.65_2.38.wav_ASR	and then we would go have coffee
71-1_3193.31_2.86.wav_ASR	and she all talking at that time
71-1_3196.61_2.19.wav_ASR	when we were home then it was
71-1_3199.11_0.88.wav_ASR	oh god she's my mom
71-1_3200.21_0.568.wav_ASR	and i'm tall
71-1_3200.778_1.896.wav_ASR	don't know if i can talk to my friends
71-1_3202.738_13.726.wav_ASR	but there was always that one period even in those very very late years that my doctors always talked to me after we watched the eggs
71-1_3216.464_5.16.wav_ASR	so that's one of the things that i would think of when i think of the word bird
71-1_3227.38_1.01.wav_ASR	what what was the word again
71-1_3230.244_2.56.wav_ASR	oh i don't know if you wanna hear that story
71-1_3233.039_0.485.wav_ASR	and he says
71-1_3233.991_2.78.wav_ASR	well i okay
71-1_3236.777_13.094.wav_ASR	and i can't do you a recent one that will clearly not be watered or anything like that could be way more interesting
71-1_3250.021_10.775.wav_ASR	and i will talk about something i did last summer just in since my stroke i've been trying to push myself a little bit
71-1_3260.881_2.569.wav_ASR	and again i'm i'm much more tired than i used to be
71-1_3263.61_5.251.wav_ASR	but i'm still trying to push my boundaries to find out exactly what's possible
71-1_3268.93_1.28.wav_ASR	how how much can i do
71-1_3270.29_1.827.wav_ASR	and how long can i drive
71-1_3272.13_3.6.wav_ASR	and how many hours a day can i you know be active
71-1_3275.741_2.789.wav_ASR	and so i worked with this prompt prompt
71-1_3279.53_5.7.wav_ASR	and we were having an event in northern wisconsin off the american route
71-1_3285.397_2.48.wav_ASR	and it's our group is called wags
71-1_3289.337_1.68.wav_ASR	we do with m r my duties
71-1_3291.677_3.779.wav_ASR	so i i head up this wall as soon as possible
71-1_3295.737_1.06.wav_ASR	and i hadta get up
71-1_3296.957_5.26.wav_ASR	thank i left town at five to get up there by eight
71-1_3302.331_5.519.wav_ASR	we had events all day long and talking and you know different things going on
71-1_3307.891_1.32.wav_ASR	and it was really really hot
71-1_3310.051_3.538.wav_ASR	and i was ready to drive home by five o'clock
71-1_3314.151_2.269.wav_ASR	and about an hour on the way
71-1_3317.011_2.559.wav_ASR	that's about three hundred hour therapy
71-1_3319.71_2.98.wav_ASR	but decided i can't drive anymore to
71-1_3323.47_1.68.wav_ASR	my head was just
71-1_3326.15_3.68.wav_ASR	and i needed to sleep really quickly
71-1_3329.87_2.42.wav_ASR	and i've learned to listen to myself
71-1_3332.61_4.86.wav_ASR	my body says you'll pull over and you reset
71-1_3337.649_5.112.wav_ASR	you don't just talk wrong through drunk some coffee and keep on going
71-1_3343.27_1.34.wav_ASR	so i pulled into this hotel
71-1_3345.85_1.66.wav_ASR	it if i found him
71-1_3347.849_3.041.wav_ASR	you know i didn't have a respiratory rescue or anything
71-1_3351.11_9.614.wav_ASR	and i was just looking for a place that had an opening so i could go in and get out of the sun and you know cover my eyes and not hafta drive anymore
71-1_3360.85_10.96.wav_ASR	but because i was as tired as i was and because i was poor as my aphasia had clearly blurred
71-1_3372.95_2.18.wav_ASR	so i walked in this hotel
71-1_3375.69_3.36.wav_ASR	and there were lots of vacation
71-1_3379.64_2.57.wav_ASR	well actually i didn't know that right away
71-1_3382.66_1.98.wav_ASR	but i thought it said vacation
71-1_3385.14_0.809.wav_ASR	but i wasn't sure
71-1_3386.18_0.937.wav_ASR	but i walked in the door
71-1_3388.0_2.42.wav_ASR	and there's this woman behind the the desk
71-1_3390.82_0.48.wav_ASR	and i says
71-1_3391.54_2.24.wav_ASR	you know i'm here for a room
71-1_3394.62_0.32.wav_ASR	and i says
71-1_3395.02_1.08.wav_ASR	do you have any vacation
71-1_3397.62_5.68.wav_ASR	and and of course that's what happens with aphasia as you say words
71-1_3403.92_3.86.wav_ASR	and no accidents could have been caused to cause it
71-1_3408.16_3.161.wav_ASR	and people are wearing masks
71-1_3411.64_1.783.wav_ASR	and they're being very careful about that
71-1_3413.72_2.58.wav_ASR	so of course i was trying to say
71-1_3416.34_1.56.wav_ASR	and you have a sandwich
71-1_3418.62_1.778.wav_ASR	you met him
71-1_3420.7_1.02.wav_ASR	you have a vacation
71-1_3422.16_3.26.wav_ASR	and so went into her computer program
71-1_3426.26_1.62.wav_ASR	yeah everybody here's been back in
71-1_3428.38_0.711.wav_ASR	we all were mad
71-1_3429.38_0.988.wav_ASR	wait everything down
71-1_3430.72_0.54.wav_ASR	and i'm saying
71-1_3431.88_0.98.wav_ASR	so you have a ride
71-1_3433.14_0.664.wav_ASR	and she says
71-1_3433.92_1.033.wav_ASR	yeah yeah yeah
71-1_3435.16_0.545.wav_ASR	don't worry
71-1_3435.705_1.0.wav_ASR	but we followed coach
71-1_3436.845_0.623.wav_ASR	and don't worry about it
71-1_3437.565_1.797.wav_ASR	you're not gonna get it here
71-1_3439.805_1.863.wav_ASR	and she gave me a room
71-1_3441.825_6.66.wav_ASR	that was one way to cover things up is you just go with it you know
71-1_3448.76_1.911.wav_ASR	so i wanted she had a vacation
71-1_3451.44_0.31.wav_ASR	and i says
71-1_3452.165_0.98.wav_ASR	you have a back
71-1_3453.98_1.77.wav_ASR	and so we just went with backpacks
71-1_3456.24_2.03.wav_ASR	and then finally i went back to
71-1_3459.14_2.56.wav_ASR	you have an extra room that i can sleep in
71-1_3462.68_5.02.wav_ASR	so i got in droop went in droppings a lot of cold water and little suckers
71-1_3468.94_0.48.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
71-1_3471.54_2.08.wav_ASR	so that's another story
71-1_3478.5_0.5.wav_ASR	and yeah
71-1_3480.14_0.8.wav_ASR	and yeah
71-1_3481.62_20.94.wav_ASR	oh i guess if i was going to choose something to talk about how i paid my way through my account i would talk about how i paid my credit card which is through
71-1_3504.63_14.68.wav_ASR	and i waited beginning at at kind of a little coffee shop that was near where i lived because i had no car
71-1_3520.12_1.31.wav_ASR	and i could just bite there
71-1_3522.42_1.45.wav_ASR	and they were very very kind
71-1_3524.03_2.94.wav_ASR	and i did the background speech
71-1_3528.1_14.32.wav_ASR	but i learned very quickly after about six months that you would get paid ten to fifteen percent as a tip based on the prices of the restaurants
71-1_3543.14_8.24.wav_ASR	so what made sense was to find the restaurant that was the most extensive in terms of prices and where there
71-1_3552.167_3.873.wav_ASR	doing the exact same same part of service
71-1_3556.39_19.218.wav_ASR	if they're only paying five dollars for their meal and their handed you fifty cents that's not gonna be near as good as they spent twenty dollars for it
71-1_3575.98_5.36.wav_ASR	so what i learned to do is keep going to more and more expect a response
71-1_3582.46_20.82.wav_ASR	the the the maybe untold story is the wasters that work in the the the greedy spoops are just as good as not bad in the really high price you know high price
71-1_3604.84_2.74.wav_ASR	so that's where i ended up doing
71-1_3608.2_4.664.wav_ASR	and but again it was so interesting to me as that i worked just as hard
71-1_3613.32_4.157.wav_ASR	and i used the same sort of you know
71-1_3618.84_5.61.wav_ASR	you hafta keep a recall list of tasks that you in the middle of doing
71-1_3624.45_1.994.wav_ASR	whether you're going to the bar to get drunk
71-1_3626.65_1.508.wav_ASR	are you going here to get your foot
71-1_3628.39_1.405.wav_ASR	you're gonna go people more water
71-1_3630.11_0.946.wav_ASR	you're gonna give me your check
71-1_3631.51_5.578.wav_ASR	you hafta keep them all kind of rolling all at one time
71-1_3637.31_4.757.wav_ASR	trying to decide exactly how you're going to prioritize each of those tasks
71-1_3642.067_10.0.wav_ASR	it's really i mean being waiting being a waiter is a really meaningful challenge challenging you
71-1_3653.687_3.66.wav_ASR	it's just bizarre that they don't pay people anymore to do that
71-1_3657.49_4.33.wav_ASR	but i was lucky because i made enough money that i was still able to graduate
71-1_3662.01_8.22.wav_ASR	and i wasn't paying the degree of the amount of money that graduated now which is out
71-1_3672.05_0.61.wav_ASR	and she says
71-1_3673.93_2.38.wav_ASR	so yeah it's for my understanding
71-1_3676.61_1.701.wav_ASR	gradually school that was very difficult
71-1_3678.311_5.3.wav_ASR	but yeah i had no stitches because i worked as a surgeon in russia
71-1_3698.06_0.59.wav_ASR	yeah you know
71-1_3699.03_2.999.wav_ASR	and it's it is really manageable kind of like
71-1_3703.14_1.235.wav_ASR	we got you know three minutes
71-1_3704.68_0.709.wav_ASR	but i can go get that
71-1_3705.62_0.591.wav_ASR	and i go everywhere
71-1_3706.54_0.366.wav_ASR	and okay
71-1_3707.62_2.536.wav_ASR	it's kind of like it's kind of a challenge
71-1_3710.2_0.816.wav_ASR	that's kind of fun
71-1_3713.34_0.455.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
71-1_3718.76_0.845.wav_ASR	and you can kinda see it
71-1_3719.76_0.59.wav_ASR	and they need water
71-1_3720.7_1.28.wav_ASR	and you need more coffee over there
71-1_3722.26_0.96.wav_ASR	and you got this going on
71-1_3723.52_4.32.wav_ASR	and i will say that the second place i worked at tried to try
71-1_3728.62_8.414.wav_ASR	and when i went to get a physical they were trying to figure out why this month on this one
71-1_3738.16_0.74.wav_ASR	they're something going on
71-1_3739.09_0.75.wav_ASR	they're in growth
71-1_3739.97_0.49.wav_ASR	and i says
71-1_3740.68_1.82.wav_ASR	and i'm just feeling really stressed
71-1_3743.1_1.92.wav_ASR	yeah yeah so yeah
71-1_3753.971_14.825.wav_ASR	well if i were going to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich i would begin by folding the bread
71-1_3769.311_2.802.wav_ASR	and taking out two slices of bread
71-1_3772.113_2.019.wav_ASR	and laying them on the table
71-1_3774.633_8.24.wav_ASR	then i would go and get the jar of jelly and the jar of peanut butter
71-1_3783.713_4.173.wav_ASR	and i would bring probably a spoon and a knife with me
71-1_3788.57_2.863.wav_ASR	we would begin with the peanut butter peanut butter
71-1_3792.068_2.272.wav_ASR	it's really difficult to say isn't it
71-1_3794.488_0.84.wav_ASR	peanut butter
71-1_3796.268_4.045.wav_ASR	and i would spread that on one side of the bread
71-1_3800.828_3.96.wav_ASR	the other piece of bread i would put on
71-1_3805.108_1.06.wav_ASR	we use a spoon
71-1_3806.568_1.011.wav_ASR	and i would pull out the jacket
71-1_3807.92_4.373.wav_ASR	and i would spread that evenly on that piece of bread
71-1_3812.7_2.72.wav_ASR	then i would close the tube of them together
71-1_3816.12_6.32.wav_ASR	we would close the tops back on the jelly and the peanut butter
71-1_3822.66_0.63.wav_ASR	put them away
71-1_3823.88_1.4.wav_ASR	and then i would eat my sandwich
71-1_3832.11_5.6.wav_ASR	well i don't do it often
71-1_3838.45_1.708.wav_ASR	you're not so nice to me
71-1_3840.85_15.069.wav_ASR	when when i do my laundry distinct from i do have washing machine downstairs i tend to go to the laundry mat because i can do all of it one time
71-1_3856.37_2.654.wav_ASR	and i only wanna do it once a week or every other week
71-1_3859.024_4.476.wav_ASR	because it's just something i find kind of boring to do
71-1_3863.904_3.04.wav_ASR	what i do is
71-1_3868.044_1.74.wav_ASR	how i hafta do this today
71-1_3870.184_1.23.wav_ASR	so let me think about this
71-1_3871.644_3.54.wav_ASR	and all of my dirty clothes
71-1_3875.33_5.584.wav_ASR	and usually use the smell test to find out whether they go into the hamper or not
71-1_3880.914_18.7.wav_ASR	and when i decide that everything needs to be washed which also will include the towels the wash clothes and the other tubs hands that are hanging up in the kitchen i would all of them in
71-1_3900.01_5.52.wav_ASR	and i would use a container of laundry detergent
71-1_3907.24_0.66.wav_ASR	yeah i would put them
71-1_3908.31_4.39.wav_ASR	we would carry it to the back side of my the back of my car
71-1_3913.6_8.52.wav_ASR	we would make sure i had quarters or had cash that i could use for the quarter machine in the laundry room
71-1_3923.11_1.57.wav_ASR	and i would go into the laundry machine
71-1_3924.88_6.327.wav_ASR	and i would find the largest meal that i could do all of my laundry at one time in one machine
71-1_3931.207_5.18.wav_ASR	and i would put the laundry in
71-1_3937.23_12.357.wav_ASR	if they didn't all fit i would make sure that the clothing that could be washed at a higher temperature wash me
71-1_3950.36_1.814.wav_ASR	and make sure the soup was in
71-1_3952.46_2.068.wav_ASR	and i would make sure i had enough coffee
71-1_3955.36_6.792.wav_ASR	and then i would probably go by food or something they're being washed
71-1_3962.36_0.924.wav_ASR	come back
71-1_3963.54_1.44.wav_ASR	they in the dryer
71-1_3965.86_2.403.wav_ASR	and i don't really fold them the way i'm supposed to
71-1_3968.54_0.71.wav_ASR	yeah i just can't
71-1_3969.66_4.29.wav_ASR	and then put them away kind of as i use them when i
71-1_3985.92_4.75.wav_ASR	you mean what i choose to wear or
71-1_3995.3_0.57.wav_ASR	oh i see
71-1_3996.39_11.38.wav_ASR	well the first thing i would do every morning is start my coffee because that really is gonna hafta happen before i make decisions about what matters
71-1_4008.33_2.38.wav_ASR	and i would stop by the side
71-1_4011.9_2.75.wav_ASR	and i usually do the pour over
71-1_4015.51_1.41.wav_ASR	and i really didn't care
71-1_4017.61_2.19.wav_ASR	so i usually would grind the clock
71-1_4020.33_1.78.wav_ASR	the water the water
71-1_4023.83_2.36.wav_ASR	and i would go into my bed
71-1_4026.63_3.12.wav_ASR	and generally i have some idea of what i'm gonna do
71-1_4030.63_3.28.wav_ASR	if only because i hafta dig stuff out sometimes
71-1_4033.91_1.26.wav_ASR	and i don't wanna have anything
71-1_4035.602_4.45.wav_ASR	but i don't really have time to look a lot in the morning
71-1_4040.49_2.54.wav_ASR	so i coulda paid a fee of what i'm gonna wear already
71-1_4043.51_5.14.wav_ASR	so i usually start well clear
71-1_4049.59_3.481.wav_ASR	and then whatever path or script i'm wearing
71-1_4053.071_3.66.wav_ASR	and at that point the water is usually really wet
71-1_4057.231_2.079.wav_ASR	so yeah i got my lines cleared
71-1_4059.631_10.319.wav_ASR	so i'm you know running around here halfway shot my coffee and then figuring out what kinda shirt i'm gonna wear tomorrow and then trying to make decisions about how cold it is
71-1_4070.191_1.359.wav_ASR	so i needed wear my hip strap
71-1_4071.75_1.32.wav_ASR	do i need to wear a light one
71-1_4073.07_2.819.wav_ASR	well the clock is being made
71-1_4076.37_2.828.wav_ASR	but the top of my body's made all my base clothes on
71-1_4079.87_6.666.wav_ASR	and then i take the coffee with me in the bathroom when i make decisions about ears and hair and all that other stuff
71-1_4086.94_4.822.wav_ASR	but yeah the basic is all specifications the night before so i hafta wear about it
71-1_4091.79_5.715.wav_ASR	and if i accidentally am tired and don't know what i'm doing i just wear back because it matches everywhere
71-1_4098.11_1.432.wav_ASR	so i had a lot of blood clots
71-1_4100.07_0.77.wav_ASR	oh there's something
71-2_14.77_15.16.wav_ASR	and i think my favorite card about where i live and i live on the near east side of madison is that's on the lake
71-2_30.89_1.34.wav_ASR	the castle is a city
71-2_32.41_2.38.wav_ASR	we we have four different lakes that are here
71-2_35.21_8.54.wav_ASR	and the medication actually comes from a word from hook up that actually suggests me to leave
71-2_44.69_5.4.wav_ASR	so a block away from where i live is lake
71-2_50.725_3.302.wav_ASR	and it's the biggest of the lake
71-2_54.665_6.7.wav_ASR	and what i like the most about it is there's a bike to my
71-2_62.83_6.42.wav_ASR	the lake is to my left with a running path that goes along it
71-2_70.27_7.38.wav_ASR	and i literally can get pretty much everywhere that i needta go in the city of madison without having to drive
71-2_79.43_1.82.wav_ASR	and i'm very close to the lake
71-2_82.17_4.02.wav_ASR	so one of the things i do when i run
71-2_86.95_2.98.wav_ASR	so now i would pretty much call it fast walking
71-2_90.071_3.86.wav_ASR	and not not not from my
71-2_94.531_6.34.wav_ASR	in my time i would run about seven or eight miles an hour
71-2_100.931_2.26.wav_ASR	and i would get it down through about seven minutes
71-2_103.351_3.4.wav_ASR	and i'm pretty much just walking and yeah
71-2_107.621_3.7.wav_ASR	and we're more like eleven minutes miles
71-2_111.741_2.56.wav_ASR	but i usually get about five in every morning
71-2_114.621_7.309.wav_ASR	it's it's kind of material in the sense that you can look at the water
71-2_122.181_1.029.wav_ASR	you could see the bird
71-2_123.87_10.3.wav_ASR	it's just much more saturday that would be to be in a triage
71-2_134.77_3.32.wav_ASR	so that's one of the things i really like about where i live
71-2_139.91_1.36.wav_ASR	tree tree
71-2_142.244_0.5.wav_ASR	and yeah
71-2_144.217_0.467.wav_ASR	okay
71-2_144.93_1.073.wav_ASR	yeah i don't think that i'm
71-2_146.764_2.154.wav_ASR	and not sure that's the right word that i need
71-2_149.284_0.5.wav_ASR	and i mean
71-2_153.748_0.593.wav_ASR	you know what is it
71-2_155.384_1.306.wav_ASR	yeah i'd see the word
71-2_156.884_0.526.wav_ASR	but i kept saying
71-2_157.764_1.566.wav_ASR	oh i'm screaming that word at himself
71-2_159.584_0.92.wav_ASR	but now i wasn't
71-2_160.706_2.562.wav_ASR	what's i hear a word that i already know
71-2_163.426_0.544.wav_ASR	and i keep saying
71-2_164.206_1.044.wav_ASR	that i'm saying that i'm saying that wrong
71-2_165.746_4.624.wav_ASR	but i just hafta be excited with words that i actually already know
71-2_171.106_0.564.wav_ASR	so yeah
71-2_173.086_3.54.wav_ASR	you're long the lake is much better than being on a treadmill
71-2_177.146_2.769.wav_ASR	and i'll the clock away which is why i'm living here
71-2_179.915_0.5.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
71-2_200.31_2.58.wav_ASR	again my speech is not right
71-2_204.23_8.987.wav_ASR	for the most part when i speak i no what i'm going to say
71-2_213.77_16.481.wav_ASR	but if i try to say something that is more comprehensive something in more date or come out the way i'd like to say them
71-2_230.251_8.589.wav_ASR	or the words are in my brain but i'm not quite able to articulate them the way that i want to
71-2_238.97_3.38.wav_ASR	generally i know right away when i've made a mistake
71-2_243.091_1.339.wav_ASR	but sometimes i don't
71-2_244.631_2.0.wav_ASR	he yesterday i said to someone
71-2_246.696_3.48.wav_ASR	well we got this exact coming up in january fourth
71-2_250.676_1.27.wav_ASR	and she says
71-2_253.536_0.404.wav_ASR	alright for me
71-2_253.94_0.621.wav_ASR	but it's apple
71-2_254.576_0.84.wav_ASR	and i says
71-2_255.492_0.747.wav_ASR	what did i say
71-2_256.376_0.528.wav_ASR	and she says
71-2_256.996_0.815.wav_ASR	you said firstnamej
71-2_258.98_1.021.wav_ASR	well it felt like firstnamej
71-2_260.696_3.525.wav_ASR	again i tried to just wind those and figure out where to get past it
71-2_264.41_8.22.wav_ASR	but i simply cannot trust that what will come out of my mouth is what i'm actually trying to say
71-2_273.01_14.82.wav_ASR	and i don't know how to fix that except just to keep trying to restore those language paths that have been disrupted and try to catch them fast i guess
71-2_295.73_2.62.wav_ASR	yes i remember exactly when i had a stroke
71-2_298.52_5.42.wav_ASR	and i had a stroke on january first twenty twenty
71-2_320.33_14.302.wav_ASR	so i essentially had a hemorrhagic clot headache to my right temporal stroke and did not know what it was for two days
71-2_335.13_1.573.wav_ASR	and then of course they admitted me
71-2_336.703_9.4.wav_ASR	but it was past the window of opportunity to give me some type of duck that might barking up the clock
71-2_347.563_2.227.wav_ASR	so i addressed the hospital
71-2_350.403_1.92.wav_ASR	they assumed i would have another stroke
71-2_353.183_0.607.wav_ASR	and i have none
71-2_354.09_4.36.wav_ASR	and they have not been able to find the cause of the illness
71-2_359.72_1.67.wav_ASR	my son it was the perfect storm
71-2_362.04_12.44.wav_ASR	and i assume it might've been a concussion of working out really hard being stressed because of the pandemic and not being able to have christmas
71-2_374.76_2.765.wav_ASR	those were pre accident day
71-2_378.52_3.0.wav_ASR	we were in a position that where it was pretty exercise
71-2_381.743_3.632.wav_ASR	and i don't know what else it could have been
71-2_385.583_5.67.wav_ASR	little there's there's physically nothing wrong with my body
71-2_391.703_3.994.wav_ASR	and all of my numbers indicate that i should not have a stroke
71-2_395.843_2.223.wav_ASR	and yes yes i had a stroke
71-2_398.363_1.62.wav_ASR	so yeah anything
71-2_400.181_2.92.wav_ASR	tripod tripod
71-2_403.981_4.263.wav_ASR	you just move on with that i guess
71-2_408.721_0.379.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
71-2_418.32_17.68.wav_ASR	well as i sat a week ago most of the recovery has been selfinitiated and has not been done through the documentation of therapy or help from many medical professionals
71-2_437.57_8.66.wav_ASR	and i think that's kind of a travesty in the sense that people with that had
71-2_446.73_3.68.wav_ASR	but i was carried as having a mild severe stroke
71-2_451.57_12.92.wav_ASR	we are in the position of the potential to come to complete recover if we're given the right information in the right context
71-2_464.99_16.04.wav_ASR	so i think the first six months after stroke is really cruel in terms of retrograde recovery because you're building on your brain as a result to bring back language
71-2_482.13_11.14.wav_ASR	and i'm really disappointed in the america helped insurance insurance in the accident that i should've gotten
71-2_493.53_18.08.wav_ASR	and so what i've done on my own is really increase my the quality of my diet which was already measured mediterranean medication medication therapy
71-2_511.89_1.417.wav_ASR	how ever expected that
71-2_513.307_1.654.wav_ASR	and i've been doing that about ten years
71-2_515.327_10.103.wav_ASR	and i gave up drinking completely though i didn't really think that was an issue since i was drunk once a month
71-2_525.43_10.02.wav_ASR	but it might increase to it might increase
71-2_536.21_4.1.wav_ASR	it might increase inflammation in my body
71-2_540.325_10.3.wav_ASR	and that's something that i tried to work very strongly to make sure that i have an int int intravenous medication
71-2_551.465_1.7.wav_ASR	how i interacted with them
71-2_553.585_1.6.wav_ASR	again i've already taken it
71-2_559.81_19.778.wav_ASR	so i i increase the cognitive my cognitive tests that i do every second day to make sure that my focus and concentration levels are relatively high
71-2_579.588_2.895.wav_ASR	again i was naccrophobic
71-2_582.748_15.385.wav_ASR	so i have already always done a lot of writing every day doing a lot of writing every day do a lot of close work every day trying to develop and weave everything together every single day
71-2_598.133_2.617.wav_ASR	and i've done it much more consistently than in the past
71-2_601.85_7.16.wav_ASR	writing is always reliable in the sense that i have the option of edit
71-2_609.473_2.297.wav_ASR	and i do sometimes use the wrong word
71-2_612.753_2.617.wav_ASR	but i you hardly catch it when i at it
71-2_615.79_3.34.wav_ASR	and i always hadta eat it before the stroke too
71-2_619.37_9.39.wav_ASR	so i don't know to what extent those states are connected to the stroke office or whether that's just the way that i write it
71-2_628.91_4.36.wav_ASR	and sometimes you do a rough draft to get the ideas out
71-2_633.443_2.915.wav_ASR	and then you remind it the second time around
71-2_637.303_9.727.wav_ASR	so i i i think the only real difference from the way in which before is making my life after the stroke then before is making sure that i always get up
71-2_647.963_4.187.wav_ASR	before the stroke i tried to get sleep
71-2_652.45_7.12.wav_ASR	but if i didn't i just poured on because i have a schedule that i hafta follow
71-2_660.87_8.901.wav_ASR	now it's it's a priority for me to the extent that i have a ability to make sure that i sleep as much as i can
71-2_670.05_5.06.wav_ASR	but after that i just have a rhythm every single day that i always do
71-2_676.49_0.563.wav_ASR	they're really wild
71-2_677.41_1.165.wav_ASR	exactly every day
71-2_679.05_2.72.wav_ASR	push my brain as much as i can
71-2_682.23_7.28.wav_ASR	and i made attempt to take back up a language skill
71-2_689.79_3.4.wav_ASR	but i was taking spanish classes before the stroke
71-2_693.397_2.653.wav_ASR	when i took breath when i was in high school
71-2_696.33_3.6.wav_ASR	and i picked up a little bit of denmark when i lived in copenhagen
71-2_701.01_4.263.wav_ASR	but i thought spasticity would be much more useful than fractures
71-2_706.37_2.1.wav_ASR	so i started taking a spanish class
71-2_708.69_4.73.wav_ASR	and i hadta disconnect it because it was late at night
71-2_713.57_1.99.wav_ASR	it just really wasn't working out for me
71-2_716.7_10.19.wav_ASR	but from what i read recently i think one of the things that might be really helpful to realize my english is to pick up a spanker
71-2_727.56_1.88.wav_ASR	it's i you know i don't
71-2_729.6_1.14.wav_ASR	that might it might be confusion
71-2_731.12_2.971.wav_ASR	but why not try it you know
71-2_734.091_1.949.wav_ASR	why not seeing what happened
71-2_736.54_3.066.wav_ASR	so yeah that might be what i do next i think
71-2_739.76_1.333.wav_ASR	what i'm already doing
71-2_767.08_3.158.wav_ASR	let me see
71-2_771.54_4.68.wav_ASR	happy sad
71-2_779.25_0.7.wav_ASR	and yeah
71-2_782.83_5.9.wav_ASR	how i'm gonna talk about my rejection to what happened on nine eleven in two thousand eleven
71-2_790.19_2.46.wav_ASR	and i was tired
71-2_793.11_3.98.wav_ASR	it was the beginning of the the spring semester in two thousand and one
71-2_797.09_4.16.wav_ASR	and my daughter had gone to school
71-2_803.03_9.82.wav_ASR	so as soon she left at about eight fifteen i turned out the computer because i hadta fix my spell
71-2_813.15_3.66.wav_ASR	yeah i should've already finished my sandwich
71-2_817.67_1.9.wav_ASR	and it was generally done
71-2_819.73_2.089.wav_ASR	but i was kinda playing with some of the end of the game
71-2_822.23_5.923.wav_ASR	oh my egyptology class because i just wanted to just up date it a little bit
71-2_828.41_1.08.wav_ASR	so i wasn't alive
71-2_830.33_2.92.wav_ASR	obviously the ravioli was not because i hadta contract
71-2_833.352_4.423.wav_ASR	or i certainly wasn't watching television when i was trying to do my work
71-2_837.872_12.614.wav_ASR	so i was in this shot of silence with no connection to the outside what's going through the different architecture and discovering which one would fit in terms of what i was trying to do
71-2_851.51_5.54.wav_ASR	and at two o'clock in the afternoon i was gonna take a break
71-2_857.21_3.32.wav_ASR	but i was gonna go to my gym and work out
71-2_861.07_1.14.wav_ASR	and it was a beautiful day
71-2_862.61_1.64.wav_ASR	it was you know set timer over there
71-2_868.85_0.8.wav_ASR	and i turned on the radio
71-2_870.87_3.98.wav_ASR	and the accountant said
71-2_875.69_2.16.wav_ASR	and i don't really know if the school is gonna close
71-2_878.53_0.64.wav_ASR	and i'm saying
71-2_879.77_1.12.wav_ASR	the school is gonna close
71-2_881.09_0.48.wav_ASR	excuse me
71-2_888.143_3.145.wav_ASR	and and i got to the gym
71-2_892.33_2.473.wav_ASR	and they were celebrations every year
71-2_895.423_2.206.wav_ASR	they were in the depths when you come in
71-2_897.723_1.36.wav_ASR	and that never ever occurred
71-2_899.443_1.827.wav_ASR	and everybody looked really sad
71-2_901.963_1.96.wav_ASR	so i'm walking in their saying
71-2_904.483_2.874.wav_ASR	thing happened here that i don't know about
71-2_907.37_1.5.wav_ASR	but everybody else knows about them
71-2_909.35_2.12.wav_ASR	and they're all staring at the screen
71-2_911.55_3.34.wav_ASR	so i went to the second where my trip missed
71-2_915.83_3.818.wav_ASR	and again the trails were not anywhere near where it was running along the lake
71-2_919.77_3.262.wav_ASR	but that's what i was gonna do that day because i hadta do some light
71-2_923.27_1.915.wav_ASR	and that's what i saw
71-2_925.185_12.8.wav_ASR	but at that point by two o'clock in the afternoon they were just reeling it over and over again about the twin towers in decaying
71-2_938.265_2.813.wav_ASR	and they were intimidating people who were trying to get away
71-2_941.365_1.64.wav_ASR	and everything is covered with asphalt
71-2_944.49_6.22.wav_ASR	and i remember getting on the the treadmill and you know putting on my headphones and listening to it
71-2_951.07_7.56.wav_ASR	and i just kept going fast and faster and faster and faster because the accident of what happened was just shot
71-2_959.41_3.86.wav_ASR	so i kinda used that you know to increase my work
71-2_963.53_2.82.wav_ASR	and i got out of there
71-2_966.61_1.02.wav_ASR	and i went home and said
71-2_967.91_0.384.wav_ASR	wait a minute
71-2_968.294_4.966.wav_ASR	you got a really close friend that lives in d r that works near the p t
71-2_973.35_2.086.wav_ASR	so is he
71-2_975.69_0.829.wav_ASR	what's going on
71-2_977.21_0.94.wav_ASR	so i tried to call
71-2_978.45_3.78.wav_ASR	and of course i couldn't get through because all the signals were were dead
71-2_982.23_3.06.wav_ASR	and no one could get home in december
71-2_985.57_1.836.wav_ASR	everything was shut down
71-2_988.71_2.16.wav_ASR	and i got on line
71-2_991.09_0.94.wav_ASR	and i started email
71-2_992.31_1.48.wav_ASR	and then i emailed my department
71-2_993.97_1.78.wav_ASR	so i was in the physical side of part two
71-2_995.93_0.34.wav_ASR	and she says
71-2_996.81_2.067.wav_ASR	we're gonna have a panel on campus
71-2_999.41_1.76.wav_ASR	we're gonna invite the community
71-2_1001.32_2.481.wav_ASR	and we're going to explain what is going on
71-2_1004.36_5.934.wav_ASR	and we're we're gonna improve all of that
71-2_1010.3_3.871.wav_ASR	we're gonna expand the capacity of it
71-2_1014.18_3.5.wav_ASR	we're gonna talk about the history of everything
71-2_1018.48_2.588.wav_ASR	we're gonna explain exactly what is going on here
71-2_1021.068_3.442.wav_ASR	and everybody got back to me immediately
71-2_1024.788_2.32.wav_ASR	and they everyone responded and said
71-2_1027.288_1.502.wav_ASR	and i'd be happy to talk about this
71-2_1029.048_5.302.wav_ASR	and i'll be happy to talk about the sentences in a walk that are going on correctly
71-2_1034.35_7.22.wav_ASR	and maybe that's related to what's going on with the the the the bombsters that are
71-2_1041.762_18.784.wav_ASR	all we knew at that point that they were all we knew at that point that they were contacting the united states and the california as a result
71-2_1060.546_2.0.wav_ASR	and how it is that were we
71-2_1063.386_1.58.wav_ASR	they were animals with us
71-2_1066.026_2.694.wav_ASR	oh yeah it all came together
71-2_1069.006_1.514.wav_ASR	they went to beat at one o'clock in the morning
71-2_1071.126_4.007.wav_ASR	finally got email back from my friend firstnamed who was fine
71-2_1075.986_3.141.wav_ASR	and got up went to campus the next day
71-2_1079.127_3.12.wav_ASR	and all the the leftovers were just scrambled
71-2_1082.467_8.34.wav_ASR	and all we did is talk about what happened in every single class hour after hour after hour after hours
71-2_1091.927_2.073.wav_ASR	alright that's that's a lot there
71-2_1094.327_0.6.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
71-2_1095.507_3.195.wav_ASR	it was a great panel by way
71-2_1098.702_2.177.wav_ASR	we think we had five hundred people
71-2_1101.002_4.48.wav_ASR	it standing long standing standing
71-2_1106.562_0.607.wav_ASR	and i tried to say
71-2_1107.262_1.0.wav_ASR	and standing
71-2_1108.642_3.021.wav_ASR	people hadta stand in the back
71-2_1111.942_1.56.wav_ASR	what do i'm trying to say is something
71-2_1115.89_2.82.wav_ASR	oh i'll all these faces that i useta be able to say
71-2_1118.87_0.92.wav_ASR	and i start to say
71-2_1119.99_1.393.wav_ASR	and i forget what they're in the middle
71-2_1122.11_1.8.wav_ASR	standing room only
71-2_1124.33_0.389.wav_ASR	yeah we
71-2_1124.719_2.671.wav_ASR	he fell up the place safely in case of a accident
71-2_1127.69_1.1.wav_ASR	and everybody's excited
71-2_1129.59_0.76.wav_ASR	did they hate us
71-2_1130.57_2.4.wav_ASR	and that's what we became with
71-2_1133.59_0.94.wav_ASR	and oh my god
71-2_1136.424_12.445.wav_ASR	so there were times that i missed the whole thing because of years i was on line writing a letter that never gave us where we were
71-2_1189.34_19.84.wav_ASR	well since to be taken places in neighborhood neighborhoods the homes are relatively close to each other
71-2_1209.06_5.336.wav_ASR	and it looks like what's going on is a boy is in the back yard
71-2_1214.88_2.2.wav_ASR	and he's playing with his soccer
71-2_1217.52_1.92.wav_ASR	he's he's carrying his carryon
71-2_1220.38_11.126.wav_ASR	and unfortunately this time the ball the ball does not go where he hoped it would and crash into the window
71-2_1232.06_5.1.wav_ASR	and it looks like it might've been the window of his next door neighbor
71-2_1237.38_1.26.wav_ASR	but it could've been his father too
71-2_1238.86_0.86.wav_ASR	it's difficult to explain
71-2_1239.78_7.2.wav_ASR	but it was a window that was next to the yard in which he was playing with his soccer ball
71-2_1247.88_3.96.wav_ASR	well hit the the glass of the window and broke it
71-2_1252.48_4.08.wav_ASR	and unfortunately there was a man that was sitting in the chair right next to the window
71-2_1257.78_7.66.wav_ASR	and the soccer ball not only broke the window but went through completely into the the house
71-2_1266.32_2.88.wav_ASR	so apparently they have no screams from what i'm guessing
71-2_1269.48_2.687.wav_ASR	so it can't be verified because we have screw screws here
71-2_1272.167_11.407.wav_ASR	and in any case the ball ended up in the house in the house in the room desperately where the man was sitting
71-2_1284.62_3.27.wav_ASR	and he was not placed above this
71-2_1288.15_5.76.wav_ASR	he stood up and looked out the window to try to figure out who had broken the window
71-2_1294.2_1.43.wav_ASR	where did the ball come from
71-2_1295.93_9.0.wav_ASR	and who is the person who dropped that ball towards his window
71-2_1305.71_7.06.wav_ASR	he's it's clearly that there's going to be some kind of ramming as a result of this
71-2_1313.51_3.88.wav_ASR	because if it's his son his son is going to be school
71-2_1317.638_12.22.wav_ASR	and if it's his neighbor he's gonna expect an apology and probably some sort of pain to repair the the glass that's been broken
71-2_1331.61_2.368.wav_ASR	so drama in the super
71-2_1351.36_23.18.wav_ASR	well we're gonna tell we're gonna tell this story mother knows best which is a play on the fact that there's a play on the fact that they're assassins who's called father knows best because it's from nineteen fifty or sixty
71-2_1374.637_1.24.wav_ASR	and it was very painful
71-2_1376.717_2.203.wav_ASR	you know the father leave
71-2_1379.217_1.12.wav_ASR	and mother is the housewife
71-2_1380.877_2.16.wav_ASR	the father knows best
71-2_1383.339_19.92.wav_ASR	and in any case this particular story is gonna be mother knows best this is really accidental more contemporary i would say as a general oh no the mother's generally i would say as a general you know no better than their children
71-2_1403.327_4.073.wav_ASR	but all always but in this particular case that's exactly what happened
71-2_1407.4_17.237.wav_ASR	and and what's going on is this child and this child's mother is demanding over whether this boy needs to take an umbrella with him when he leaves
71-2_1424.637_5.175.wav_ASR	and the mother is saying because she they're getting ready for the boy to go off in his home
71-2_1430.477_1.44.wav_ASR	and the mother is saying
71-2_1432.357_10.134.wav_ASR	and on what we see with the clothes that are outside of the sky and what we see on the radar is it looks like it's gonna rain
71-2_1442.577_1.295.wav_ASR	so i think you should take an umbrella
71-2_1443.872_2.02.wav_ASR	and a little boy is going like
71-2_1446.272_1.58.wav_ASR	and i'm not taking an umbrella
71-2_1448.132_1.546.wav_ASR	and i don't need one
71-2_1450.032_1.204.wav_ASR	and i don't care if it rains
71-2_1451.572_0.969.wav_ASR	oh not gonna mail
71-2_1453.572_2.904.wav_ASR	hey i'm fine on my own
71-2_1457.132_0.708.wav_ASR	so she says
71-2_1458.152_1.904.wav_ASR	well alright you know best
71-2_1460.812_1.116.wav_ASR	see she's goodbye to him
71-2_1462.212_0.403.wav_ASR	and they were like
71-2_1462.615_2.1.wav_ASR	if she's still holding the umbrella
71-2_1465.335_0.768.wav_ASR	he hides up
71-2_1466.655_2.06.wav_ASR	and it's not just a spring
71-2_1468.935_3.82.wav_ASR	but it really really starts to rain really hard
71-2_1472.915_1.22.wav_ASR	it's a downtown place
71-2_1475.7_2.625.wav_ASR	and he doesn't know how to handle it
71-2_1478.655_2.945.wav_ASR	so the rain is getting inside
71-2_1481.94_2.26.wav_ASR	and he's getting really really wet
71-2_1484.32_4.93.wav_ASR	and his clothes are getting drenched and saturated with water
71-2_1489.82_1.78.wav_ASR	so he gets about hippopotter
71-2_1492.22_1.78.wav_ASR	and he can't even see what was going on
71-2_1494.3_3.58.wav_ASR	so he heads back to his mother very high
71-2_1499.24_0.76.wav_ASR	they looked at him
71-2_1501.22_2.46.wav_ASR	and she has the grass not to say
71-2_1503.88_0.744.wav_ASR	we told you so
71-2_1505.06_1.279.wav_ASR	because mother's no best
71-2_1506.48_1.32.wav_ASR	and they knew that that never worked
71-2_1508.74_1.78.wav_ASR	and he stands there and looks at her
71-2_1510.86_1.98.wav_ASR	and she hands them the umbrella
71-2_1513.76_0.96.wav_ASR	and he hid off again
71-2_1515.14_3.02.wav_ASR	and this time remembering in his brain
71-2_1519.26_3.04.wav_ASR	my mother's not always wrong about everything
71-2_1524.14_4.02.wav_ASR	and but of course he forget it by the next week when something else comes up
71-2_1528.48_7.687.wav_ASR	where are you in this week he is now superior his mother actually has that he does not yet have
71-2_1536.5_2.081.wav_ASR	and i met my mother as a matter of fact
71-2_1555.22_3.121.wav_ASR	well speaking of dronin in the neighborhood
71-2_1559.54_8.9.wav_ASR	what had happened here behind because the cat was sitting on the branch
71-2_1569.36_3.67.wav_ASR	and the cat has the right to sit on the the top
71-2_1573.78_3.17.wav_ASR	but next door neighbor hasta dog
71-2_1576.95_6.958.wav_ASR	and the dog came out and immediately saw the cat and ran over and started barking at the cat
71-2_1584.11_1.22.wav_ASR	and the cat was soaked
71-2_1586.07_5.36.wav_ASR	so the cat ran from the dog and ran up the tree because that was close
71-2_1591.15_6.0.wav_ASR	and that was a way to get away from the dog because the dog couldn't climb
71-2_1597.65_2.042.wav_ASR	so the cat climbed up the tree
71-2_1600.41_0.894.wav_ASR	don't see your clock
71-2_1601.49_6.55.wav_ASR	it's a cat that just barely a kitten isn't really a cousin to be that high up
71-2_1608.43_1.61.wav_ASR	so the cat crawled up
71-2_1610.78_6.66.wav_ASR	the little girl ran out saw her cat was up in the tree and called her father and says
71-2_1619.16_1.18.wav_ASR	the cat is up in the tree
71-2_1621.04_3.96.wav_ASR	and she's out on the bar
71-2_1625.76_9.82.wav_ASR	and it doesn't look like she's finding her way to get back out because she's mourning you know very loudly and clearly wants to be rescued
71-2_1636.4_1.22.wav_ASR	so please help me
71-2_1638.16_2.86.wav_ASR	please help me get my cat out of the tree
71-2_1641.3_3.6.wav_ASR	so the father's trying to be shielded and the creature
71-2_1645.16_4.36.wav_ASR	so he immediately goes into the grass and finds his ladder
71-2_1650.2_21.487.wav_ASR	and the plant for him was he would simply be able to climb up the the ladder get it inside his shirt fell down and hand it to his shoulder
71-2_1671.68_2.39.wav_ASR	and then he could be you know the heir
71-2_1674.76_5.62.wav_ASR	he could fulfill his daughter's request
71-2_1681.42_2.26.wav_ASR	and fortunately he got up in the tree
71-2_1684.54_10.49.wav_ASR	and he he hadn't previously tested the ladder against the tree in the way he really needed
71-2_1695.33_1.1.wav_ASR	and it fell
71-2_1697.33_4.1.wav_ASR	so now we have two people that hafta be rescued from the tree
71-2_1701.65_7.1.wav_ASR	we have the cat that is still meowing loudly out in the far end
71-2_1709.29_12.14.wav_ASR	and of course the father can't reach it because he's his weight is too heavy to be moved into those limbs without breaking them down
71-2_1721.65_1.78.wav_ASR	and then he would fall down get hurt
71-2_1724.19_6.76.wav_ASR	so at this point the mother who knows best has called the fire department and says
71-2_1731.81_2.587.wav_ASR	we got a susterftoft going on here
71-2_1734.59_1.211.wav_ASR	so that is what she said
71-2_1735.801_6.58.wav_ASR	but that's what she thought in her mind because she doesn't want them to know about her family
71-2_1742.881_2.24.wav_ASR	can you please bring it
71-2_1745.553_16.023.wav_ASR	unfortunately we now need help from firefighters to not only get the cat out of the tree but my husband tried to climb up to help rescue the cat
71-2_1761.576_6.523.wav_ASR	and my daughter is still happy because she's worried about the cat
71-2_1768.376_1.494.wav_ASR	and now she's worried about her dad
71-2_1770.876_2.274.wav_ASR	and the dog is still barking
71-2_1773.756_3.1.wav_ASR	but she's about ready as she's about ready is she's about ready
71-2_1777.576_1.228.wav_ASR	because the firefighters are here
71-2_1779.076_1.061.wav_ASR	and they're coming over
71-2_1780.05_2.35.wav_ASR	and they're going to help the man get down first
71-2_1782.71_3.09.wav_ASR	and then they're going to reach out and get the cat
71-2_1786.3_8.752.wav_ASR	and what the mother's gonna do is she's gonna go and grab the dog and put him in the other room so that everybody will relax a bit
71-2_1796.11_3.213.wav_ASR	and everybody can make it out of the tree without getting hurt
71-2_1799.323_1.586.wav_ASR	and he says
71-2_2004.09_16.38.wav_ASR	and what we're essentially looking for here is accidentably linked to here is that the criteria level and software mobility and physical mobility issues in order to improve their situation in surgery
71-2_2021.77_1.86.wav_ASR	so we're gonna start with that
71-2_2023.99_13.24.wav_ASR	and this is an example of the very restrictive rules that were available to women in certain cities and certain services
71-2_2038.46_5.74.wav_ASR	now what we're seeing here a family which is fully middle class
71-2_2045.26_10.16.wav_ASR	and the in both cases what we had were two families with children
71-2_2056.56_3.02.wav_ASR	and each of them had a spouse that died
71-2_2061.01_13.758.wav_ASR	the husband had one daughter who was living with him
71-2_2075.16_1.256.wav_ASR	but his wife had died
71-2_2076.416_3.656.wav_ASR	so he had a a young daughter who was about six years old
71-2_2080.296_11.24.wav_ASR	and again in europe saturday we'll we'll say nineteen century men could not raise their own children
71-2_2091.936_1.731.wav_ASR	they hadta have a a woman
71-2_2093.856_0.741.wav_ASR	that was her role
71-2_2094.68_3.78.wav_ASR	the people were relatively rich in terms of what they were allowed to do
71-2_2099.12_3.78.wav_ASR	so he hadta find a wife in order to care for his daughter
71-2_2103.96_13.22.wav_ASR	in in another part of town relative small station we have a man in waltham man and wife who had two children
71-2_2118.02_0.76.wav_ASR	and he does
71-2_2119.64_8.66.wav_ASR	so the only way that she would be able to survive as a female is to find a wife or find a mother that would marry her
71-2_2129.4_2.86.wav_ASR	so they're both out looking for another woman
71-2_2133.36_1.3.wav_ASR	and they meet each other
71-2_2135.0_28.16.wav_ASR	and of course what the husband is looking for is someone that will take his mother as something that they've hadta do because we have very resistant very difficult restrictions that they operate in this situation
71-2_2164.74_1.14.wav_ASR	so they meet each other
71-2_2166.5_3.74.wav_ASR	and he's gone in the effect that she's gonna be a wonderful wife
71-2_2170.64_3.8.wav_ASR	and she suddenly gasps all over his head
71-2_2175.66_1.62.wav_ASR	and so they they married
71-2_2177.28_12.12.wav_ASR	they're now three children from her original family his daughter named cinderella from his family
71-2_2189.86_2.76.wav_ASR	and they've now blended into this new society
71-2_2193.69_11.26.wav_ASR	the father then follows his rule which is go out and make money for the family and leaves the house under the management of the stepmother
71-2_2205.31_21.673.wav_ASR	the stepmother on the other hand has not fulfilled her problem but instead has decided that he's going to favor her her stepdaughters and is going to treat the other stepdaughters as if she's a maid
71-2_2227.87_6.94.wav_ASR	and for whatever reason the father does not appear in what he sees when he is home
71-2_2235.41_10.02.wav_ASR	and so what we have is this this really terrible situation that exists for cinderella
71-2_2245.527_4.893.wav_ASR	and cinderella again had had a beautiful mother who loved her
71-2_2250.667_1.201.wav_ASR	and she was close to her father
71-2_2252.027_0.76.wav_ASR	and she lost her mom
71-2_2253.147_9.1.wav_ASR	and now she's also in this situation where she's clearly treated differently than her stepsisters stepmother
71-2_2262.887_2.555.wav_ASR	seventy percent aphasia speech therapy
71-2_2265.442_1.074.wav_ASR	he happens all the time
71-2_2267.022_0.954.wav_ASR	anyway moving on
71-2_2269.122_1.278.wav_ASR	and they lived inside of it
71-2_2270.462_8.32.wav_ASR	there's no way that woman can improve their their position in this situation except through marriage
71-2_2279.762_2.46.wav_ASR	just the only possibility to them
71-2_2282.222_18.073.wav_ASR	and so their primary role is to learn how to handle a house and also be attacked to the head head a head of neurosurgery practitioner that are available to them
71-2_2300.295_2.36.wav_ASR	and i don't know what happens if they're not hysterectomy
71-2_2303.295_2.211.wav_ASR	and i i guess they just face it
71-2_2305.815_2.972.wav_ASR	in any case that's not part of this particular story
71-2_2309.455_1.22.wav_ASR	and she's scared
71-2_2310.915_3.032.wav_ASR	and so that's one concept she doesn't have to deal with
71-2_2313.947_8.6.wav_ASR	and in any case on the other side of the city at a fire flash is
71-2_2323.465_20.82.wav_ASR	and again while the prince has essentially a lot of accident he's at the top of his castle and social status he's also offered to marry
71-2_2344.363_9.7.wav_ASR	because the plan is that he will marry a wife and that wife will then bear him children
71-2_2354.443_6.44.wav_ASR	and those children then mean that they will continue onto the next generation
71-2_2361.383_1.861.wav_ASR	so he may not wanna get married
71-2_2363.24_6.92.wav_ASR	and we don't really know what his genetic genotype is or ancestry
71-2_2370.56_2.72.wav_ASR	but he's he understands what his job is
71-2_2373.42_1.38.wav_ASR	he hasta find a wife
71-2_2375.14_1.42.wav_ASR	he has to find a partner
71-2_2377.46_11.7.wav_ASR	and his plan is to find someone who's relatively attractive while he focuses on the object of his interest in the relationship of his ex
71-2_2389.76_4.76.wav_ASR	so the plan is he's gonna get this over with quickly
71-2_2394.609_4.6.wav_ASR	they'll have this huge dance this whole whole ball
71-2_2400.449_1.88.wav_ASR	and everyone in the kingdom
71-2_2403.749_2.623.wav_ASR	hey i'm assuming we're pretty much middle class in boston
71-2_2406.669_3.7.wav_ASR	he's not really going to the patient track test class
71-2_2410.569_1.731.wav_ASR	it's not part of this at all
71-2_2413.36_14.64.wav_ASR	is inviting all of the eligible females who would like to be married to come in orbit for him so that he can walk through and make his way
71-2_2429.0_1.96.wav_ASR	again this is clearly
71-2_2432.56_5.54.wav_ASR	so almost like that balanced show which i've never seen and never would see it
71-2_2438.84_2.588.wav_ASR	but i certainly know after that
71-2_2441.428_16.26.wav_ASR	but that that woman are gonna be tested and graded and charged out of a line of a line the way he is deciding he's going to mate with
71-2_2458.96_11.18.wav_ASR	so anyway all three of these women the two stepsisters and cinderella all know that they're eligible
71-2_2470.64_6.62.wav_ASR	and they all start thinking about how wonderful their the situation would be if they get shot
71-2_2477.759_2.965.wav_ASR	and again what interests is we're not talking about loud
71-2_2480.919_2.54.wav_ASR	you're not talking about you know
71-2_2485.819_3.132.wav_ASR	we're not talking about people that are compatible with each other
71-2_2489.099_5.541.wav_ASR	we will be talking about they will be able enough for this male to choose them
71-2_2495.14_6.668.wav_ASR	and then their life situation will improve because those of the only options that are available to them
71-2_2502.2_11.34.wav_ASR	and it's a very representative severity in a certain time in in color which is very very disturbing for female patients
71-2_2514.72_1.813.wav_ASR	so they're they're all getting ready
71-2_2516.76_1.25.wav_ASR	and they know what they hafta do
71-2_2518.04_0.98.wav_ASR	they have to look at it
71-2_2519.46_1.52.wav_ASR	so they hafta have a really nice dress
71-2_2521.32_1.34.wav_ASR	and her hair useta be fixed up
71-2_2522.8_14.67.wav_ASR	and they hafta some how make them stand out from the others in order to be chosen in this decoration test that they're gonna be entered into
71-2_2538.05_7.3.wav_ASR	so because the stepmother favors her own daughters she pulls out whatever money they have available
71-2_2545.61_13.82.wav_ASR	and she gets them the the fancy dress that you could possibly choose and you know with hair dresses in to get them as pretty as possible
71-2_2560.48_2.99.wav_ASR	and cinderella pretty much knows that she's on her way to home
71-2_2563.97_8.22.wav_ASR	so she pulls out a book that she got from her mother which has patterns of dresses
71-2_2572.57_8.51.wav_ASR	and because she's hadta do a lot of meal work in very quiet and very quiet work she knows how to so
71-2_2581.9_5.18.wav_ASR	so she pulls together some scraps of material that are available to her
71-2_2587.26_3.6.wav_ASR	and she puts together this really cold dress really
71-2_2591.12_1.64.wav_ASR	and i mean it's kinda off the shore
71-2_2593.16_3.109.wav_ASR	and you'll kind of pink which kinda plays off her hair
71-2_2597.18_1.602.wav_ASR	and she's ready to go
71-2_2599.24_1.68.wav_ASR	and she's doing the best that she did
71-2_2600.92_1.16.wav_ASR	and that's what she has available
71-2_2602.7_0.86.wav_ASR	and she's ready
71-2_2603.98_2.02.wav_ASR	and of course her mother says
71-2_2606.3_1.06.wav_ASR	they're no children's stuff
71-2_2609.46_2.94.wav_ASR	you are not of our story
71-2_2612.88_1.4.wav_ASR	you are a patient
71-2_2615.14_2.22.wav_ASR	and you don't have the right clothes for it
71-2_2617.64_1.2.wav_ASR	you are dressed correctly
71-2_2619.54_0.74.wav_ASR	you are not gonna
71-2_2620.5_1.42.wav_ASR	my daughters are going
71-2_2622.98_4.02.wav_ASR	and they the stepsisters of course have gotten their hook from their mother
71-2_2627.22_1.94.wav_ASR	and they know to be really really cold to her
71-2_2629.38_1.02.wav_ASR	so they left at her
71-2_2631.4_4.92.wav_ASR	and she goes out in the barn to take care of the animals because that's kind of her reason
71-2_2636.32_4.32.wav_ASR	but that's the place where she can and get some kind of affection from the other end
71-2_2641.04_0.764.wav_ASR	and she's out there
71-2_2642.1_1.3.wav_ASR	and you know she's saying
71-2_2644.4_2.137.wav_ASR	and she's wearing her dress and her
71-2_2647.06_1.593.wav_ASR	you know she doesn't know what she's gonna do
71-2_2648.78_0.6.wav_ASR	what is she doing
71-2_2649.62_7.806.wav_ASR	what can she possibly do what can she possibly do to somehow get out of the medical situation that she's in
71-2_2657.46_8.42.wav_ASR	and this fairy godmother appears to her because she you know a wonderful person
71-2_2666.1_1.27.wav_ASR	he's giving to other people
71-2_2667.6_1.24.wav_ASR	and she discovers it
71-2_2669.7_4.22.wav_ASR	so this fairy godmother shows up and says
71-2_2674.82_0.58.wav_ASR	are you cold
71-2_2675.52_0.52.wav_ASR	and what's wrong
71-2_2676.1_0.7.wav_ASR	what do you mean
71-2_2677.62_0.66.wav_ASR	and she says
71-2_2678.52_2.04.wav_ASR	and i would like to go to the the ball
71-2_2680.9_1.26.wav_ASR	but i want to wear
71-2_2682.56_1.04.wav_ASR	and i don't wanna be late at that
71-2_2683.76_3.48.wav_ASR	and i wanna have the appropriate clothes that i i
71-2_2687.6_1.84.wav_ASR	you'll be dressed well like everybody
71-2_2689.8_7.06.wav_ASR	so i won't have the same options that my stepsisters have
71-2_2697.8_0.58.wav_ASR	so she says
71-2_2699.7_0.6.wav_ASR	here all
71-2_2700.72_5.86.wav_ASR	and she you know uses her her magic abilities
71-2_2707.42_0.56.wav_ASR	and she looks around
71-2_2708.52_7.98.wav_ASR	and she transforms the rats into horses that will be pulling a carriage
71-2_2716.86_3.12.wav_ASR	and the coach carriage is transformed from a pumpkin
71-2_2721.2_4.98.wav_ASR	and she uses her wand and and goes over cinderella's
71-2_2726.24_11.79.wav_ASR	and all of a sudden she's wearing these ornate dials heavily affected heavily behind your nose diagonally
71-2_2738.29_8.18.wav_ASR	her hair is is made up in the the the liquid
71-2_2747.67_2.25.wav_ASR	and she's got beautiful makeup on
71-2_2750.27_1.14.wav_ASR	and she looks gorgeous
71-2_2752.87_4.26.wav_ASR	and her fairy godmother says to her
71-2_2758.27_1.606.wav_ASR	go to the ball
71-2_2759.97_1.155.wav_ASR	you deserve this

71-2_2766.17_5.725.wav_ASR	at midnight the horses will be transformed back into rats
71-2_2772.51_4.809.wav_ASR	the carriage will be transformed back into a pumpkin
71-2_2778.35_9.98.wav_ASR	and the rags that are wearing will or the fancy ball dress that your wearing will be transformed back into
71-2_2789.37_2.005.wav_ASR	so please go
71-2_2791.95_0.762.wav_ASR	and have fun
71-2_2792.712_5.46.wav_ASR	but received this is just a moment out of your experience
71-2_2798.512_7.04.wav_ASR	but this is a special bulb that that is hitting your your eyes
71-2_2805.892_1.758.wav_ASR	but it's not really gonna change everything
71-2_2808.012_1.558.wav_ASR	but please enjoy your moment
71-2_2810.63_3.14.wav_ASR	so she hugs the fairy godmother
71-2_2814.41_1.88.wav_ASR	and she gets in the cold
71-2_2817.21_2.2.wav_ASR	and she's taken to the
71-2_2820.33_0.36.wav_ASR	you guess
71-2_2821.17_8.52.wav_ASR	even her stepsisters don't know whose this woman is because she's dressed so magically that she stands out
71-2_2830.55_10.16.wav_ASR	all they all all all the other people that were watching all they can think of is she must be from a really rich family
71-2_2842.35_1.34.wav_ASR	and we don't know of her
71-2_2843.97_3.16.wav_ASR	but she must be from a very high soil
71-2_2847.65_1.71.wav_ASR	and she's clearly very beautiful
71-2_2849.56_5.5.wav_ASR	mean the fact that they don't even recognize their own stepson is pretty timely
71-2_2855.87_1.702.wav_ASR	and in any case she walks in
71-2_2858.34_8.7.wav_ASR	the prince immediately in his opinion in his opinion saw her and says
71-2_2867.361_0.856.wav_ASR	he's the stand up
71-2_2868.82_1.51.wav_ASR	and she's the one
71-2_2870.72_1.77.wav_ASR	and he hid over there
71-2_2872.76_1.61.wav_ASR	and he immediately looked at me
71-2_2874.58_5.47.wav_ASR	he sees that she's so beautiful on top of being wild clearly wild and well dressed
71-2_2880.91_1.45.wav_ASR	and she's also great friends
71-2_2882.78_0.91.wav_ASR	and she's a wonderful dancer
71-2_2884.34_0.31.wav_ASR	thank you
71-2_2885.36_1.74.wav_ASR	and there's some additive
71-2_2887.88_2.89.wav_ASR	and there's there's cemeteries between
71-2_2891.62_0.875.wav_ASR	and he says
71-2_2893.18_1.008.wav_ASR	he's thinking his mind
71-2_2894.42_1.321.wav_ASR	and i thought this was gonna be all
71-2_2896.04_2.52.wav_ASR	and i thought this was gonna be a dirty dirty
71-2_2898.78_2.795.wav_ASR	but i really liked her
71-2_2902.0_1.34.wav_ASR	and this is this
71-2_2903.86_2.26.wav_ASR	so i was hoping for something this magical
71-2_2906.281_1.956.wav_ASR	and i was prepared for something else
71-2_2908.461_1.931.wav_ASR	but this this condition worked
71-2_2910.761_2.955.wav_ASR	so he wants to spend time with her as much as he can
71-2_2913.941_0.479.wav_ASR	and i said
71-2_2914.681_0.98.wav_ASR	and she's into it too
71-2_2915.801_1.52.wav_ASR	they're they're really connected
71-2_2917.761_1.52.wav_ASR	it's just this wonderful bike
71-2_2920.001_4.289.wav_ASR	and then she looks up at the clock and sees that is five minutes to midnight
71-2_2926.49_28.8.wav_ASR	and she knows because of this whole whole process that she lives in as soon not this while she sees what she does that she realizes that she's really not this wild child in his kingdom who she's wearing
71-2_2956.938_4.418.wav_ASR	he she knows that that illusion will also be gone
71-2_2961.538_9.22.wav_ASR	and she she's pretty sure that what he really wanted is the the trapping the animals all the stuff that goes along with them
71-2_2971.438_5.015.wav_ASR	so she knows that as soon as he sees who she really is it's gonna be over
71-2_2976.453_4.78.wav_ASR	so she raises away as quickly as she wants to get away she
71-2_2981.093_8.34.wav_ASR	but she doesn't wanna see the look in his eyes when he sees who she really is and how she's really dressed
71-2_2990.23_2.14.wav_ASR	so he he doesn't understand what happened
71-2_2992.653_0.437.wav_ASR	where is she going
71-2_2993.173_0.717.wav_ASR	and what did he say
71-2_2994.053_1.277.wav_ASR	did you say something to firstnamea
71-2_2995.46_1.51.wav_ASR	and where she hadn't
71-2_2997.36_6.02.wav_ASR	and she raises away as quickly as she can so quickly that she trips on her shoe
71-2_3003.6_0.62.wav_ASR	and she tried
71-2_3004.74_1.712.wav_ASR	and her shoe falls off
71-2_3006.6_1.342.wav_ASR	and she doesn't have time to grab it
71-2_3008.32_0.93.wav_ASR	and she's gotta get going
71-2_3009.56_0.89.wav_ASR	and she's gonna get away
71-2_3010.96_1.49.wav_ASR	so she makes it around the corner
71-2_3012.45_3.64.wav_ASR	and apparently it happened
71-2_3016.65_9.027.wav_ASR	the the ball dress is transformed back into her ragged
71-2_3025.677_7.746.wav_ASR	the pumpkin luckily she didn't get into it because i don't know what would happen if she was actually inside the pumpkin
71-2_3033.917_1.461.wav_ASR	it's gone
71-2_3035.637_0.493.wav_ASR	it's tough
71-2_3036.697_2.343.wav_ASR	and the the horses are gone
71-2_3039.7_1.22.wav_ASR	they're rattled yeah
71-2_3041.9_5.82.wav_ASR	so she walks home snags in the back because you know they don't care what she's doing
71-2_3047.96_2.44.wav_ASR	he could be out in the the barn or whatever
71-2_3051.18_1.98.wav_ASR	and she remembers her mom
71-2_3053.64_0.44.wav_ASR	and she says
71-2_3054.52_2.96.wav_ASR	hey i got to see what it was like to be on the other side of it
71-2_3058.28_1.562.wav_ASR	maybe i can be content
71-2_3059.842_2.694.wav_ASR	and maybe there's some other way that i can get out of here
71-2_3062.542_1.178.wav_ASR	but at least i had
71-2_3064.362_9.62.wav_ASR	least i know that if i had the appropriate clothes i could walk into a scenario at that level and i could stuff
71-2_3075.322_2.431.wav_ASR	at midnight he's back in the palace
71-2_3078.142_1.402.wav_ASR	and he's chasing after her
71-2_3079.8_11.914.wav_ASR	it's point it's you know kind of the socalis of what's going on in his brain is getting all this one is playing hard because she left
71-2_3092.42_1.26.wav_ASR	so there's kind of a mystery there
71-2_3093.8_0.92.wav_ASR	and he's stuck the shoe
71-2_3095.48_0.44.wav_ASR	and he says
71-2_3096.62_2.419.wav_ASR	hey i want that woman
71-2_3099.039_1.554.wav_ASR	and he says that to his father
71-2_3101.459_0.874.wav_ASR	yeah i will get married
71-2_3102.659_1.457.wav_ASR	how do you want me to do
71-2_3104.319_1.26.wav_ASR	feel my obligation
71-2_3106.019_2.317.wav_ASR	but i'm only gonna marry a woman i want to be with
71-2_3108.479_1.188.wav_ASR	and i decided who it is
71-2_3109.899_0.481.wav_ASR	it's her
71-2_3110.579_0.492.wav_ASR	the prince
71-2_3111.559_1.82.wav_ASR	the misty one
71-2_3113.739_1.359.wav_ASR	and i've got her shoe
71-2_3115.098_9.104.wav_ASR	so all i hafta do now is go around and see if i can figure out who's fit whose foot will fit into that shoe
71-2_3124.478_2.226.wav_ASR	and then that will be the person
71-2_3126.704_14.559.wav_ASR	because he's beginning to understand in his mind that there's some moments of this situation which is that they're human beings that transcend their society and how much money they make
71-2_3141.263_17.44.wav_ASR	and he's beginning to think if they their souls could just soul mate that that would be something that they could just relax in society was
71-2_3158.75_4.86.wav_ASR	so he's thinking at this point he's thinking much more broadly than his father is
71-2_3163.91_2.82.wav_ASR	and so they got this this bar
71-2_3167.87_7.62.wav_ASR	if he can find a woman who feet fit into those glass slippers he will know who that person is
71-2_3175.61_0.918.wav_ASR	and then i'll look at her
71-2_3176.528_4.36.wav_ASR	and he'll be able to know that that's the person that his his tree
71-2_3181.928_1.599.wav_ASR	and that's the person that he will end up
71-2_3184.23_8.169.wav_ASR	and because the way side works is if you're right you can carry down but if it hasta be their choice
71-2_3192.59_7.512.wav_ASR	if you're poor and you wanna be moved as some kind of special care
71-2_3200.21_5.812.wav_ASR	so you might need some right to reach down in some way
71-2_3207.09_0.38.wav_ASR	so yeah
71-2_3208.27_0.924.wav_ASR	he's male
71-2_3209.37_0.56.wav_ASR	and she's saying
71-2_3210.23_5.02.wav_ASR	and giving the patient level of them she doesn't get to ask him
71-2_3215.67_1.58.wav_ASR	he hasta ask her
71-2_3217.53_2.64.wav_ASR	and this is this goes back two hundred years
71-2_3220.23_10.62.wav_ASR	and this is the way in which your contract in terms of what people could do things
71-2_3232.95_1.66.wav_ASR	so he's going around
71-2_3234.63_9.058.wav_ASR	and of course this is clearly a really interesting way to find the mother that he's actually looking for the mistreatment woman who got away
71-2_3244.37_1.53.wav_ASR	but he's no else what to do
71-2_3246.27_1.395.wav_ASR	and he's excited
71-2_3248.05_0.952.wav_ASR	you just the one i want
71-2_3249.19_4.215.wav_ASR	who saw the woman you know with the the great carriage
71-2_3253.405_1.7.wav_ASR	and he's called nine one one
71-2_3255.445_1.264.wav_ASR	everybody is looking for her
71-2_3256.825_0.684.wav_ASR	they can't find her
71-2_3258.025_3.705.wav_ASR	so we're gonna start with the shoe because he's got something in front of him
71-2_3262.625_10.345.wav_ASR	and they activated that he could see if wind would come forward to see if he can find the woman that would fit the shoe
71-2_3273.59_2.54.wav_ASR	so of course the stepdaughters
71-2_3276.77_4.492.wav_ASR	he he passed his by the night of the ball
71-2_3281.67_5.34.wav_ASR	but all we gotta do at this point is get our feet to fit into that shoe
71-2_3287.15_7.66.wav_ASR	and of course they're looking at this in a really superficial kind of way because he knows that as soon as he finds the right woman
71-2_3298.01_6.16.wav_ASR	and clearly even if those shoes did fit the stepdaughter's it wouldn't match
71-2_3304.47_1.08.wav_ASR	they're evil you know
71-2_3305.92_1.24.wav_ASR	they'd be no camel
71-2_3307.5_1.43.wav_ASR	but you know they don't understand that
71-2_3309.14_4.5.wav_ASR	they're really behind in terms of understanding human relationships
71-2_3314.91_9.46.wav_ASR	and cinderella is she knows if she has the opportunity to connect with him again she can take her out of the situation that she's in
71-2_3324.63_1.94.wav_ASR	and they did connect
71-2_3326.99_0.66.wav_ASR	they shouldn't
71-2_3327.87_0.666.wav_ASR	what they did
71-2_3328.77_1.6.wav_ASR	it was very important
71-2_3331.15_16.88.wav_ASR	but for whatever reason because of the fairy godmother she's been given that opportunity to step out of her world and move into a the prince's life
71-2_3349.85_4.94.wav_ASR	so when they come up to the house both of the stepdaughters go
71-2_3355.33_3.9.wav_ASR	and they try very hard to see if their feet will fit into the shoe
71-2_3359.65_1.118.wav_ASR	and they they don't
71-2_3361.07_2.251.wav_ASR	doing everything that he can
71-2_3363.39_2.46.wav_ASR	and this point the prince is just very disinterested
71-2_3366.67_1.663.wav_ASR	he doesn't think he's gonna find her again
71-2_3368.45_4.78.wav_ASR	and he'll be stuck with somebody else that his father will probably arrange for him
71-2_3374.21_1.02.wav_ASR	and he finally said
71-2_3375.45_9.07.wav_ASR	there are many women in this house who could possibly be eligible for this
71-2_3385.34_2.26.wav_ASR	and cinderella steps forward
71-2_3388.1_5.46.wav_ASR	and this is the basis she's ever done because her stepmother is just gonna punish her for this after
71-2_3394.22_0.66.wav_ASR	and she says
71-2_3395.354_0.61.wav_ASR	here
71-2_3396.64_1.68.wav_ASR	and the stepmother turns and looks out
71-2_3398.32_11.3.wav_ASR	and she's really you know clearly to punish her and balance her outta the ball prevent her not to eat for a while and really really make her life miserable
71-2_3410.66_4.26.wav_ASR	but the person that's working with the prince says
71-2_3415.8_1.04.wav_ASR	and he said everybody
71-2_3417.006_1.52.wav_ASR	oh my god
71-2_3419.206_5.75.wav_ASR	and she steps forward despite the fact that she was scared at by the family member
71-2_3426.49_1.26.wav_ASR	and she sits down
71-2_3428.266_4.56.wav_ASR	and her foot fits the shoe perfectly
71-2_3433.786_1.224.wav_ASR	the prince looks at her
71-2_3435.486_0.884.wav_ASR	they're eyes meet
71-2_3437.19_5.92.wav_ASR	and then again he's he's wet his head
71-2_3444.51_11.84.wav_ASR	and at that point all of the power that the prince has to protect her from her stepmother is kind of important
71-2_3457.31_6.494.wav_ASR	all of her beautiful clothes come back though were beginning to think this might've been an issue in the first place
71-2_3465.03_1.22.wav_ASR	the stepmother says
71-2_3467.17_0.966.wav_ASR	he's outta my hand
71-2_3468.27_3.048.wav_ASR	so i had no ability to funnel her anymore
71-2_3471.91_15.74.wav_ASR	and the prince pulls her out of there and brings her back to the palace where she has been lived lived
71-2_3488.11_2.18.wav_ASR	and she's gonna hafta learn how to manage her money
71-2_3490.38_2.51.wav_ASR	where she's gonna learn how to talk
71-2_3493.22_6.463.wav_ASR	and she's gonna hafta learn how to conduct herself as a lady
71-2_3500.06_5.22.wav_ASR	all the things that associated with with a higher social class
71-2_3505.28_7.11.wav_ASR	but because they connected at a human level this is gonna work
71-2_3569.68_4.16.wav_ASR	it was just thinking about telling you about the one i told you last time
71-2_3574.16_1.744.wav_ASR	so i'd hafta come up the new one in that
71-2_3575.904_16.746.wav_ASR	when i was in the third grade which means i was very good with being able to read a class
71-2_3594.17_4.66.wav_ASR	but there was some deadlines that i was not completely clear about
71-2_3599.49_5.1.wav_ASR	and one of those is a quarter after on a clock
71-2_3606.01_7.8.wav_ASR	and i mean i certainly knew that the shorter hand or hand was the hour
71-2_3614.27_3.18.wav_ASR	and the long hand was the mind
71-2_3618.41_10.9.wav_ASR	but for my experience from my in my early brain when someone said twenty five feet after it met twenty
71-2_3629.95_0.94.wav_ASR	didn't meet fifty
71-2_3632.237_7.116.wav_ASR	and what happened is my older sister had had stayed home sick that day
71-2_3640.43_4.54.wav_ASR	and i was supposta go to her illinois school teacher
71-2_3645.277_2.053.wav_ASR	and she was in the fifteenth grade
71-2_3647.95_6.86.wav_ASR	and i was supposta get her home home work and bring it home to her so that she could return in the next day
71-2_3655.69_1.8.wav_ASR	and so i went to my teacher and say
71-2_3657.81_4.4.wav_ASR	and i'm sposta go to michigan state
71-2_3662.55_3.64.wav_ASR	and i'm supposta pick up my sister home
71-2_3667.09_0.66.wav_ASR	and she says
71-2_3668.13_1.372.wav_ASR	why didn't you go at quarter after
71-2_3669.502_1.648.wav_ASR	so i says
71-2_3671.37_0.632.wav_ASR	okay i will
71-2_3672.79_7.687.wav_ASR	and i thought quarter after was twenty five minutes after because in my mind that's what made sense
71-2_3680.63_1.36.wav_ASR	the quarter is twenty five minutes
71-2_3682.55_2.16.wav_ASR	it's a quarter is worth twenty five cents
71-2_3685.29_6.464.wav_ASR	so computer after would be three twenty five not three fifteen which is what she's saying
71-2_3691.83_1.241.wav_ASR	cover after the hour
71-2_3693.83_6.8.wav_ASR	so i waited til three twenty five minutes before the school is is close
71-2_3701.57_3.218.wav_ASR	it's way too late for me to be going and doing what i'm supposed to be doing
71-2_3704.71_1.76.wav_ASR	and i was supposta do it ten minutes earlier
71-2_3706.77_5.92.wav_ASR	and i'm watching the clock still slightly three twenty five and getting up and going to do what i'm supposed to do
71-2_3713.17_1.54.wav_ASR	and i ran over
71-2_3715.13_4.3.wav_ASR	and of course it's a mess because i'm missing the end of my class
71-2_3720.41_4.7.wav_ASR	her class is closed down
71-2_3726.15_4.02.wav_ASR	so i get back to my class probably at three thirty five
71-2_3730.99_3.236.wav_ASR	my teacher is still waiting there because my stuff is still in the data
71-2_3734.91_1.24.wav_ASR	did you wait so long
71-2_3736.33_0.6.wav_ASR	and she says
71-2_3737.07_2.17.wav_ASR	and i went exactly when you told me to go
71-2_3739.78_1.66.wav_ASR	you told me to go at cortic vein
71-2_3742.38_0.58.wav_ASR	and she says
71-2_3743.24_2.52.wav_ASR	oh you didn't go til three twenty five
71-2_3746.02_0.42.wav_ASR	and i says
71-2_3746.78_1.46.wav_ASR	but isn't that coffee stuff
71-2_3749.18_19.93.wav_ASR	and so at age of eight i understood finally that when adult say quarter q and their job they mean fifteen minutes after an hour and not twenty five minutes after an hour
71-2_3769.95_0.381.wav_ASR	and he says
71-2_3770.47_0.576.wav_ASR	that's i don't know
71-2_3783.83_0.927.wav_ASR	yeah well to me
71-2_3784.77_0.667.wav_ASR	and i was alive
71-2_3785.65_0.876.wav_ASR	they stink
71-2_3786.87_2.118.wav_ASR	you should you know cut it in quarter after the hour
71-2_3788.988_1.9.wav_ASR	alright upstairs is sixty minutes
71-2_3791.248_1.687.wav_ASR	they just weren't clear about it
71-2_3793.668_2.282.wav_ASR	and not that i actually talked back to
71-2_3796.328_1.262.wav_ASR	and me i was in a coma
71-2_3797.748_1.362.wav_ASR	we never talk back to anyone
71-2_3799.368_1.8.wav_ASR	but i really was just really confused
71-2_3809.35_6.62.wav_ASR	you think of a good bread
71-2_3816.149_18.351.wav_ASR	when i think about this story i think i'm gonna talk about this story i think of at the time when i did it i could back the bird
71-2_3836.08_11.38.wav_ASR	and of course growing up in an affected family which we had very few thanksgiving's i never made my own thanksgiving's i never made my own thanksgiving by myself
71-2_3847.78_2.32.wav_ASR	but generally we would go to my grandmother's house
71-2_3850.98_1.12.wav_ASR	and she had a left shoulder
71-2_3852.94_2.427.wav_ASR	so our job
71-2_3855.367_3.059.wav_ASR	my father was the second oldest of that family
71-2_3859.04_2.22.wav_ASR	how her job was to bring some pills
71-2_3861.92_7.327.wav_ASR	and usually we would bring something else whether it be cranberry or something else bread so
71-2_3869.707_2.393.wav_ASR	we never made the turkey
71-2_3872.607_2.173.wav_ASR	we were never responsible for doing any of them
71-2_3874.78_1.654.wav_ASR	and we were all shopping
71-2_3876.434_0.914.wav_ASR	they're been playing football
71-2_3877.82_5.48.wav_ASR	you know i'd hang up with my in the kitchen with they were kinda rejected that
71-2_3883.46_1.96.wav_ASR	and the man would be in the living room watching football
71-2_3886.28_4.902.wav_ASR	and yeah you would just try to do with those generic rolls
71-2_3891.42_2.44.wav_ASR	but anyway i was by myself
71-2_3893.937_6.46.wav_ASR	oh i think i was a senior in high school
71-2_3903.017_2.6.wav_ASR	and i was working as a waiter
71-2_3906.217_1.753.wav_ASR	and i didn't have a car
71-2_3909.03_2.46.wav_ASR	and i couldn't get enough time off work
71-2_3911.917_1.736.wav_ASR	and i didn't have enough energy there
71-2_3913.653_4.9.wav_ASR	so for whatever reason i hadta work on wednesday before thanksgiving
71-2_3919.253_1.48.wav_ASR	and i was gonna be dry
71-2_3920.873_2.933.wav_ASR	but i was gonna miss this big family aunt
71-2_3924.413_4.96.wav_ASR	but i decided that i had the tracheotomy
71-2_3929.773_1.74.wav_ASR	but i still had trouble
71-2_3931.715_1.84.wav_ASR	but i still had
71-2_3934.135_1.48.wav_ASR	that i still had stress
71-2_3935.995_1.437.wav_ASR	and though there were things i liked anywhere
71-2_3937.995_2.438.wav_ASR	so i was gonna go through this because now i'm an adult right
71-2_3940.455_1.144.wav_ASR	and i know how to do all this
71-2_3941.995_1.475.wav_ASR	and why should i be able to do that
71-2_3943.535_0.973.wav_ASR	it can't be hard
71-2_3945.135_1.145.wav_ASR	it comes out of me
71-2_3946.495_1.92.wav_ASR	it looks like you turn the on
71-2_3948.615_1.065.wav_ASR	you put the turkey
71-2_3949.895_1.065.wav_ASR	you leave it in for a long
71-2_3951.06_1.38.wav_ASR	and eventually you pull it out
71-2_3952.98_1.427.wav_ASR	and then you eat it right
71-2_3954.407_0.765.wav_ASR	can i do that
71-2_3956.5_5.3.wav_ASR	so the tuesday before thanksgiving after i'm calling
71-2_3962.12_0.88.wav_ASR	and everyone was saying
71-2_3963.12_1.013.wav_ASR	you're not gonna be here
71-2_3964.3_1.612.wav_ASR	can't believe you're not gonna be here
71-2_3965.912_1.841.wav_ASR	and i'm feeling all disrupted in all this
71-2_3967.94_2.64.wav_ASR	but i get how i pick up this tree
71-2_3970.948_2.557.wav_ASR	and i don't get a technically big one
71-2_3973.708_0.995.wav_ASR	but it's pretty big
71-2_3974.748_3.832.wav_ASR	but probably twenty pounds which is certainly more than i need
71-2_3979.388_1.599.wav_ASR	but you know i don't know
71-2_3981.128_5.18.wav_ASR	small than the ones that my family has ever used for thanksgiving
71-2_3986.648_1.44.wav_ASR	so i picked up this screw
71-2_3989.32_4.94.wav_ASR	after i get home from work on wednesday i pull it out of the freezer
71-2_3994.86_1.6.wav_ASR	and kinda see where i'm going through with it
71-2_3997.14_1.16.wav_ASR	and i'm pulling out of the fridge
71-2_3998.92_0.655.wav_ASR	and save
71-2_3999.94_8.707.wav_ASR	yeah i think i put it in the morning on thirtieth morning i should be able to eat properly like four o'clock in the afternoon
71-2_4008.6_3.427.wav_ASR	and you know i heard you know how to make pies and all the stuff
71-2_4012.36_2.28.wav_ASR	and i stuck in the water
71-2_4015.16_2.54.wav_ASR	and i put thin foil over it
71-2_4018.12_1.74.wav_ASR	and i got the temporary cure
71-2_4020.98_0.76.wav_ASR	and i put it in
71-2_4022.48_2.3.wav_ASR	and you know in the meantime i'm getting really hungry
71-2_4025.22_1.08.wav_ASR	see the day is going
71-2_4026.96_2.58.wav_ASR	the evil smacks really good
71-2_4030.16_1.799.wav_ASR	oh my god i've already got pie that's there
71-2_4032.82_2.322.wav_ASR	so i bought pie because i have time to bake them
71-2_4035.7_1.44.wav_ASR	and i got to think of food
71-2_4037.36_0.82.wav_ASR	and i'm watching TV
71-2_4038.6_1.326.wav_ASR	and so it's about four o'clock
71-2_4040.14_5.623.wav_ASR	and i avoided my next door neighbor to come over and help thanks me with me
71-2_4045.6_2.7.wav_ASR	and i poured out the juice
71-2_4048.88_8.18.wav_ASR	so i opened the the turkey and take off the the turkey and take off the tin foil
71-2_4058.22_5.156.wav_ASR	and all of a sudden i noticed it's still kind of raw on the top
71-2_4063.76_1.56.wav_ASR	and it says
71-2_4065.473_3.02.wav_ASR	and what apparently i didn't understand you hadta talk them
71-2_4068.773_3.506.wav_ASR	hey i i didn't know that there's actually aross that yeah
71-2_4072.673_10.555.wav_ASR	so what i have is a turkey which is overcooked on the top part of it
71-2_4083.413_1.1.wav_ASR	it was blood everywhere
71-2_4084.791_4.6.wav_ASR	you know you'll have clear eyes
71-2_4089.731_1.877.wav_ASR	and i'm having blood coming out of it
71-2_4092.3_1.672.wav_ASR	so i've got my next neighbor's name
71-2_4094.631_1.127.wav_ASR	so when we gonna eat
71-2_4095.771_0.429.wav_ASR	and i says
71-2_4096.271_1.769.wav_ASR	well it looks like it's not done yet
71-2_4098.231_1.569.wav_ASR	how why is taking this long
71-2_4101.011_1.629.wav_ASR	and i says
71-2_4103.091_0.989.wav_ASR	what else do you need to see the pup
71-2_4104.66_1.34.wav_ASR	so i put it back in the cup
71-2_4106.3_0.82.wav_ASR	we eat the pot
71-2_4107.6_2.94.wav_ASR	we started eating you know whatever i've gotten in the house
71-2_4110.92_3.32.wav_ASR	keep opening the other door and checking it
71-2_4114.46_1.1.wav_ASR	still not done
71-2_4115.9_3.62.wav_ASR	and finally at this point my neighbor says
71-2_4119.66_2.687.wav_ASR	you know i'm not really hungry anymore because we've been eating
71-2_4122.347_5.32.wav_ASR	and i think i had some macaron and cheese in the refrigerator
71-2_4127.947_0.653.wav_ASR	we eat that
71-2_4128.987_0.853.wav_ASR	we already had the pot
71-2_4130.887_1.513.wav_ASR	you know we eating other stuff
71-2_4132.587_2.053.wav_ASR	we're drinking beer pretty much at that point
71-2_4135.127_1.673.wav_ASR	and it still just wasn't done
71-2_4136.987_0.32.wav_ASR	and i says
71-2_4137.427_1.789.wav_ASR	think there's something wrong with my eye
71-2_4139.216_4.64.wav_ASR	for whatever reason this bird did not cup
71-2_4144.716_6.64.wav_ASR	so basically i finally took it out of the refrigerator
71-2_4152.1_1.576.wav_ASR	it was half cockatoo
71-2_4154.1_6.54.wav_ASR	and then i found out the next day from my aunt that it was supposed to be three or four days in advance
71-2_4161.66_3.14.wav_ASR	and that's that's the only way that it's cooked evenly
71-2_4164.8_10.968.wav_ASR	and i told anybody other than my aunt that the reason that my aunt did not work out is not because i forgot the thought
71-2_4175.98_2.66.wav_ASR	because i told her the opposite just didn't work
71-2_4178.98_0.94.wav_ASR	and that's the key
71-2_4180.26_1.499.wav_ASR	that's the one i went with right
71-2_4181.86_0.46.wav_ASR	and i did not know
71-2_4182.62_1.64.wav_ASR	they would've laughed at me forever
71-2_4184.269_5.704.wav_ASR	they lived me for decades for not knowing something as basic as basic as that
71-2_4190.749_3.091.wav_ASR	but it's the first bird i ever tried to feed
71-2_4194.709_2.56.wav_ASR	and there's you needta tell you the date
71-2_4197.749_2.931.wav_ASR	me there's more involved than just sticking in the oil
71-2_4201.309_1.4.wav_ASR	so anyway yeah
71-2_4202.869_1.276.wav_ASR	so i i don't even tell you
71-2_4204.145_0.66.wav_ASR	so i didn't take it
71-2_4205.385_11.22.wav_ASR	the neck was actually inside patient and was stuck inside the throat which i didn't even know because it was too frozen
71-2_4217.465_4.355.wav_ASR	so when i finally was able to get it out i had paper in there too on top
71-2_4222.245_1.467.wav_ASR	yeah kind of a mess
71-2_4223.712_2.033.wav_ASR	especially i ate it
71-2_4225.772_5.36.wav_ASR	and i i just hacked up then kind of cooked it in seconds
71-2_4231.613_1.392.wav_ASR	and you do it all
71-2_4244.36_0.39.wav_ASR	and he says
71-2_4246.12_3.22.wav_ASR	okay
71-2_4250.31_12.91.wav_ASR	when going about hotel that i stayed in when i was living in covid hangover and was traveling with five other people
71-2_4263.273_6.26.wav_ASR	now in this picture case what happened is we were on christmas break
71-2_4270.133_3.68.wav_ASR	so we had a month off in which there were no classes
71-2_4274.793_1.429.wav_ASR	and so all of a sudden
71-2_4276.413_2.08.wav_ASR	we were about twenty five of us there
71-2_4278.663_5.439.wav_ASR	we were between the ages of nineteen and twenty one and were in europe
71-2_4284.483_8.28.wav_ASR	and we have the ability to be able to fly passengers which means actual travel
71-2_4293.323_0.72.wav_ASR	you're basically
71-2_4294.543_3.437.wav_ASR	but i can't remember what it cost at this point
71-2_4297.98_2.54.wav_ASR	but i think it was about hundred dollars you paid
71-2_4300.82_16.44.wav_ASR	and you could essentially go anywhere anywhere as far as where it was on this this realm as far as front as this this realm
71-2_4317.626_3.34.wav_ASR	so you know we had all these ways of trying to do chip
71-2_4321.286_2.024.wav_ASR	and you would sleep on train
71-2_4323.546_4.404.wav_ASR	we would take things at night so that we wouldn't hafta worry about it
71-2_4328.866_1.9.wav_ASR	but we were now
71-2_4331.086_2.44.wav_ASR	we were several of us that were traveling
71-2_4333.686_1.58.wav_ASR	it was with a friend called cathy
71-2_4335.298_4.36.wav_ASR	and we were connecting with sandy and firstnamek
71-2_4339.721_2.975.wav_ASR	and we were coming
71-2_4342.838_1.313.wav_ASR	they lived from somewhere else
71-2_4344.198_2.045.wav_ASR	we're all gonna meet together in world war two
71-2_4346.718_4.949.wav_ASR	and we figured we would all stay in a hotel together to save money
71-2_4351.738_2.52.wav_ASR	we would have i think two beds
71-2_4354.57_1.472.wav_ASR	so there was capacity
71-2_4356.47_1.518.wav_ASR	and one of us would sleep with them
71-2_4357.988_3.735.wav_ASR	and then two women would be in the other the other bit
71-2_4362.65_1.8.wav_ASR	so it's new year right
71-2_4364.61_1.672.wav_ASR	because this is christmas break
71-2_4366.73_2.06.wav_ASR	we arrived in rome
71-2_4369.51_2.46.wav_ASR	and the first thing we would do when
71-2_4372.105_3.44.wav_ASR	and we were gonna meet with each other at the train station
71-2_4376.45_1.74.wav_ASR	we all met at the train station
71-2_4378.485_2.025.wav_ASR	we all got into within a half hour of each hour
71-2_4380.725_0.585.wav_ASR	we connected
71-2_4381.31_17.334.wav_ASR	and the information sent in the first thing we would always do is go to the the internet center in the train station and get out of the system what were you gonna do
71-2_4399.31_1.66.wav_ASR	there's a guy there working
71-2_4400.97_1.48.wav_ASR	and he was about twenty
71-2_4402.65_5.436.wav_ASR	very traumatic accident man who said
71-2_4408.77_2.324.wav_ASR	but he was just trying floundling with us so
71-2_4410.93_1.58.wav_ASR	so they're three american women
71-2_4412.97_0.805.wav_ASR	and this one guy
71-2_4414.09_1.187.wav_ASR	and he's struggling with us
71-2_4415.73_2.32.wav_ASR	and he just said
71-2_4418.51_1.44.wav_ASR	oh you're gonna be in home
71-2_4420.19_0.352.wav_ASR	and we said
71-2_4420.542_1.785.wav_ASR	yeah we're gonna be in a couple days
71-2_4423.022_0.528.wav_ASR	here you are finally
71-2_4423.642_1.191.wav_ASR	that's why we don't have flash
71-2_4425.142_0.92.wav_ASR	we were just struggling
71-2_4426.362_1.68.wav_ASR	we're open to any experience
71-2_4428.462_0.4.wav_ASR	and he says
71-2_4428.922_1.677.wav_ASR	we're gonna have a party tonight
71-2_4431.182_1.62.wav_ASR	would you like to come to our party
71-2_4433.777_1.345.wav_ASR	and of course you know
71-2_4435.601_1.401.wav_ASR	of course we'll come to your party
71-2_4437.262_1.273.wav_ASR	we don't know anybody here
71-2_4438.722_1.324.wav_ASR	how course we'll come to your parties
71-2_4440.046_0.685.wav_ASR	and she sees it
71-2_4440.731_1.855.wav_ASR	we loved to go to an italian party
71-2_4442.966_1.106.wav_ASR	and yeah
71-2_4444.486_4.06.wav_ASR	haven't seen the movie the take in taken which means it could go very different
71-2_4448.786_0.842.wav_ASR	but that's not what happened
71-2_4450.606_1.32.wav_ASR	so we get to our hotel
71-2_4453.086_0.895.wav_ASR	and we checked in
71-2_4454.966_4.62.wav_ASR	and the guy behind the desk looked at all of us and said
71-2_4459.59_1.88.wav_ASR	if you all wanna be in one room together
71-2_4462.21_0.62.wav_ASR	and we said
71-2_4463.448_1.886.wav_ASR	one room two beds
71-2_4466.53_1.558.wav_ASR	and he looked at cabin
71-2_4468.088_2.082.wav_ASR	and and he pulled him aside and said
71-2_4470.79_1.3.wav_ASR	you must be alert
71-2_4472.41_4.094.wav_ASR	if i was in that room i would not be able to sleep the entire night
71-2_4476.504_3.19.wav_ASR	they're retired night with all of these beautiful women around
71-2_4480.57_2.338.wav_ASR	and he he hadn't come out yet
71-2_4482.944_3.806.wav_ASR	but about a year later after that when i all had a routine headache
71-2_4487.104_0.926.wav_ASR	you know i'm i'm gay
71-2_4488.81_0.614.wav_ASR	and i says
71-2_4489.544_1.514.wav_ASR	oh we we didn't know that
71-2_4491.584_4.638.wav_ASR	yeah when i was thinking at the time you know he he actually didn't know he was safe
71-2_4496.25_7.099.wav_ASR	but he said one of the things that made clear to him that he was okay as well as that attitude man had said
71-2_4504.19_3.358.wav_ASR	they wouldn't be able to sleep if i were in the room with these beautiful women
71-2_4508.07_0.96.wav_ASR	and he was thinking
71-2_4509.29_1.838.wav_ASR	you know i'm not interested in anything
71-2_4511.51_1.94.wav_ASR	yeah eventually thought
71-2_4513.97_1.867.wav_ASR	well maybe there's a reason for that
71-2_4515.85_1.695.wav_ASR	yeah but it was me too
71-2_4518.19_2.637.wav_ASR	so we i actually sat with cinderella
71-2_4520.91_0.704.wav_ASR	that was
71-2_4523.37_1.48.wav_ASR	they were not
71-2_4525.51_3.045.wav_ASR	we didn't matter i mean who we were gonna sleep with
71-2_4528.59_1.436.wav_ASR	he was like my brother at that point
71-2_4530.79_1.74.wav_ASR	so cabin and i slept in one bed
71-2_4532.73_0.64.wav_ASR	and it was a dud
71-2_4533.83_2.42.wav_ASR	and sandy and firstnamec slap in the other one
71-2_4536.43_6.242.wav_ASR	and we put all our stuff up you know our backpack in our sleeping bag
71-2_4542.95_1.454.wav_ASR	and then we all went to this party
71-2_4544.65_2.441.wav_ASR	and everybody's really wild dressed at this party
71-2_4547.69_2.18.wav_ASR	we worked teams
71-2_4558.543_1.81.wav_ASR	everybody's all made up
71-2_4560.543_2.446.wav_ASR	and there we are looking looking like we look
71-2_4563.963_5.82.wav_ASR	and the whole thing at the party became the focus of
71-2_4569.795_5.22.wav_ASR	so this guy is sleeping with all three of you in the hotel
71-2_4575.455_8.129.wav_ASR	oh that's all we talked about all night long was just that cinderella had three different women that he was having sex with
71-2_4583.835_2.445.wav_ASR	and so you know that helps
71-2_4586.535_3.105.wav_ASR	why i could be an american man in travel with three women
71-2_4589.64_1.073.wav_ASR	and you know what
71-2_4591.62_1.186.wav_ASR	how can it be so serious
71-2_4593.08_2.472.wav_ASR	oh oh believe by the whole thing
71-2_4595.68_0.879.wav_ASR	and we
71-2_4597.78_4.75.wav_ASR	but what's interesting as on the way back again in the bathroom
71-2_4602.76_3.63.wav_ASR	they happened out of the bathroom the men bathroom and stuff
71-2_4607.06_1.72.wav_ASR	that's had the strange as well
71-2_4609.0_0.74.wav_ASR	and we called nine one one
71-2_4609.96_0.5.wav_ASR	help me
71-2_4610.475_1.125.wav_ASR	and she thought
71-2_4611.66_1.84.wav_ASR	oh i was at the your neurologist
71-2_4614.02_1.751.wav_ASR	and i was standing there
71-2_4615.94_0.733.wav_ASR	and i was pee
71-2_4617.72_1.59.wav_ASR	and all of a sudden this man came
71-2_4619.54_4.24.wav_ASR	and he could've gone to the other side of the road
71-2_4624.08_1.411.wav_ASR	they came and stood right next to me
71-2_4626.74_0.6.wav_ASR	and he says
71-2_4627.405_1.298.wav_ASR	and i don't know what that mean
71-2_4628.703_0.68.wav_ASR	and so i says
71-2_4630.703_0.392.wav_ASR	and i don't know
71-2_4631.095_1.208.wav_ASR	he's italian you know
71-2_4632.523_0.44.wav_ASR	and he says
71-2_4633.223_4.051.wav_ASR	and he had the biggest pheasants i ever seen
71-2_4637.563_0.429.wav_ASR	hotel
71-2_4638.163_1.275.wav_ASR	so some of that
71-2_4640.283_2.322.wav_ASR	thinking about that a year later it kind of made sense
71-2_4642.723_0.997.wav_ASR	at the time i thought
71-2_4643.84_0.556.wav_ASR	and i don't know
71-2_4644.543_1.18.wav_ASR	you this is just what it tells you
71-2_4645.732_10.149.wav_ASR	we just thought administration were so strange men were not able to sleep in a full woman and not be able to sleep when he's exhausted
71-2_4656.872_1.771.wav_ASR	and i could not speak if i was in that room
71-2_4658.952_2.411.wav_ASR	but i just couldn't manage all those women around him
71-2_4661.432_1.043.wav_ASR	we were sharing a bathroom
71-2_4663.072_0.5.wav_ASR	oh my god
71-2_4663.885_1.9.wav_ASR	so anyway yeah
71-2_4665.989_3.342.wav_ASR	that's a better than one where i hadta say
71-2_4669.685_0.92.wav_ASR	we have an accident
71-2_4670.828_2.306.wav_ASR	and which is what i tend to give you last week
71-2_4673.345_2.38.wav_ASR	but i don't have a lot of hotel story
71-2_4676.085_0.796.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
71-2_4677.505_0.76.wav_ASR	that was one of them
71-2_4683.67_0.73.wav_ASR	and he says
71-2_4684.79_1.88.wav_ASR	we're already talking about my ockets
71-2_4687.29_1.19.wav_ASR	so i come up with a different word
71-2_4688.98_22.04.wav_ASR	and i useta have this thing that i would do to to family members and friends which involved involving them in their hospitals they're in their hospitals in their territories
71-2_4711.28_5.98.wav_ASR	and what i would do is i would usually go quiet
71-2_4718.12_0.593.wav_ASR	he'd get up
71-2_4718.88_1.542.wav_ASR	but i would assume myself in the table
71-2_4720.7_0.485.wav_ASR	and i would go
71-2_4721.32_1.92.wav_ASR	and i would talk to the waiters
71-2_4723.38_1.18.wav_ASR	and i would say something like
71-2_4724.78_0.758.wav_ASR	that's my cousin inlaw
71-2_4725.64_1.14.wav_ASR	it's a birthday today
71-2_4727.48_2.1.wav_ASR	he doesn't like any attempt
71-2_4729.698_4.925.wav_ASR	and so is there any point in which you could bring us a cake
71-2_4734.623_3.695.wav_ASR	and then we could really appreciate him by singing really loud and really loud
71-2_4738.31_3.62.wav_ASR	and usually the weather stuff they're always like
71-2_4742.318_0.971.wav_ASR	we didn't love to do that
71-2_4743.298_0.762.wav_ASR	that would be fine
71-2_4744.738_1.792.wav_ASR	so i had this thing about doing that
71-2_4746.63_5.9.wav_ASR	and very often i would bring my own candles the kind that don't blow up
71-2_4752.99_5.848.wav_ASR	so we can really really appreciate everything because then you can really really appreciate people
71-2_4758.97_1.497.wav_ASR	yeah that was my point
71-2_4761.43_2.915.wav_ASR	so it was my cousin's birthday
71-2_4764.86_4.14.wav_ASR	and his relationship with his girlfriend had just ended
71-2_4769.48_3.76.wav_ASR	and he's always kind of quiet and shy
71-2_4774.06_7.648.wav_ASR	so i decided that what we should do is we should call a lot of attention to him because this would be good for him
71-2_4782.483_4.66.wav_ASR	so they were about fifteen of us there in the family
71-2_4787.403_2.28.wav_ASR	we were all sitting in the same seat
71-2_4790.743_1.267.wav_ASR	we went in the same boat
71-2_4792.783_6.78.wav_ASR	but i decided that would actually add to the event if we had people singing from a distance around him
71-2_4800.425_7.26.wav_ASR	oh i i took my niece and nephew with me to talk to the waiting staff
71-2_4808.085_1.875.wav_ASR	and mary was then sick
71-2_4810.545_1.415.wav_ASR	and ella was eight
71-2_4812.62_1.14.wav_ASR	so they came with me
71-2_4813.825_0.36.wav_ASR	and i says
71-2_4814.405_1.486.wav_ASR	that's what we're gonna do to denmark
71-2_4815.905_1.236.wav_ASR	and we're gonna go there
71-2_4817.285_1.99.wav_ASR	we're going to surprise him on his birthday
71-2_4819.275_11.285.wav_ASR	we what we hafta do is is we hafta start to sing at somebody understood that they're gonna hafta start to sing and that they shouldn't know in advance
71-2_4831.135_4.64.wav_ASR	so denmark is over talking to i don't know some other relatives
71-2_4836.42_3.78.wav_ASR	and mary and firstnamee and i are running around talking every day
71-2_4840.48_2.887.wav_ASR	okay now you hafta sing very loud
71-2_4843.64_1.672.wav_ASR	you gotta be very very quiet
71-2_4845.6_1.096.wav_ASR	he had m s
71-2_4847.02_9.14.wav_ASR	so he hears mommy talking to the i think it was his brother probably my other cousin saying
71-2_4856.255_2.8.wav_ASR	now remember to send very very loud
71-2_4859.535_1.02.wav_ASR	they uh uh
71-2_4861.135_1.305.wav_ASR	we're enjoying this whole process
71-2_4864.14_0.78.wav_ASR	and i was just like
71-2_4865.495_0.665.wav_ASR	can i see something
71-2_4866.355_0.48.wav_ASR	and he's crying
71-2_4867.715_1.611.wav_ASR	what are they going to do
71-2_4869.355_1.262.wav_ASR	he knew something was coming
71-2_4871.42_5.18.wav_ASR	but he didn't know about the type of progression that we had put into
71-2_4876.94_5.5.wav_ASR	didn't know about the specific handle that wouldn't bend wouldn't fold out
71-2_4882.7_11.06.wav_ASR	he didn't know that we were gonna get the the iron weight weight weight standard stuff the people who were waiting on the table to bring it
71-2_4894.34_6.12.wav_ASR	and he didn't know that everybody in my family would really enjoy the irony of my family
71-2_4900.46_6.912.wav_ASR	and you know we get very kind of loud when we do things like this
71-2_4907.74_2.645.wav_ASR	so yeah of course they came from behind
71-2_4910.64_5.579.wav_ASR	and i only thought one food service was going to bring the cake
71-2_4917.02_1.8.wav_ASR	and step we had six or so
71-2_4919.0_1.337.wav_ASR	everybody save to come along
71-2_4920.337_2.048.wav_ASR	oh so i gotta be fine
71-2_4922.677_1.435.wav_ASR	it came from behind
71-2_4924.697_6.411.wav_ASR	he could tell that it was coming because everybody in the other side or grinning and looking at him
71-2_4931.777_2.24.wav_ASR	and mary and evy are just left
71-2_4934.457_1.743.wav_ASR	but really hopping around it telling you
71-2_4936.937_0.93.wav_ASR	it's time to say now
71-2_4938.097_0.862.wav_ASR	it's time to sing
71-2_4938.959_2.806.wav_ASR	and he got drenched got drenched
71-2_4941.979_0.74.wav_ASR	he smiled
71-2_4943.099_1.014.wav_ASR	he blew it out
71-2_4944.419_1.009.wav_ASR	came back up again
71-2_4945.559_0.321.wav_ASR	and i says
71-2_4946.139_1.029.wav_ASR	you must be getting old
71-2_4947.999_3.841.wav_ASR	do you at least have the ability to block out the camera
71-2_4951.84_1.08.wav_ASR	can you leave do you
71-2_4953.279_0.841.wav_ASR	and then
71-2_4955.019_0.65.wav_ASR	and i'm all done
71-2_4955.879_0.703.wav_ASR	it's going off
71-2_4956.739_1.861.wav_ASR	and then he's looking at me
71-2_4958.6_2.165.wav_ASR	and he got down and says
71-2_4961.02_4.396.wav_ASR	you know i'm gonna remember this
71-2_4965.96_1.081.wav_ASR	how i'm able to remember them
71-2_4967.18_0.36.wav_ASR	and i says
71-2_4967.76_1.097.wav_ASR	was it a surprise
71-2_4968.88_0.538.wav_ASR	and he says
71-2_4969.54_2.689.wav_ASR	it was not a surprise when i heard matty say
71-2_4972.7_2.78.wav_ASR	remember to send very very loud
71-2_4976.56_11.193.wav_ASR	so i you know i i i think that i you know i i kept her at twenty dollars or something because she cared about so well
71-2_4988.7_0.52.wav_ASR	and she says
71-2_4989.46_1.132.wav_ASR	that was so much fun
71-2_4990.7_0.32.wav_ASR	and she says
71-2_4991.1_1.881.wav_ASR	oh my family is all much fun
71-2_4992.981_3.44.wav_ASR	and and denmark just looked at me it just
71-2_4998.102_3.085.wav_ASR	oh right yeah anyway that was fun
71-2_5001.681_0.427.wav_ASR	and that is
71-2_5016.87_9.94.wav_ASR	back in the days when i would make peanut butter and jelly sandwich because of course i can any more or all sorts of reasons
71-2_5026.95_5.193.wav_ASR	seaport is safety fast and too much shoe and all the rest of it
71-2_5032.23_5.632.wav_ASR	but back in days when i would've done this what i would've done is i would've started out with the bread
71-2_5038.61_13.295.wav_ASR	and i would've toasted it because the test tested it back better for me than it does with unwanted bread and jelly
71-2_5052.65_3.64.wav_ASR	so i would begin by putting it in the toaster
71-2_5056.23_6.16.wav_ASR	and while it's testing up i would pull out the peanut butter and the jelly
71-2_5063.89_6.546.wav_ASR	when the bread comes out of the toaster i would begin with the peanut butter
71-2_5070.71_0.899.wav_ASR	that goes on the bottom
71-2_5071.89_4.232.wav_ASR	what i would do with knife is i would pull out some peanut butter
71-2_5076.47_2.8.wav_ASR	and i would spread it evenly on the bread
71-2_5079.93_2.64.wav_ASR	then i would take the other piece of toast
71-2_5083.17_7.54.wav_ASR	and i would take a spoon and spoon out some jelly
71-2_5091.25_1.174.wav_ASR	they rode it around even
71-2_5093.29_1.54.wav_ASR	and then put the two of them together
71-2_5095.33_3.74.wav_ASR	and probably slice it before a eat it
71-2_5100.37_1.46.wav_ASR	but i don't eat things like that anymore
71-2_5102.25_1.58.wav_ASR	if i did that's how i would do it
71-2_5111.35_0.5.wav_ASR	and okay
71-2_5112.173_4.003.wav_ASR	well i think we talked about this last week
71-2_5116.353_4.662.wav_ASR	and i'm not done my laundry since last week which is why i really needta do it at this point
71-2_5122.17_24.64.wav_ASR	what i'm able to do is not square what i'm able to do is not correct in whole water and wide because i've got to the point that i only buy clothes that can also match better with the item
71-2_5147.64_14.38.wav_ASR	so all of my soul all of my dairy laundry is already put aside because as clothes they end up in my truck
71-2_5163.84_1.68.wav_ASR	so when it's time to do laundry
71-2_5205.68_2.96.wav_ASR	my plan is probably tomorrow after that
71-2_5208.96_5.54.wav_ASR	we have a break between two different points that will allow me to do that
71-2_5214.8_4.46.wav_ASR	what i'm going to do is i pull into the laundry which is on east walt
71-2_5221.0_3.28.wav_ASR	oh i think it's about twenty one hundred block
71-2_5224.612_5.38.wav_ASR	and i will walk into a a medium size washing machine
71-2_5230.452_2.529.wav_ASR	and i will put all of my laundry in
71-2_5233.212_2.606.wav_ASR	we will not separate by color or white
71-2_5236.572_4.435.wav_ASR	we will then add the soap at the top of it
71-2_5241.89_6.96.wav_ASR	then i will put enough cordors to be able to begin the cycle
71-2_5249.67_3.44.wav_ASR	and i will wash on my clothes on two
71-2_5253.83_7.3.wav_ASR	after the cordors are in i push the cold water water
71-2_5261.412_5.86.wav_ASR	and then i take note of the fact that it will take twenty five minutes for it to wash
71-2_5300.51_7.94.wav_ASR	because it's tunnels and sewers that will take longer to to dry
71-2_5309.73_7.36.wav_ASR	and then i throw it all back in the hamper and take it home and then sometimes unfold it or put it away
71-2_5317.17_8.72.wav_ASR	and sometimes i just take right out of the clean hamper and put it in my my my body or whatever i need it
71-2_5335.726_1.6.wav_ASR	and he says
71-2_5338.086_0.904.wav_ASR	well i've never done that
71-2_5339.206_1.26.wav_ASR	and i have tried
71-2_5341.05_1.916.wav_ASR	we'll make very clear that i have tried
71-2_5343.826_8.14.wav_ASR	and have not ever submitted in doing so for different reasons
71-2_5352.99_2.016.wav_ASR	if i wanted to do it correctly
71-2_5355.43_3.92.wav_ASR	and this is what it says on the seed
71-2_5360.33_1.64.wav_ASR	which has never worked for me
71-2_5362.41_2.88.wav_ASR	but this is essentially the way that we would do it
71-2_5365.51_1.04.wav_ASR	and i would get coffee
71-2_5368.81_1.36.wav_ASR	or i would get
71-2_5370.83_2.38.wav_ASR	and i would go to a plant shop
71-2_5374.88_3.677.wav_ASR	and there is one that's about a mile and half where i live
71-2_5378.64_3.28.wav_ASR	and you buy a special type of bread
71-2_5384.1_1.523.wav_ASR	alright it comes in a bag
71-2_5385.8_1.105.wav_ASR	and i think it's it's
71-2_5387.32_6.933.wav_ASR	well i know as it's it's it's further above that you should be able to grow things on it
71-2_5394.253_3.88.wav_ASR	and i would put this into a pot
71-2_5398.493_12.547.wav_ASR	so i would make sure that there was an hold in the water if it's excess water will be able to drain out into a tree
71-2_5412.06_6.94.wav_ASR	put the pot near a window so that there's enough space
71-2_5420.54_3.72.wav_ASR	and what i would do is make sure that the
71-2_5424.56_4.012.wav_ASR	well first i would read the directions on the sheet package which i've done before
71-2_5429.36_2.358.wav_ASR	you hafta go down about two inches
71-2_5431.718_2.05.wav_ASR	you take a seed
71-2_5434.438_1.243.wav_ASR	you passed it
71-2_5436.118_0.689.wav_ASR	you covered
71-2_5437.218_1.782.wav_ASR	you water it
71-2_5439.278_1.558.wav_ASR	and then you leave it alone
71-2_5441.258_2.82.wav_ASR	and supposedly nature takes its course
71-2_5444.438_5.88.wav_ASR	in my particular situation one time i didn't have enough sun
71-2_5451.69_10.26.wav_ASR	another type i simply overwatered it to the point that the soil was so saturated that the seed root
71-2_5463.05_8.069.wav_ASR	and i think the other time it just was too cold in my apartment to be able to sprout in the way that it was supposed to
71-2_5471.119_2.542.wav_ASR	but i've seen other people do it
71-2_5473.819_1.78.wav_ASR	they know the process exists
71-2_5475.839_4.031.wav_ASR	how i've been able to actually do it in a way that makes it actually work
71-2_5480.75_10.703.wav_ASR	so yeah i'm still in the patient state of stage of stage of stage of your process of to do
71-2_5491.453_11.589.wav_ASR	but i haven't yet figured out how to keep the soil dry enough so that it it can sprout without me over watering it to the point that i wrap it
71-2_5503.85_5.443.wav_ASR	so i think there's a balance i have to adjust to be able to do it
84-1_17.07_2.48.wav_ASR	but i would hafta say one of my favorite trips
84-1_19.816_4.091.wav_ASR	my wife and i have two sons that are older now
84-1_24.096_5.94.wav_ASR	and for a number of years we went skiing in ut in parkside
84-1_31.276_2.24.wav_ASR	and i really enjoyed the opportunity
84-1_33.838_6.2.wav_ASR	so my husband was probably about three years old and my oldest was probably
84-1_40.738_1.181.wav_ASR	oh it was probably a little later
84-1_42.198_2.46.wav_ASR	we like five and six
84-1_45.878_4.42.wav_ASR	and i was so much fun to get out there and and stay
84-1_50.529_3.88.wav_ASR	but i i could scare already but my two kids
84-1_55.149_1.45.wav_ASR	my wife scared a little bit
84-1_56.809_3.24.wav_ASR	my two kids became pretty good skiers
84-1_60.329_3.354.wav_ASR	and i am pretty sure that a lot of them was
84-1_63.693_8.407.wav_ASR	we had a ride when we were in in in in
84-1_72.333_1.915.wav_ASR	they just lost the name of a place
84-1_74.633_3.58.wav_ASR	and when we were in europe
84-1_78.653_2.88.wav_ASR	and we went with him for a number of years
84-1_81.538_1.66.wav_ASR	he did a really good job
84-1_83.198_9.633.wav_ASR	how i hope that will give you a little bit of sense of how much i enjoyed my kids and number two how much i enjoyed screaming with them while when i could
84-1_100.218_1.397.wav_ASR	and it was very nice
84-1_127.149_12.52.wav_ASR	well i just got upset to be part of the bar again in philadelphia
84-1_141.089_3.08.wav_ASR	and i would say my my skills
84-1_144.711_5.549.wav_ASR	my skills are pretty good
84-1_150.311_2.822.wav_ASR	they're never gonna be great as they once were
84-1_153.811_8.199.wav_ASR	so i would say on a scale of one to ten right now i would say i'm probably a sick
84-1_162.21_3.04.wav_ASR	so i feel like i'm made a lot of progress
84-1_165.81_5.761.wav_ASR	but i know that there's more progress i need to make especially with with big words
84-1_172.07_1.91.wav_ASR	big words can be difficult for me
84-1_174.17_3.53.wav_ASR	so i do see a speech therapist once a week
84-1_177.77_3.733.wav_ASR	and she's been extremely excited for me
84-1_181.503_0.887.wav_ASR	and i like her
84-1_182.39_6.734.wav_ASR	and i also have some some work out me
84-1_189.203_1.429.wav_ASR	the two of them are just great
84-1_196.9_1.27.wav_ASR	oh i remember that pretty well
84-1_207.12_2.95.wav_ASR	well my wife was away for the weekend
84-1_210.39_2.78.wav_ASR	we had a house in oxford mary
84-1_214.15_3.64.wav_ASR	and i remember that weekend because i hadta work
84-1_217.968_4.82.wav_ASR	and i thought the biggest thing we could do for the weekend was to stay home
84-1_223.738_8.03.wav_ASR	so i think she probably went down there on maybe wednesday or thirties
84-1_232.508_2.66.wav_ASR	and i came home from work on friday
84-1_236.128_0.848.wav_ASR	and i had dinner
84-1_236.976_0.998.wav_ASR	and i did some work
84-1_238.176_2.0.wav_ASR	and i get up the next morning
84-1_240.536_5.24.wav_ASR	so that was the thirty thirty eight
84-1_247.676_1.721.wav_ASR	and i felt pretty good
84-1_249.716_1.188.wav_ASR	and i went about my day
84-1_251.576_2.08.wav_ASR	and i went out for a bicycle ride
84-1_254.296_1.0.wav_ASR	and i came home
84-1_255.22_20.6.wav_ASR	and that night was the night that it was a week or a week maybe after flood was killed in in minnesota
84-1_276.504_5.66.wav_ASR	and so on saturday night i went to bed a little bit early
84-1_282.524_4.46.wav_ASR	well i i thought there might be some bile
84-1_287.724_3.66.wav_ASR	and i also thought it would be helpful in the mornings
84-1_291.464_1.784.wav_ASR	so i could clean up a little bit
84-1_293.7_2.69.wav_ASR	so we live in a fairly nice area
84-1_297.14_2.43.wav_ASR	and i went to bed around ten thirty
84-1_300.6_5.7.wav_ASR	and that night saturday night there was a lot of violence in indiana city hall
84-1_307.16_3.84.wav_ASR	and i remember that that a building was built
84-1_315.929_2.242.wav_ASR	and so i got up
84-1_318.529_2.98.wav_ASR	hey i i live in fairly short place
84-1_322.129_4.884.wav_ASR	and the next morning i got up really early and went outside
84-1_327.229_1.08.wav_ASR	it was a total mess
84-1_329.189_1.324.wav_ASR	so i started cleaning up
84-1_331.129_3.4.wav_ASR	and sometimes during the day i felt a little bit thirsty
84-1_334.969_1.819.wav_ASR	so i went back home
84-1_337.0_1.019.wav_ASR	and i rested for a little
84-1_338.309_1.26.wav_ASR	and went out got a paper
84-1_340.069_2.184.wav_ASR	and then i felt pretty good for the rest of the day
84-1_342.769_10.717.wav_ASR	and sometimes on this sunday night between may thirtieth and august i mean in june first i had my stroke
84-1_354.11_3.04.wav_ASR	and in the morning my wife could not get hold of me
84-1_357.75_1.397.wav_ASR	so we had a door man here
84-1_359.39_0.831.wav_ASR	and he went up
84-1_360.85_1.3.wav_ASR	and i was on the floor
84-1_362.37_2.0.wav_ASR	and so he called an ambulance
84-1_364.67_4.58.wav_ASR	my wife was in occupational medicine
84-1_369.477_7.22.wav_ASR	so she was told that i did that that
84-1_377.397_1.08.wav_ASR	don't bother with pronouns
84-1_378.897_3.68.wav_ASR	my wife should come home
84-1_382.428_8.24.wav_ASR	and i have two sons one who's in new york and one who's in san francisco
84-1_391.348_6.86.wav_ASR	and they were told it was probably a good idea for them to come home because i wasn't sure what was gonna happen
84-1_398.267_6.5.wav_ASR	and so i remembered distinctly that i was brought into the emergency room
84-1_405.227_2.72.wav_ASR	and apparently i could not say lot me
84-1_407.987_2.86.wav_ASR	my voice was very garbled
84-1_411.47_14.3.wav_ASR	but by the end of the procedure my wife told me later that she she wasn't sure what kind of shape i'd been
84-1_425.77_14.463.wav_ASR	but by the end of the surgery which was i had a blood vessel i thought the surgeon thought that i thought the surgery thought that i was going to be able to live
84-1_440.31_3.579.wav_ASR	they didn't know how much exactly i'll be able to do
84-1_444.38_6.0.wav_ASR	so i spent about six eight weeks in rehab
84-1_451.21_2.29.wav_ASR	and i came out not sure what i could do
84-1_453.84_4.18.wav_ASR	so today i i feel pretty good about my voice
84-1_458.6_2.9.wav_ASR	but as i said i still feel there's more i could do
84-1_462.06_4.25.wav_ASR	so as i said i think i'm about seventy percent right now
84-1_478.63_9.28.wav_ASR	well i was in the hospital i was in rehab for eight weeks about a place that's about maybe eight blocks from here
84-1_488.29_1.76.wav_ASR	and it was a time when it was covid
84-1_490.47_3.04.wav_ASR	so it wasn't really easy for me to see people
84-1_494.13_3.84.wav_ASR	but one of the people where we live
84-1_498.084_2.28.wav_ASR	because i live in a high story building
84-1_501.2_9.29.wav_ASR	one of the person was maybe the second or third command at firstnamej which is where i went to for my rehab
84-1_511.17_8.41.wav_ASR	and this person who's late they were allowed to get two people into see me at
84-1_520.09_3.903.wav_ASR	oh i i got to see while my two sisters came in
84-1_524.19_2.789.wav_ASR	and my my children came in
84-1_527.21_2.02.wav_ASR	and then my wife came in
84-1_529.33_4.5.wav_ASR	so i had a very good treatment
84-1_534.47_8.45.wav_ASR	and so each day i would have o t p t in speech
84-1_543.73_2.66.wav_ASR	so that was every day except for saturday and sunday
84-1_554.07_3.15.wav_ASR	well what can i do about it
84-1_558.98_2.94.wav_ASR	so i i mean i understood i hadta deal with that
84-1_562.65_2.916.wav_ASR	and i didn't always feel with it but i tried to
84-1_590.17_3.99.wav_ASR	well i hafta tell you i've had a pretty good life until my stroke
84-1_595.73_3.421.wav_ASR	and i would say that one of the best things that happened to me was
84-1_599.151_7.46.wav_ASR	but i was in a progrised at a school called walt disney which is in midtown connecticut
84-1_607.212_12.7.wav_ASR	and when i was there part of this program i spent it so that i hadta spend a semester repaid it so that i hadta spend a semester of
84-1_620.93_9.96.wav_ASR	and during starting in seventh grade through high school i spoke french pretty well
84-1_631.61_7.66.wav_ASR	because i had a teacher in washington who was at the time going out with one of the cup basals people
84-1_639.596_3.36.wav_ASR	and so she was friends
84-1_643.098_1.783.wav_ASR	and she useta talk about that a lot
84-1_645.456_2.323.wav_ASR	and so i took a class from her
84-1_648.376_1.811.wav_ASR	and somehow i did pretty well
84-1_650.376_6.36.wav_ASR	so when i was in the program at west coast
84-1_657.064_3.6.wav_ASR	and i would say one of the happiest ages for me was graduation
84-1_661.59_8.094.wav_ASR	and i i wound up doing pretty well at the school and even though i had gotten in on a waitlist
84-1_670.684_1.52.wav_ASR	and it was really exciting
84-1_672.25_9.12.wav_ASR	my i i knew a bunch of people in my class but i was really close with the class of m s
84-1_681.67_2.875.wav_ASR	and it was just a fun time for me
84-1_684.545_1.765.wav_ASR	yeah i was president of my fraternity
84-1_687.01_6.06.wav_ASR	and i i met someone who became one of my closest friends
84-1_693.27_2.1.wav_ASR	he was the proof of wisdom at west orange
84-1_695.55_2.306.wav_ASR	so i it was really nice
84-1_698.38_8.68.wav_ASR	after i graduated from high college i spent some vacation with him and some of my roommates
84-1_707.68_2.16.wav_ASR	he he was someone who was responsible
84-1_710.58_2.476.wav_ASR	he went to haverhill hospital
84-1_713.273_5.48.wav_ASR	and at the end of his freshman year he went down he one the move coordinator
84-1_719.733_2.72.wav_ASR	and he went down to the bookstore
84-1_722.973_3.56.wav_ASR	and he bought all books about italian restaurants
84-1_726.863_7.22.wav_ASR	so he went back to go back to campus and he changed
84-1_734.443_1.76.wav_ASR	he was already inside of school
84-1_736.563_2.08.wav_ASR	he'd been under graduated at prince university
84-1_739.263_4.24.wav_ASR	and he after his first year of winning the moot court he said
84-1_743.663_0.992.wav_ASR	it wasn't for me
84-1_744.8_5.82.wav_ASR	and he went to at a program in atlanta atlanta alaska
84-1_756.57_3.48.wav_ASR	yeah i it was a good place for me
84-1_764.754_4.32.wav_ASR	and i haven't been visiting since my stroke
84-1_769.655_5.279.wav_ASR	but i useta be you know i useta be fairly infrequent at the university
84-1_775.834_6.1.wav_ASR	and my youngest son went there after spending a year in school
84-1_782.807_7.94.wav_ASR	and he he did really well at the school
84-1_790.907_3.04.wav_ASR	so i was very excited for him
84-1_828.61_2.67.wav_ASR	well i happen to know these pictures quite well
84-1_832.07_3.18.wav_ASR	it's a story about a kid playing soccer
84-1_836.05_3.3.wav_ASR	and he he he he strikes the ball
84-1_839.99_3.52.wav_ASR	and went through the window of a nearby house
84-1_843.796_24.848.wav_ASR	and landed inside the house where it was taken by one of the young or middle age husband or maybe husband or just a regular person who lived in the house
84-1_868.644_20.254.wav_ASR	and then he looked out the window to see if he could hit the soccer ball so that landed on his not in his not his lap but on his side
84-1_907.89_1.94.wav_ASR	but this one i love
84-1_909.988_8.342.wav_ASR	it's about a young boy who when he went to school he was deciding whether or not to take an umbrella
84-1_918.59_2.6.wav_ASR	he decided not to take the umbrella
84-1_921.69_2.48.wav_ASR	and it turned out that it it started raining
84-1_924.87_1.88.wav_ASR	so he went back home
84-1_926.94_1.818.wav_ASR	and he was soaking wet
84-1_929.34_2.127.wav_ASR	but apparently he changed his clothes
84-1_932.02_5.76.wav_ASR	and he went back outside with a umbrella so that he could get to school
84-1_938.24_6.041.wav_ASR	and i assume he went to school on time but i really don't know whether that's part of the story or not
84-1_957.58_7.15.wav_ASR	so this is a little girl maybe under ten who had a cat who was stuck up in a tree
84-1_965.45_7.58.wav_ASR	so apparently the the dad got off his god a ladder
84-1_973.283_3.967.wav_ASR	but girl was on tricycle
84-1_977.59_1.904.wav_ASR	and he stopped and looked at the cat
84-1_979.94_19.956.wav_ASR	so the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the mother went up to get the the the the the the the the the
84-1_999.896_13.754.wav_ASR	and i guess the the ladder got kicked away so that the the husband was stuck up there with the cat
84-1_1014.556_2.6.wav_ASR	and the the dog started barking
84-1_1017.78_2.68.wav_ASR	and eventually the fire department came
84-1_1021.24_0.94.wav_ASR	and they were able
84-1_1022.44_0.5.wav_ASR	and i assume
84-1_1023.32_0.654.wav_ASR	and i don't know
84-1_1024.06_3.563.wav_ASR	but i think they were able to get the cat and get the man down
84-1_1188.54_7.06.wav_ASR	so this is a story about a young woman named cinderella
84-1_1196.189_19.982.wav_ASR	and she was working at a place where there was a a little age lady and two people who had grown up with her and were interested in trying to get someone to marry them
84-1_1216.59_15.38.wav_ASR	so it turned out that there was a young prince who was infested with her with his family
84-1_1232.85_29.52.wav_ASR	and the young prince decided that they should get together and have a ball so that maybe if the people the people of the community the girls were properly interested in having a realization with the prince
84-1_1263.48_2.52.wav_ASR	he don't remember the name of the prince
84-1_1266.09_4.89.wav_ASR	but so they sent her out an invitation to all the people in the community
84-1_1272.04_9.98.wav_ASR	and the two young ladies who lived with her who lived with her
84-1_1284.38_8.84.wav_ASR	her older mother decided that they would go to the ball and start to go to the ball
84-1_1293.98_17.52.wav_ASR	but cinderella who was like a carriage on the property and was stuck doing things washing clothes and cleaning the floor and stuff like that she found out about their being this
84-1_1312.413_4.54.wav_ASR	and she wanted to know if there was some way she could attend
84-1_1317.593_1.78.wav_ASR	so she says
84-1_1320.333_2.28.wav_ASR	don't remember exactly how it happened
84-1_1323.133_6.02.wav_ASR	and she was able to get into touch with somebody i think they call the fairy godmother
84-1_1330.065_3.52.wav_ASR	and she talked to the fairy godmother
84-1_1334.45_20.985.wav_ASR	and so while the two people from from the house were going with her her her her older lady to the dance she decided that she could go
84-1_1355.435_4.2.wav_ASR	so she got dressed up in fancy clothes
84-1_1360.415_5.337.wav_ASR	and she was told by the fairy godmother that she could go to the ball
84-1_1365.795_1.72.wav_ASR	but she had only one right quote
84-1_1368.295_2.94.wav_ASR	and that is that she would be back by midnight
84-1_1371.407_11.811.wav_ASR	so she went to the ball and fell in love with the prince with the prince
84-1_1383.218_12.28.wav_ASR	but when the clock struck struck struck midnight cinderella knew that she hadta get out of there
84-1_1396.098_5.08.wav_ASR	so she raced for the door and down the steps and into the carriage
84-1_1401.35_2.26.wav_ASR	but soon the carriage
84-1_1404.69_9.9.wav_ASR	and she was by herself with i think some people who may have been rags and other members of the community
84-1_1415.23_19.09.wav_ASR	so she she found out that the young prince was looking for the the young lady who had disappeared disappeared at midnight
84-1_1434.84_11.51.wav_ASR	and he sent out a i guess somebody of plea or something that if the person was around she should please contact him
84-1_1446.76_12.16.wav_ASR	and when that didn't happen then a young man went around the city to see if by chance anybody knew anything about this young girl
84-1_1459.92_3.1.wav_ASR	and when she went to the house that had the tube
84-1_1463.595_2.1.wav_ASR	but guess you might by now call them something
84-1_1468.04_9.89.wav_ASR	and she i think some how got a hole of cinderella who maybe washing clothes in the basement or something
84-1_1478.88_7.897.wav_ASR	and when she was brought up stairs the one shoe that had been left behind she tried on that one shoe
84-1_1486.777_13.623.wav_ASR	and it fit her so that it she knew that the that young prince was going to attend to this young lady
84-1_1501.077_2.06.wav_ASR	and so they got back together
84-1_1503.537_1.94.wav_ASR	and eventually they got married
84-1_1550.75_3.76.wav_ASR	we never really had a lot of experience with clocks
84-1_1555.47_3.2.wav_ASR	it was pretty much always on time
84-1_1559.37_10.68.wav_ASR	and when i was growing up particularly when i was in high school there were some reason why i hadta get home
84-1_1570.61_8.74.wav_ASR	so you know i went to a lot of parties on friday night in saturday night and come home when i wanted
84-1_1579.38_20.6.wav_ASR	and i think it was in large part because my two social workers decided that he that two of them really hadta teach me how to be comfortable with myself and then to be able to know when i was out too safe
84-1_1600.084_3.495.wav_ASR	so i mean there were few times when i was outta late
84-1_1604.124_2.309.wav_ASR	but nothing really happened to me
84-1_1606.924_3.866.wav_ASR	and then when i went to college i would come home through the summer
84-1_1611.804_6.56.wav_ASR	and i remember that i was involved with a couple of young ladies
84-1_1618.528_4.623.wav_ASR	but i would go out when i couldn't get home when i wanted to
84-1_1623.52_6.58.wav_ASR	and i remember one summer i had a job that required me to be at work at six o'clock in the morning
84-1_1630.928_3.42.wav_ASR	so sometimes during the summer i would stay at home and go to work
84-1_1645.61_7.485.wav_ASR	well so i worked a lot properly when i hadta be
84-1_1653.47_2.186.wav_ASR	thank i've told you this one
84-1_1655.73_0.463.wav_ASR	and i should
84-1_1656.193_3.42.wav_ASR	but i worked for a french company for them
84-1_1660.878_8.049.wav_ASR	and i when i had my stroke i started thinking about things i could do
84-1_1668.927_8.2.wav_ASR	because because really between vacations and between a lot of time i spent particularly with my children
84-1_1678.067_2.92.wav_ASR	they were in a town in new jersey called priscilla
84-1_1681.727_2.08.wav_ASR	and they both played a lot of hockey
84-1_1684.367_2.89.wav_ASR	so i never really had a lot of time
84-1_1687.246_2.783.wav_ASR	but one thing i've decided i'm considering to do
84-1_1690.506_4.76.wav_ASR	with in the next year we're gonna be moving a little further south
84-1_1695.886_3.08.wav_ASR	and i really thought that one thing i could do was burrow
84-1_1699.586_2.933.wav_ASR	because i've always had an interest in that
84-1_1702.606_1.984.wav_ASR	but i've never really focused on that
84-1_1705.086_1.62.wav_ASR	and i really thought incorrectly
84-1_1706.856_2.9.wav_ASR	now i ride a three real bicycle
84-1_1709.936_4.506.wav_ASR	but i can't ride a bicycle like i useta do
84-1_1714.521_16.081.wav_ASR	so i'm really hoping that we move about birds and maybe come something of an interest in in bird watching because i think that would be a good thing for me to do
84-1_1736.76_2.52.wav_ASR	so so did she live in bloomington
84-1_1760.0_20.64.wav_ASR	well i guess when i started traveling for this front company when i started the program when i started the program casket
84-1_1780.938_3.5.wav_ASR	but they quickly figured out that i could speak
84-1_1785.098_1.94.wav_ASR	so the lawyers were in front
84-1_1787.898_2.948.wav_ASR	and i was one of the few girls outside of friends
84-1_1791.078_1.06.wav_ASR	and i was in the united states
84-1_1793.658_4.48.wav_ASR	so they useta send me to various places
84-1_1798.398_5.96.wav_ASR	and i remember that i stayed in a real nice hotel in
84-1_1805.978_2.42.wav_ASR	and i also stayed in a nice hotel
84-1_1809.158_3.84.wav_ASR	when a a nice hotel when i went to chicago
84-1_1813.177_5.8.wav_ASR	and i also was in a nice hotel when i was in
84-1_1822.457_6.54.wav_ASR	so i i and during one of the times i was there and it was the fourth of july
84-1_1829.537_3.16.wav_ASR	so i remember that the stepbroat brought me a little cake
84-1_1833.15_7.12.wav_ASR	so i i i don't really need a big hole all though my wife likes something
84-1_1841.05_10.3.wav_ASR	oh i always thought i was in places that i could be comfortable even when even when
84-1_1851.626_2.28.wav_ASR	he i do remember saying in one o'clock
84-1_1854.01_5.896.wav_ASR	and i was in bermom for to be part of a case that was pending
84-1_1860.446_2.235.wav_ASR	and we stayed in a god awful hotel
84-1_1862.726_3.066.wav_ASR	even even that turned out to be good for me
84-1_1865.941_11.7.wav_ASR	so it was a good way for me to learn about the way different hotels can treat me different
84-1_1878.421_3.38.wav_ASR	yeah i was in a hotel in a bed part of town and bedroom
84-1_1882.0_1.381.wav_ASR	remember that pretty well
84-1_1897.088_7.408.wav_ASR	well when i was in college there was this person
84-1_1904.816_0.654.wav_ASR	thank you
84-1_1905.47_0.58.wav_ASR	the proof came
84-1_1906.59_6.9.wav_ASR	and over the he was there for about about thirty thirty five years
84-1_1913.91_2.92.wav_ASR	and in nineteen ninety nine he died
84-1_1917.85_5.54.wav_ASR	but before that time she and a group of people
84-1_1923.607_16.1.wav_ASR	there was one person from the class of sixty five one person from the class of seventy nine which was me and a couple people from the class of eighty
84-1_1939.914_5.6.wav_ASR	the three of us became very good friends
84-1_1945.874_9.776.wav_ASR	and every year because willy did not have any any friends
84-1_1955.75_8.1.wav_ASR	he had a child who died when when he was six or seven years old
84-1_1964.11_8.96.wav_ASR	and so one thing he useta do once a quarter from covid he useta go down to new york
84-1_1973.501_5.94.wav_ASR	and we we we would we would i went for my graduation
84-1_1979.861_3.68.wav_ASR	and i went for every year after for about twenty five years
84-1_1983.921_5.12.wav_ASR	and i went to a place that's no longer in existence but it's called new town
84-1_1989.678_3.6.wav_ASR	and it was a very nice day
84-1_1994.718_3.712.wav_ASR	and we just had a wonderful time every year i was there
84-1_1998.43_14.51.wav_ASR	so i really think back upon that a lot and remember just how much fun i had with these people and how much how much i still kept in contact with them
84-1_2012.94_5.74.wav_ASR	and so these these people are some very well known people
84-1_2019.2_6.8.wav_ASR	so i've already had one of the whites has already died
84-1_2026.88_4.22.wav_ASR	he was the head of this thing called the the
84-1_2031.651_17.0.wav_ASR	it's a big it's a big work for a family
84-1_2048.851_0.828.wav_ASR	and i forgot the name
84-1_2049.811_1.4.wav_ASR	they have a huge trust
84-1_2051.568_3.28.wav_ASR	and so he's gonna retire and move back to new york
84-1_2055.648_10.086.wav_ASR	so i'm very excited that at the end of september i'm gonna be meeting with them in these people who go back to the clinic sixty two
84-1_2066.128_2.086.wav_ASR	so i'm i'm looking forward to it

84-1_2077.677_3.26.wav_ASR	they all know i had a stroke
84-1_2081.677_3.36.wav_ASR	but i i'm really looking for her
84-1_2085.17_5.06.wav_ASR	most days some days i think that maybe i should go because i'm not far enough long
84-1_2090.73_1.56.wav_ASR	but it's it
84-1_2093.19_1.8.wav_ASR	can't remember what we were talking about
84-1_2100.86_4.44.wav_ASR	so so so we went to this very nice restaurant
84-1_2105.464_2.296.wav_ASR	we did it for about twenty or thirty five years
84-1_2108.22_5.907.wav_ASR	and it was a quick place for me and for the other people that were in the group
84-1_2114.08_11.39.wav_ASR	we useta do it every year in december because it was near the time when one of our favorite people from the class of sixty two had a birthday
84-1_2132.16_4.04.wav_ASR	it was a french restaurant called lobster tail
84-1_2137.66_14.62.wav_ASR	yeah if you go back to the nineteen seventies and eighties and look up the restaurant it's a twenty nine west tirtiennes street
84-1_2152.28_7.02.wav_ASR	you know it's in a in a nice old building that has three or four floors
84-1_2159.56_1.7.wav_ASR	and it was exciting
84-1_2161.495_22.32.wav_ASR	and because we knew he knew the stepchild would go there three or four or they knew he knew the stepdaughter it was just fantastic really well so that when we came here for the birthday party it was just fantastic
84-1_2184.085_1.14.wav_ASR	it was really nice
84-1_2189.53_1.988.wav_ASR	it's not there anymore yeah
84-1_2191.525_0.84.wav_ASR	it was so
84-1_2192.725_1.984.wav_ASR	there was an owner in his wife
84-1_2195.385_3.86.wav_ASR	and i think they ultimately you know was
84-1_2199.985_8.94.wav_ASR	and they sold the restaurant to a guy who was i think from either crunch or from germany
84-1_2210.365_2.624.wav_ASR	and he did not do a very good job
84-1_2212.939_7.3.wav_ASR	so i would say after three or four years it it didn't exist anymore
84-1_2224.89_2.489.wav_ASR	so we're so we're going to
84-1_2228.519_2.26.wav_ASR	so the fellow who was there
84-1_2231.118_5.52.wav_ASR	and i wish i could remember the name of the place that he was involved in my accident
84-1_2237.538_4.0.wav_ASR	but he he has one son who's got three wonderful children
84-1_2242.058_2.84.wav_ASR	and they live in north carolina
84-1_2245.216_14.64.wav_ASR	so my my friend who's now widowed is has has fixed up a place i think in new york
84-1_2260.677_6.594.wav_ASR	so i know that's where the parties gonna be because the apartment is apparently finished now
84-1_2267.297_1.81.wav_ASR	he's been working on it for a couple years
84-1_2290.78_3.59.wav_ASR	oh interesting enough i had one for lunch
84-1_2296.1_4.56.wav_ASR	he i like it once in a while
84-1_2300.734_16.34.wav_ASR	one of the people who was in who one of the people who's part of group is a fellow who's part of the group of sixty five or sixty six
84-1_2317.101_4.2.wav_ASR	and he has a peanut butter and jelly sandwich every day for lunch
84-1_2321.761_2.78.wav_ASR	well what you do as you take two pieces of bread
84-1_2325.321_9.159.wav_ASR	my bread i have my bread in the freezer because i only use a certain amount of it every day
84-1_2335.061_1.789.wav_ASR	so i take the pieces of bread out
84-1_2336.89_7.96.wav_ASR	they they come to room temperature
84-1_2347.07_2.92.wav_ASR	then i have a special peanut butter that i use
84-1_2350.01_1.08.wav_ASR	they lived to cash in
84-1_2353.6_1.85.wav_ASR	well the peanut butter there is natural
84-1_2356.05_2.9.wav_ASR	so that's the peanut butter i buy
84-1_2359.35_3.68.wav_ASR	and i would we have a few jars of that around
84-1_2363.63_3.48.wav_ASR	so i would open the jar take some peanut butter
84-1_2367.83_2.504.wav_ASR	and then i would take different kinds of jelly
84-1_2370.434_9.058.wav_ASR	but right now i'm on a kick where i have it's like blue blue strawberry strawberry and raspberry together in a mix
84-1_2380.014_1.86.wav_ASR	and i put that on the sandwich
84-1_2382.514_2.34.wav_ASR	then i close the sandwich
84-1_2385.454_3.553.wav_ASR	and you can either cut it in half or leave it whole
84-1_2389.007_2.9.wav_ASR	and for some stupid reason i always leave it whole
84-1_2392.387_1.62.wav_ASR	and i had what was a nice sandwich
84-1_2394.347_5.34.wav_ASR	so so i had that about one thirty as i was performing for my two o'clock call
84-1_2413.71_5.31.wav_ASR	well water is something i still try to do but i think my wife probably does more of it
84-1_2420.092_4.906.wav_ASR	so i would choose what kind of temperature i would want it
84-1_2424.998_6.36.wav_ASR	but technically i would choose cold water because most of the stuff i need to watch is cold water
84-1_2431.958_3.042.wav_ASR	so i would in the special we have a machine
84-1_2435.278_2.14.wav_ASR	so we live in the apartment
84-1_2437.656_7.8.wav_ASR	and we lived in an area that useta be that was where we hafta buy the condo
84-1_2446.076_9.42.wav_ASR	but because we were getting ready to move next year we sold our condo in the same building
84-1_2455.617_4.36.wav_ASR	so we would get the water soap
84-1_2461.32_13.017.wav_ASR	we once the water set it it it comes out on the side
84-1_2474.39_1.33.wav_ASR	so there's nothing on the top
84-1_2476.55_1.89.wav_ASR	so we hafta load the washer
84-1_2479.39_8.06.wav_ASR	and then we put the laundry detergent in it and start it right
84-1_2487.48_6.74.wav_ASR	and you could see it from the we could see it from the
84-1_2495.135_8.325.wav_ASR	and not something that it's something that is easily to see from the floor
84-1_2504.52_2.52.wav_ASR	and so we put it on why
84-1_2507.302_4.58.wav_ASR	and usually last for some reason for an hour and five minutes
84-1_2512.062_3.808.wav_ASR	but after an hour and five minutes the wash is done
84-1_2515.962_6.0.wav_ASR	and if we have particular clothes that needta put it on a line we would typically put it on the line
84-1_2522.162_4.18.wav_ASR	and the rest of it would go into the dryer where it would dry
84-1_2526.352_8.24.wav_ASR	and then it would be ready to be folded and put in the cup of dryers that we use for laundry
84-1_2535.332_2.932.wav_ASR	my wife has quite a few more than i do
84-1_2538.264_8.158.wav_ASR	but it's a place where we can put our stuff and use it as we need to
84-1_2557.42_3.87.wav_ASR	well you hafta understand that now i have it taken me a while
84-1_2562.42_5.82.wav_ASR	so i usually get up in the morning
84-1_2568.47_8.6.wav_ASR	and i will put on my underwear
84-1_2578.86_3.09.wav_ASR	and then i would put on my shirt
84-1_2583.37_2.06.wav_ASR	and i would put on my socks
84-1_2586.38_6.68.wav_ASR	and then i would lie in bed for a little bit and do some exercise because exercise is very important to me
84-1_2593.52_9.62.wav_ASR	especially even though i'm near more than three years out it's still important for me to get some exercise in every day
84-1_2603.74_0.96.wav_ASR	so i do that
84-1_2604.776_5.64.wav_ASR	and then i will treat once that is done i'll turn on the tv
84-1_2610.876_6.2.wav_ASR	and i'll get dressed the rest of my way which includes you know my socks
84-1_2617.536_4.7.wav_ASR	and you haven't seen this but i wear a brace on my right foot
84-1_2622.416_1.873.wav_ASR	so i put that on as well
84-1_2624.77_4.28.wav_ASR	and i i started my day
84-2_12.09_1.1.wav_ASR	my favorite holiday
84-2_13.79_9.28.wav_ASR	it's easily thanksgiving because i have a very small family but usually the family comes as well as my two sons
84-2_24.03_1.468.wav_ASR	and now one of them's married
84-2_25.77_2.32.wav_ASR	and the other guy's gonna be married pretty soon
84-2_28.25_4.26.wav_ASR	so i looked forward to a table with food more people
84-2_32.564_2.32.wav_ASR	oh i have two sisters
84-2_35.624_2.44.wav_ASR	one of them who is i think i told you in new york
84-2_38.244_1.46.wav_ASR	one of them who lives in chicago
84-2_40.424_2.76.wav_ASR	so they taply come
84-2_43.573_14.028.wav_ASR	and for many many years i had my stroke i was in charge of the cooking of the turkey which i do on a grill
84-2_58.053_1.58.wav_ASR	so it's really really nice
84-2_60.413_2.52.wav_ASR	now i don't do it on the grid anymore
84-2_63.47_4.5.wav_ASR	and we hafta have that house at the shore but we don't have that anymore
84-2_68.71_4.28.wav_ASR	so i somebody else cooked it in the oven
84-2_78.94_7.65.wav_ASR	well i've been the host for thanksgiving since my mother died in nineteen ninety
84-2_86.96_1.04.wav_ASR	so it's been a while
84-2_92.66_0.372.wav_ASR	it is
84-2_93.22_2.6.wav_ASR	it's nice but it doesn't last forever
84-2_100.512_2.1.wav_ASR	we celebrated halloween
84-2_103.112_6.44.wav_ASR	so we we we don't even give pressure anymore
84-2_109.668_11.36.wav_ASR	unfortunately both of the young ladies that my two sons married are both not guests
84-2_121.788_3.708.wav_ASR	one of them i think has no relation which is fine with me
84-2_125.777_3.18.wav_ASR	and one of them i think is basically
84-2_130.297_4.6.wav_ASR	but i think she likes cinderella as well
84-2_154.92_3.84.wav_ASR	my speech is probably the thing that i'm working on the most
84-2_159.16_7.84.wav_ASR	as you know i useta be a lawyer and i've just gone back on account of duty
84-2_167.46_3.07.wav_ASR	so i can still be alive if i wanna be alive
84-2_171.22_15.68.wav_ASR	but i i feel that a lot of times especially with small words and proons and proons and right i'm still in right with his and proons and right i'm not graduate with small words
84-2_187.36_3.34.wav_ASR	so that that that i hafta think for a while
84-2_190.722_2.64.wav_ASR	especially now that laura does mop
84-2_193.622_1.4.wav_ASR	and there was all the drudges all the drudges
84-2_195.302_2.954.wav_ASR	and i hafta remember which which is left in which is right
84-2_198.782_1.54.wav_ASR	that includes me some times
84-2_200.742_3.33.wav_ASR	and i'm i'm pretty good about back and forth
84-2_204.582_2.796.wav_ASR	and i'm hoping that i'll be able to drive at some point
84-2_207.378_8.784.wav_ASR	and not that i really wanted to drive because i've never been properly instructed in driving
84-2_216.44_9.7.wav_ASR	they just do it because my wife sits in the other seat and my my two kids when they were around something they would always sit in the backseat
84-2_227.22_6.2.wav_ASR	but now since my stroke my wife does all the driving
84-2_234.05_6.33.wav_ASR	and as i say i think maybe in a year or so i might be able to start driving again
84-2_240.74_0.76.wav_ASR	and i'm not sure
84-2_247.16_2.58.wav_ASR	don't tell my wife that you said
84-2_257.54_0.74.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
84-2_263.0_2.98.wav_ASR	oh yeah i remember my stroke pretty well
84-2_273.18_11.211.wav_ASR	well i was in the hospital for about eight days before i went to the rehab program which is also connected to tom hilton hospital
84-2_285.39_20.682.wav_ASR	and that's where in my area of town which is near right now instead of going up to penn which is properly about maybe ten blocks from here we go down to firstnamej which is probably about maybe ten blocks from here we go down to firstnamej
84-2_306.65_15.44.wav_ASR	and i remember you that on sunday morning i went out to get and i went out because there was a riot the night before from the guy up in minnesota
84-2_322.53_1.5.wav_ASR	if i get his name right now
84-2_324.03_2.88.wav_ASR	so there's a huge ride
84-2_327.03_2.723.wav_ASR	we had a building actually built here
84-2_330.29_4.617.wav_ASR	and i went out at about six o'clock in the morning to start cleaning up
84-2_335.07_2.209.wav_ASR	and i was one of the few people out there
84-2_337.63_2.1.wav_ASR	and i remember they're being a ton of clown up
84-2_339.843_5.105.wav_ASR	and so i was there from about six to nine o'clock in the morning
84-2_345.103_1.957.wav_ASR	and then i went to a new patient
84-2_347.387_0.994.wav_ASR	they didn't feel great
84-2_348.683_2.769.wav_ASR	so i light loaded down for a little bit
84-2_351.763_2.48.wav_ASR	and then i went to work in the afternoon
84-2_354.303_6.287.wav_ASR	and by the evening i was starting to feel a little worse but not temporarily worse
84-2_361.05_2.15.wav_ASR	and i went to bed around ten thirty
84-2_364.003_2.577.wav_ASR	and i had my stroke in the middle of the night
84-2_367.183_3.063.wav_ASR	and in the morning my wife could not get hold of me
84-2_370.723_2.645.wav_ASR	so we have a concierge who came up in front me
84-2_373.648_1.7.wav_ASR	and they took me to the hospital
84-2_375.668_2.58.wav_ASR	and that's when i spent about eight days in the hospital
84-2_378.928_4.34.wav_ASR	because because i was during covid
84-2_383.468_2.537.wav_ASR	so i really didn't see anybody there
84-2_386.828_5.56.wav_ASR	and i had it was difficult for me because i felt my talking was not great
84-2_392.4_3.057.wav_ASR	and also it was just difficult for me
84-2_395.58_4.82.wav_ASR	so it was i must've watched tv
84-2_400.74_2.02.wav_ASR	and it was in a room by myself
84-2_402.991_12.52.wav_ASR	and eventually on a monday night about a week in a couple days later i went to me which is only about six blocks away
84-2_415.551_0.838.wav_ASR	it was pretty close
84-2_416.971_3.157.wav_ASR	so that's when i stayed for three four months
84-2_430.74_2.047.wav_ASR	oh i've done a lot of things to try to get better
84-2_433.0_1.662.wav_ASR	and i don't know if all that work back
84-2_435.24_3.841.wav_ASR	so i was in the hospital for four eight weeks
84-2_439.239_9.64.wav_ASR	and every day except the weekends i had o t and p t
84-2_449.599_1.36.wav_ASR	and then i also had speech
84-2_451.039_1.499.wav_ASR	and that was typically in the morning
84-2_453.139_4.394.wav_ASR	and then in the afternoon i for a while i didn't do anything
84-2_457.533_3.458.wav_ASR	but then eventually i started going to art
84-2_461.433_4.9.wav_ASR	and i i did some stuff but it wasn't really very good
84-2_467.093_6.865.wav_ASR	and i thought by the time i left there i wasn't so sure i was gonna do it
84-2_474.15_7.18.wav_ASR	so i tried it a little bit more at m g which is where i go for outpatient
84-2_481.83_0.958.wav_ASR	and it wasn't grape
84-2_483.11_2.78.wav_ASR	soon they introduced a music program
84-2_486.65_2.184.wav_ASR	and i was always interested in singing
84-2_489.35_2.38.wav_ASR	but i don't sing a lot
84-2_491.79_3.961.wav_ASR	and i don't sing i'm afraid i don't always sing on key
84-2_496.23_1.816.wav_ASR	so i thought it might be good
84-2_498.25_2.78.wav_ASR	so i took some singing lessons which i still take
84-2_501.63_4.7.wav_ASR	and then overall there's an aphasia problem
84-2_506.586_10.4.wav_ASR	and so there's a singing group there which i think i like better because i get real songs instead of mcds
84-2_517.118_19.5.wav_ASR	and i also i'm on something called ipads and we tried to do stuff to help people learn about aphasia and see see how we can help other people who have aphasia
84-2_563.78_6.71.wav_ASR	well i have a lot of good experiences because i've had a pretty positive life
84-2_570.49_11.14.wav_ASR	and i spent up until first grade i went to school in a september of clivelovelvelovelu clivoli clivoli clivoli clivoli clivoli clivoli clivoli clivoli clivoli clivoli clivoli clivoli clivoli clivoli clivoli clivoli clivoli clivoli clivoli clivoli clivoli clivoli clivoli clivoli clivoli clivoli clivoli clivoli clivoli clivoli clivoli clivoli clivoli clivoli clivoli clivoli clivoli clivoli clivoli clivoli clivoli clivoli clivoli clivoli clivoli clivoli clivoli clivoli clivoli clivoli clivoli clivoli clivoli clivoli clivoli clivoli clivoli clivoli clivoli cliv
84-2_582.166_13.72.wav_ASR	and then between my between my first and second grade years i moved to chicago and was in a really nice neighborhood there called phoenix
84-2_596.144_6.909.wav_ASR	and so growing up by i i was participating in a lot of different things
84-2_603.184_3.92.wav_ASR	and i was not a great athlete but i was an okay enough athlete
84-2_607.264_4.74.wav_ASR	so i usually make the last play on the team
84-2_612.29_4.45.wav_ASR	and i really like playing hockey which we did outside the town
84-2_617.81_12.14.wav_ASR	so so i would say i learned a lot of experience from hacking just about about the game and about you know how to set up different planes
84-2_630.86_17.583.wav_ASR	and ultimately eventually when i was in my what's called the banquet which is fourteen and fifteen i was made captain of the team
84-2_648.56_1.971.wav_ASR	so that was a really nice dinner for me
84-2_650.531_4.636.wav_ASR	and it was a good time for me
84-2_655.371_2.836.wav_ASR	my i was on the b m
84-2_658.411_5.549.wav_ASR	but there's enough places on the b m that i were pretty friendly with
84-2_664.191_1.68.wav_ASR	and all of them were from newark
84-2_666.031_2.66.wav_ASR	so it worked in north carolina
84-2_668.951_1.04.wav_ASR	it was near by myself
84-2_670.145_2.671.wav_ASR	so it was really nice to meet all the people
84-2_673.365_10.54.wav_ASR	and we would have games based basically from lake forest and from lake county to cook lake
84-2_684.865_2.36.wav_ASR	so it was just nice to get to know some people
84-2_693.81_2.2.wav_ASR	and i did get her by as fast as possible
84-2_696.361_5.44.wav_ASR	and i broke my collarbone
84-2_706.07_1.072.wav_ASR	and it wasn't that bad
84-2_710.85_1.037.wav_ASR	it it can be
84-2_712.13_2.397.wav_ASR	but it wasn't bad for me
84-2_714.67_2.22.wav_ASR	maybe it wasn't a properly bad you know
84-2_717.63_4.6.wav_ASR	but i remember i came home and i still wasn't feeling great
84-2_722.231_11.86.wav_ASR	so my dad took me to what was then called firstnameev hospital which is now part of northwestern medical center from downtown
84-2_735.0_4.82.wav_ASR	and so i remember i did some exercise and some other things
84-2_740.071_1.66.wav_ASR	and they said i had a broken collar
84-2_741.98_7.66.wav_ASR	so i i i think you know i i actually broke my collarbone
84-2_751.48_1.24.wav_ASR	maybe it was only once
84-2_753.1_1.699.wav_ASR	and then i also broke my wrist
84-2_755.56_1.969.wav_ASR	but i can't remember exactly how he did that
84-2_765.892_4.149.wav_ASR	yeah you you can have a castle on that e
84-2_776.028_1.013.wav_ASR	thank you for that
84-2_777.152_1.08.wav_ASR	you hadta force it
84-2_781.243_1.08.wav_ASR	alright
84-2_785.063_2.76.wav_ASR	and so did you do that in college too
84-2_797.763_0.72.wav_ASR	oh good
84-2_845.89_2.26.wav_ASR	oh yes that's the same thing we saw last time
84-2_858.01_2.94.wav_ASR	so it's a story of a young man
84-2_861.0_5.48.wav_ASR	so he's around twelve years old kicking a soccer ball
84-2_867.26_13.14.wav_ASR	and i guess one of the error kicks went through a plate glass window and landed next to someone who was probably either eating tea
84-2_880.69_3.33.wav_ASR	and so he saw the ball coming at him
84-2_884.43_10.34.wav_ASR	and he nose that a lamp had come to rest underneath him
84-2_895.09_3.248.wav_ASR	and i could see the ball coming at him
84-2_898.338_2.865.wav_ASR	so he might have caught the ball
84-2_902.03_2.001.wav_ASR	and then he wasn't sure what to do
84-2_904.138_2.02.wav_ASR	so he saw that the glass was broken
84-2_906.678_4.26.wav_ASR	so we went over to the window to see what had happened
84-2_911.418_4.592.wav_ASR	and i'm assuming that he saw the person who kicked the soccer ball
84-2_916.01_6.4.wav_ASR	but then perhaps the person with the soccer ball had run away
84-2_930.177_7.24.wav_ASR	so it's the story of a young boy who was on his way to school
84-2_938.237_5.22.wav_ASR	and he wasn't sure that he needed an umbrella
84-2_943.61_7.119.wav_ASR	so he decided that he wouldn't take an umbrella because it maybe didn't look like it was gonna rain
84-2_951.25_5.94.wav_ASR	but soon as he stepped outside and started walking a little bit the rain came down
84-2_957.89_1.84.wav_ASR	so he went back to his house
84-2_959.73_4.444.wav_ASR	and he he was all wet
84-2_964.39_3.26.wav_ASR	and his mother had a stern look on his face
84-2_967.95_1.755.wav_ASR	but there was nothing he could do
84-2_969.89_4.927.wav_ASR	so he got some new clothes and went back out into the rain
84-2_975.35_1.92.wav_ASR	but this time he had an umbrella
84-2_988.79_6.25.wav_ASR	but this is the picture of a young lady who had a cat stuck up in a tree
84-2_995.279_8.66.wav_ASR	so he she got off his tricycle and saw i think what must've been his dad
84-2_1004.61_2.312.wav_ASR	his dad climbed up the tree
84-2_1007.139_3.56.wav_ASR	then ladder broke and fell to the ground
84-2_1011.04_7.14.wav_ASR	there is a a ppy who's trying to see if maybe the man or could come down
84-2_1018.34_18.709.wav_ASR	but he he was up there and needed to be rescued by the fire department who came over and was going to get the husband down and perhaps i imagine also get the cat down
84-2_1188.82_0.522.wav_ASR	oh my god yeah
84-2_1190.29_11.04.wav_ASR	well so this is a story about cinderella and her two stepdaughters and her old stepdaughters
84-2_1202.87_5.93.wav_ASR	so i believe that cinderella needed some help
84-2_1208.85_10.08.wav_ASR	and since she was on her own she was able to get a job with the two stepsisters and the stepmothers
84-2_1219.6_12.86.wav_ASR	and she was doing a lot of stuff washing the clothes and cleaning the clothes and doing stuff like that and properly also doing the laundry
84-2_1233.61_13.66.wav_ASR	and then it came to pass that there was a prince who lived in the castle with his father and his mother
84-2_1247.87_7.51.wav_ASR	and he he was looking for somebody to fall in love with
84-2_1255.91_10.09.wav_ASR	so they everybody in the town got an invitation to this big party that they were gonna have
84-2_1266.0_7.976.wav_ASR	so the two stepsisters dressed up inside clothes and the mother went with them
84-2_1273.976_12.38.wav_ASR	and they went to the the the the prince the king was looking for her
84-2_1286.996_3.0.wav_ASR	and so he he decided to have this party
84-2_1290.119_5.02.wav_ASR	and so they were at the party
84-2_1295.299_12.78.wav_ASR	and then a fairy godmother came along and said to the young woman cinderella that cinderella should go to the party too
84-2_1308.226_9.88.wav_ASR	so she she was able to get a dress and some nice clothing including a some beautiful shoes
84-2_1319.006_8.0.wav_ASR	and they they they they lived to the wedding
84-2_1327.231_10.9.wav_ASR	and they came to the wedding in a special chariot which had a rider and i think of someone who was in the back
84-2_1338.211_7.36.wav_ASR	and they came out at the at the therapy at the party
84-2_1345.673_6.279.wav_ASR	and the the the prince was there
84-2_1352.133_2.54.wav_ASR	and the prince saw cinderella
84-2_1355.293_3.02.wav_ASR	and they had a very good time
84-2_1358.335_10.88.wav_ASR	but the prince hadta be home by midnight
84-2_1370.035_5.014.wav_ASR	so as the clock struck struck twelve she knew she hadta get out
84-2_1375.049_3.707.wav_ASR	so he left and left the prince there
84-2_1378.756_17.48.wav_ASR	and as he went out to the carriage the prince cinderella turned back into a a a a servant
84-2_1396.299_11.02.wav_ASR	they and the prince prince was really upset about what had happened
84-2_1407.593_17.28.wav_ASR	so he he sent some people from his castle to go out and see if he could find someone from his castle to go out and see if they could find him
84-2_1425.678_6.62.wav_ASR	and so she went to different houses and could not find anybody
84-2_1432.618_11.82.wav_ASR	when he went to the house where the two stepsisters lived she was wanted to know if anybody else was there
84-2_1444.93_13.02.wav_ASR	and somehow i think maybe he figured out that the young lady who was in the other room
84-2_1458.25_1.72.wav_ASR	so he brought up cinderella
84-2_1460.57_2.92.wav_ASR	and the shoes fit
84-2_1463.42_8.56.wav_ASR	so he went back to the prince and told him about this person
84-2_1472.66_6.16.wav_ASR	and eventually the person became close again with the prince
84-2_1480.57_3.74.wav_ASR	and and in the end the prince and cinderella got married
84-2_1514.01_3.94.wav_ASR	but i don't remember what i talked about last week
84-2_1518.63_6.689.wav_ASR	so there was always a clock in my house growing up
84-2_1526.11_3.865.wav_ASR	and so i i knew pretty easily what time it was
84-2_1530.23_1.698.wav_ASR	oh i think i know the story
84-2_1531.9_8.72.wav_ASR	and so i remember especially in high school that there wasn't really any time i hadta be home
84-2_1541.12_5.3.wav_ASR	so my parents said that you know when you get home is fine
84-2_1546.84_4.825.wav_ASR	you know obviously not too late but you you wanna have a good time
84-2_1551.665_5.02.wav_ASR	so especially on friday and saturday nights we useta go out with friends
84-2_1556.735_4.043.wav_ASR	you useta drink beer in one of my friends' bathrooms and then go out
84-2_1561.105_4.17.wav_ASR	and so we would go to different parties which was a lot fun
84-2_1565.275_7.34.wav_ASR	but i always made it home except one time i actually fell asleep at the wheel
84-2_1573.075_7.54.wav_ASR	but i was in the i was driving
84-2_1580.922_5.48.wav_ASR	and somebody else named one of my friends who was named tv was in the other
84-2_1587.065_3.064.wav_ASR	and he he yelled at me
84-2_1590.202_0.83.wav_ASR	and i woke up
84-2_1591.802_1.28.wav_ASR	and it was in a stop like
84-2_1593.302_0.94.wav_ASR	so nothing happened
84-2_1594.562_1.16.wav_ASR	and i was pretty lucky
84-2_1595.743_6.552.wav_ASR	so i guess it it's just good to know that a clock is always there knowing what time it is
84-2_1602.295_18.18.wav_ASR	and hopefully you know when i was in college i decided a couple different girls where i stayed a couple different girls where i was from in in washington
84-2_1621.213_5.323.wav_ASR	and so i had a job that started at six o'clock in the morning during the summer during the summer
84-2_1626.636_8.781.wav_ASR	so i useta stay out with my friends or at my girl's house until about four in the morning and then go to work
84-2_1635.473_3.123.wav_ASR	or i would come home and get my bike and then go to work
84-2_1638.596_3.3.wav_ASR	so it was fun but it was also pretty awesome
84-2_1661.747_12.78.wav_ASR	the only thing i can say about birds is that growing up i pretty much took birds for granted
84-2_1674.744_11.46.wav_ASR	and i remember even when i was in undergrad and when i went to law school i i mean i never thought about birds
84-2_1686.85_16.941.wav_ASR	but as i as i said to get well i guess that i worked a lot in when i was a lawyer
84-2_1703.791_4.937.wav_ASR	and then i went to a a company where i was for a long time
84-2_1709.271_8.12.wav_ASR	but now that i'm looking for stuff to do one of the things i'm pretty interested in doing is birdwatch
84-2_1718.071_2.377.wav_ASR	so it's something i'm gonna try to do
84-2_1720.448_13.26.wav_ASR	and i'm sure i told you but maybe i didn't that may i didn't that my that me and my wife are gonna move to south carolina and in a community there where i feel i can do some bird watching there where i feel like i can do some bird watching there
84-2_1734.128_1.611.wav_ASR	so i'd like to try it
84-2_1735.948_1.252.wav_ASR	hey i hope i'm good at it
84-2_1737.348_1.265.wav_ASR	and i hope i know what i'm doing
84-2_1738.613_8.402.wav_ASR	but it's important for me to find some habits that i can work out and try to get feel good about it
84-2_1751.233_2.428.wav_ASR	oh we're we're already picked a place
84-2_1753.973_1.755.wav_ASR	and kid kicked the ball
84-2_1755.813_0.848.wav_ASR	we've never been there
84-2_1757.804_3.6.wav_ASR	and it's off the coast of mexico
84-2_1763.495_4.149.wav_ASR	it's about forty minutes from charlotte airport
84-2_1768.604_1.36.wav_ASR	and it's a beautiful day
84-2_1772.244_3.34.wav_ASR	oh i don't wanna go into too much debt
84-2_1775.781_12.445.wav_ASR	but we we we are contracted a place there that's part of a condo that's right on the beach
84-2_1788.901_5.343.wav_ASR	and so so my wife is down there right now
84-2_1794.244_5.8.wav_ASR	so she could actually go into the building which is being constructed
84-2_1800.532_16.3.wav_ASR	and she was able to tell me that from where my cinderella's place that she actually see the beach you know for the ocean
84-2_1817.192_13.006.wav_ASR	so for me that was really nice because i i useta have a place in office which my wife really liked that i didn't like so much it
84-2_1830.198_1.1.wav_ASR	it was laid on the water
84-2_1831.912_4.94.wav_ASR	and so now i feel that i've been able to give something you know
84-2_1837.124_5.433.wav_ASR	some i've wanted to find a place that would be good for her
84-2_1843.004_3.038.wav_ASR	and i mean it's gonna be a little hot for me
84-2_1846.364_6.04.wav_ASR	but i think it's gonna be worth it because it's gonna be a great place for my life
84-2_1861.804_4.88.wav_ASR	he hit it is in is in south carolina or north carolina
84-2_1868.964_0.303.wav_ASR	okay
84-2_1877.712_1.04.wav_ASR	so it's pretty confusing
84-2_1879.112_1.64.wav_ASR	and i'm not very concerned so
84-2_1882.912_1.763.wav_ASR	but i think it should be
84-2_1885.012_4.164.wav_ASR	and we know some people down there who live there
84-2_1889.212_1.86.wav_ASR	so that's gonna be really helpful too
84-2_1891.217_9.274.wav_ASR	but the the person i know really well made a fortune in in a company that he was in
84-2_1900.657_4.7.wav_ASR	so he has a lot of places now all over the world in contacting people
84-2_1929.085_7.92.wav_ASR	well probably the hotel i stayed in some nice hotel
84-2_1937.925_5.3.wav_ASR	but probably the nicest hotel i stayed in was for my wedding
84-2_1943.216_11.64.wav_ASR	and i married a a lobster when i was in las vegas beach who lived in washington dc
84-2_1955.736_3.62.wav_ASR	so we got married at the four seasons hotel in jordan town
84-2_1960.256_1.29.wav_ASR	and that was a real nice place
84-2_1961.546_2.702.wav_ASR	we we we were able to be there for a couple days
84-2_1964.566_2.56.wav_ASR	we had a fair amount of people in our wedding like
84-2_1967.137_1.529.wav_ASR	it was about two hundred
84-2_1969.686_5.86.wav_ASR	and we were able to have a wedding on a sunday afternoon
84-2_1976.586_2.56.wav_ASR	and we had a nice lunch
84-2_1979.209_12.504.wav_ASR	and then i remember that many of my friends went down to a bar first down in georgia and had a nice evening there
84-2_1992.089_1.731.wav_ASR	so for me it was a good place
84-2_1994.369_2.18.wav_ASR	but totally i liked being home
84-2_1996.549_3.359.wav_ASR	so i you know i did it
84-2_1999.989_0.545.wav_ASR	so it was good
84-2_2000.709_3.348.wav_ASR	you know i like being where i am now
84-2_2196.154_4.351.wav_ASR	well i think i told you about my favorite restaurant in new york right there
84-2_2200.505_1.925.wav_ASR	the one that went through about twenty years
84-2_2204.4_1.8.wav_ASR	so i won't talk about that
84-2_2206.653_12.64.wav_ASR	well here in philadelphia i've got to know a few restaurants
84-2_2219.853_5.936.wav_ASR	because i lived here when i first took a job
84-2_2225.789_3.92.wav_ASR	oh i was a clock clock for a job in philadelphia
84-2_2230.669_3.36.wav_ASR	and then i lived here for awhile before i moved to phoenix
84-2_2234.197_14.716.wav_ASR	but one of the places i like to eat a lot all though it's gone up in price a a r r the restaurant is a restaurant in france
84-2_2249.537_1.139.wav_ASR	and i don't know if i told you
84-2_2250.676_4.494.wav_ASR	but i useta be able to speak french pretty well
84-2_2255.756_5.814.wav_ASR	and i like going there because they have a lot of good food
84-2_2262.196_5.2.wav_ASR	most of which is again to it's got to be over price like so many restaurants
84-2_2267.49_9.604.wav_ASR	but one thing i really like there is my my they have a hamper that's really nice
84-2_2277.79_5.42.wav_ASR	and it'll be cooked different way
84-2_2283.415_9.06.wav_ASR	and i like my meat very raw not completely cooked but cooked most of the way
84-2_2293.155_8.88.wav_ASR	and it's a really nice place to get a juicy burger and either a salad or some french fries
84-2_2302.33_4.163.wav_ASR	so if the fridge is usually for my wife
84-2_2307.01_2.4.wav_ASR	so i usually wind up getting a set of
84-2_2309.77_7.26.wav_ASR	but sometimes she makes me order the the the she she makes me order the
84-2_2336.29_0.91.wav_ASR	oh we hadta turn
84-2_2337.64_6.1.wav_ASR	well the peanut butter and jelly sandwich for me is pretty easy to eat
84-2_2344.78_4.14.wav_ASR	they go to the most of my bread is in the freezer
84-2_2349.56_2.46.wav_ASR	so i take out two pieces of bread
84-2_2352.03_13.906.wav_ASR	and i like a particular kind of peanut butter that is made at Costco which has nothing but peanuts in it
84-2_2365.936_10.164.wav_ASR	and so i usually put when i have a peanut butter jelly sandwich which later has been cared of more frequently for some reason i don't know
84-2_2376.676_2.695.wav_ASR	and then i'll take just about any jelly
84-2_2379.371_10.336.wav_ASR	but i found a jelly at i think at windows that has three different types of fruit in it
84-2_2389.5_27.09.wav_ASR	and so i put that with some with peanut butter on a bread that is a bread that is a type of wheat bread that i find to be very good
84-2_2416.69_4.042.wav_ASR	so i i'm gonna have a sandwich a little later today
84-2_2420.83_1.92.wav_ASR	but i'm probably gonna have a turkey sandwich
84-2_2423.13_2.155.wav_ASR	but yeah i like peanut butter and jelly a lot
84-2_2425.63_8.46.wav_ASR	and i've got the i've got the sandwich down to a side
84-2_2440.382_15.965.wav_ASR	well we i think i may have told you that we useta live in an apartment that we own across the hall
84-2_2456.416_4.325.wav_ASR	but we found somebody that we thought we could sell it to
84-2_2460.976_7.3.wav_ASR	and it turned out that he the two of them brought it at a price that i think was pretty good
84-2_2468.485_11.2.wav_ASR	so while we were waiting for the place to be built in korea we moved it turned out across the hall where there's a real unit
84-2_2479.5_13.0.wav_ASR	so and there's a washer and a dryer with all the all the
84-2_2493.08_0.68.wav_ASR	the roads
84-2_2494.18_4.5.wav_ASR	all the locations i guess you could have a washer in a dryer
84-2_2499.03_7.61.wav_ASR	so usually there may be a couple pieces of cold that may go to the why clean
84-2_2506.81_8.7.wav_ASR	but for the most part i will open the
84-2_2516.541_5.6.wav_ASR	it's a washer that works it it opens from the side
84-2_2522.721_4.203.wav_ASR	so i've put all the clothes in which is something i'm still able to do
84-2_2527.541_5.5.wav_ASR	and then i will turn on the washer
84-2_2533.721_1.86.wav_ASR	usually it's on a cold side
84-2_2535.923_4.6.wav_ASR	and once it starts moving a little bit i put in the dirt
84-2_2541.603_5.972.wav_ASR	and for some reason this this washer takes a longer time
84-2_2548.263_2.18.wav_ASR	and about an hour it's done
84-2_2550.963_2.58.wav_ASR	and the clothes have always come up pretty clean
84-2_2553.677_3.5.wav_ASR	so i then put them in the dryer
84-2_2558.157_3.06.wav_ASR	and that's about another forty five minutes
84-2_2561.777_10.454.wav_ASR	but usually within two hours the clothes come out and their ready to be filled which for me take a while because i only have the one hand
84-2_2572.231_6.68.wav_ASR	so what i've tried to do is just let the stuff that i like to do is just let it go in my closet
84-2_2579.691_1.311.wav_ASR	and lordas at her own
84-2_2582.091_6.46.wav_ASR	yeah she her clothes get washed with mine but i can't really put them away
84-2_2588.911_1.977.wav_ASR	and she's got a lot more clothing than i do
84-2_2605.921_5.7.wav_ASR	well i i grew up with a lot of flowers
84-2_2612.441_6.897.wav_ASR	but somehow when i married lawra that was not one of the things that she was really interested in
84-2_2619.338_7.26.wav_ASR	so we we have a few not a lot of flocks around our apartment
84-2_2627.098_3.1.wav_ASR	but i had a birthday in march
84-2_2630.778_6.74.wav_ASR	and one of the people i've become very close with is a personal trainer named firstnameg
84-2_2637.618_7.84.wav_ASR	and so firstnamej has been with me for about two and a half years
84-2_2645.678_7.36.wav_ASR	and she got a small plant for me that is the only living plant in this apartment
84-2_2654.178_0.9.wav_ASR	and for some reason
84-2_2655.359_3.54.wav_ASR	and i got it at the end of
84-2_2661.499_3.353.wav_ASR	and for some reason the plant is still chugging along
84-2_2664.959_0.989.wav_ASR	it's doing pretty well
84-2_2666.159_8.647.wav_ASR	so i feel good that i can keep a plant now for four months
84-2_2681.403_5.463.wav_ASR	the biggest issues is that i don't hafta water it very often
84-2_2689.146_3.773.wav_ASR	but i can show it to you but i don't know what it is
84-2_2692.919_6.577.wav_ASR	maybe at the end if we have enough time i'll see it
84-2_2699.679_5.76.wav_ASR	but it's it's just hard for me to see because it's on the window over there
84-2_2707.71_1.15.wav_ASR	but you did your plan
84-2_2725.24_2.756.wav_ASR	well find the easy ones to start with
54-1_7.551_3.64.wav_ASR	and yeah
54-1_21.615_0.5.wav_ASR	and boom
54-1_45.538_0.63.wav_ASR	clock
54-1_52.124_1.42.wav_ASR	so i said
54-1_54.165_0.92.wav_ASR	what am i supposed to do
54-1_58.042_0.47.wav_ASR	so yeah
54-1_65.795_0.53.wav_ASR	oh yeah
54-1_67.255_0.52.wav_ASR	that's not it
54-1_79.297_1.64.wav_ASR	and oh no
54-1_83.228_2.09.wav_ASR	and i was very glad yeah
54-1_85.678_3.31.wav_ASR	so there's well you know
54-1_92.23_8.37.wav_ASR	alright the hotel
54-1_100.647_2.22.wav_ASR	why it is you know
54-1_110.078_0.49.wav_ASR	and i said
54-1_120.106_2.56.wav_ASR	oh long time don't know

61-1_25.037_0.33.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
61-1_26.772_10.59.wav_ASR	first of all i had a session i
61-1_37.381_1.15.wav_ASR	but i couldn't speak
61-1_38.607_5.59.wav_ASR	and then as all of a sudden i started speaking again
61-1_45.366_12.18.wav_ASR	and i was two forty seven over ninety
61-1_58.751_15.99.wav_ASR	so i asked to go to the ambulance and go to the the
61-1_76.25_3.64.wav_ASR	and when i got there he couldn't find anything wrong with me
61-1_80.439_7.66.wav_ASR	but he he thought he would put me in a a place
61-1_88.709_1.3.wav_ASR	and they put me in
61-1_90.349_3.38.wav_ASR	they hooked me up and did everything
61-1_95.155_1.83.wav_ASR	and i was doing fine

61-1_98.399_1.83.wav_ASR	and i was talking fine
61-1_100.966_6.14.wav_ASR	and the doctor came in and was going to discharge me
61-1_107.936_1.9.wav_ASR	and i couldn't talk
61-1_111.68_0.89.wav_ASR	and so he goes
61-1_112.95_2.58.wav_ASR	oh i think you better stay
61-1_117.965_4.57.wav_ASR	and then i went
61-1_123.467_9.27.wav_ASR	and the nurse was sposta help me go to the restroom but she didn't
61-1_133.067_3.3.wav_ASR	and i went into the restaurant

61-1_140.685_3.91.wav_ASR	and they got me off
61-1_144.655_8.54.wav_ASR	and they took me down to do another head scan
61-1_154.705_13.28.wav_ASR	and then they hooked me up to a a bird air plane and drove me up to michigan
61-1_169.781_4.37.wav_ASR	and then it gets kind of like me
61-1_174.309_2.62.wav_ASR	and that's not it

61-1_188.082_10.52.wav_ASR	and the next day i woke up and i i just thought not very well
61-1_200.408_8.51.wav_ASR	and i started having all kinds of trouble
61-1_226.007_5.97.wav_ASR	well i i was in rehab for four or five weeks
61-1_233.191_11.69.wav_ASR	and i finally got to the point where i could you know walk with my walker
61-1_245.707_15.99.wav_ASR	and here i could speak more terms and you know help me do better
61-1_262.172_3.67.wav_ASR	and i didn't have any movement of my arm
61-1_266.267_3.84.wav_ASR	and then i went home
61-1_315.699_2.93.wav_ASR	and i did that for a year
61-1_330.479_11.46.wav_ASR	yeah i i worked with a a a

61-1_356.687_5.12.wav_ASR	so she worked one day week with me on all those
61-1_362.665_17.62.wav_ASR	and then i had three exercises that i did with my legs my arms you know
61-1_380.9_21.52.wav_ASR	as far as the little as far as the i didn't do anymore speech mainly because the speech was gonna cause money

61-1_588.979_0.31.wav_ASR	and he says
61-1_589.931_1.01.wav_ASR	now i don't want it
61-1_592.076_3.31.wav_ASR	and so he walked
61-1_595.58_1.7.wav_ASR	and he was all dressed
61-1_598.168_0.88.wav_ASR	and he came home
61-1_599.072_1.87.wav_ASR	and he was all dressed

63-1_318.802_1.81.wav_ASR	and he got soaked wet
63-1_321.731_2.41.wav_ASR	so he went back home
63-1_324.164_4.18.wav_ASR	and his mother was really mad at that
63-1_328.364_3.0.wav_ASR	and so he took the umbrella
63-1_333.482_4.93.wav_ASR	and then he when he got home he gave it to his mother
63-1_360.885_0.43.wav_ASR	okay
63-1_361.333_5.35.wav_ASR	hey do you wanna just tell you right now
63-1_371.077_0.39.wav_ASR	okay
63-1_371.488_1.82.wav_ASR	hey i'm ready
63-1_373.954_9.02.wav_ASR	there's a ladder on the ground
63-1_382.989_5.11.wav_ASR	and and it was used to catch a cat
63-1_388.361_1.55.wav_ASR	but it was on the
63-1_390.248_1.3.wav_ASR	so i did
63-1_392.33_9.53.wav_ASR	and i needed to take the dog up to the boy so he could get
63-1_402.248_11.88.wav_ASR	but he he couldn't get up because the dog was grabbing on
63-1_414.71_2.09.wav_ASR	so i got some firemen
63-1_416.822_3.82.wav_ASR	and and he he got up there
63-1_421.431_4.55.wav_ASR	and on the way to the ground he saw rain
63-1_425.998_2.87.wav_ASR	and and yeah
63-1_965.553_24.44.wav_ASR	se cinderella went cinderella with cinderella for her two sisters and her mother
63-1_990.015_24.73.wav_ASR	and they told him she couldn't go to the she she couldn't go to the
63-1_1017.014_15.52.wav_ASR	so but cinderella had a fairy godmother who got her all dressed up and sent her to the ball
63-1_1032.558_7.14.wav_ASR	and at midnight she she
63-1_1043.301_2.52.wav_ASR	and she lost her slipper
63-1_1045.915_8.16.wav_ASR	and so everyone was wondering about it
63-1_1055.11_1.24.wav_ASR	because you only had water
63-1_1056.449_6.94.wav_ASR	and then the clock came and said he had the other slipper
63-1_1063.516_1.95.wav_ASR	and he kicked it forward
63-1_1065.485_2.85.wav_ASR	and her slipper
63-1_1069.277_5.73.wav_ASR	so the cinderella and the prince lived happily ever
63-1_1076.923_0.77.wav_ASR	so something like that
63-1_1089.922_3.5.wav_ASR	and i get
63-1_1094.826_14.33.wav_ASR	and i put jelly on one slice and pour it in the other
63-1_1109.178_2.18.wav_ASR	and i put it together
63-2_8.939_3.81.wav_ASR	my speech is okay
63-2_12.805_5.82.wav_ASR	but a lot of times i i know what it is but i can't say
63-2_20.929_0.67.wav_ASR	that's what it is
63-2_21.647_1.36.wav_ASR	so i know what it is
63-2_23.054_4.5.wav_ASR	and until someone told me what it is i just can't say it
63-2_27.999_0.71.wav_ASR	and i don't know why
63-2_28.733_2.26.wav_ASR	it's the way it is now
63-2_38.859_0.35.wav_ASR	yeah
63-2_44.303_3.08.wav_ASR	well i got up in the morning
63-2_48.081_2.82.wav_ASR	and right away i i i rode over
63-2_51.772_2.14.wav_ASR	and she she was by my side
63-2_54.63_3.83.wav_ASR	and i told her i felt a little quiesque
63-2_59.076_3.32.wav_ASR	and she sang songs much about it
63-2_62.957_13.02.wav_ASR	so then i i i went to the bathroom and did my thing
63-2_76.575_5.33.wav_ASR	and then right after i did my thing something happened in here
63-2_83.156_2.36.wav_ASR	and i says
63-2_86.28_0.56.wav_ASR	oh no
63-2_87.247_4.1.wav_ASR	and that's the last thing i remember for a week
63-2_110.622_8.52.wav_ASR	well the last thing i knew before my stroke hit was
63-2_119.546_6.29.wav_ASR	well after my stroke i woke up
63-2_125.884_5.95.wav_ASR	and i remember this this was an ambulance emergency vehicle
63-2_131.943_3.96.wav_ASR	so the next thing i know i'm back in wheelchair
63-2_137.638_4.23.wav_ASR	and i'm on a bed
63-2_141.886_3.02.wav_ASR	but my wife still there
63-2_145.895_8.26.wav_ASR	and and i i slowly started talking to her
63-2_154.83_6.86.wav_ASR	at at the first thing i don't think i made much sense to him
63-2_161.771_2.36.wav_ASR	but she was always there for me
63-2_166.318_5.94.wav_ASR	so you know it was okay because i i could tell her anything i wanted
63-2_172.567_0.74.wav_ASR	and she missed
63-2_174.287_2.43.wav_ASR	did or whatever she could
63-2_179.54_8.31.wav_ASR	and then after a while two or three nurses would come in every day
63-2_187.899_9.62.wav_ASR	and they would do crazy things like lift my legs and lift my back
63-2_197.735_3.12.wav_ASR	and every day it was something different
63-2_200.878_1.4.wav_ASR	and i would go down the hall
63-2_203.68_13.15.wav_ASR	and they would do leg lift dry dry trying to get me whatever
63-2_216.852_3.61.wav_ASR	and i i would do do stairs
63-2_220.72_2.27.wav_ASR	so i remember that i just stayed there
63-2_223.735_6.54.wav_ASR	did a lot of i don't know
63-2_231.307_0.98.wav_ASR	and i don't know
63-2_232.337_1.88.wav_ASR	but we were always somebody there
63-2_234.266_4.36.wav_ASR	and there always always somebody doing something to me
63-2_238.866_2.82.wav_ASR	lot of it i don't know anymore
63-2_241.734_6.07.wav_ASR	but it was very for the first couple weeks it was very exhausting
63-2_270.707_16.25.wav_ASR	well the the the best thing i can remember before my stroke was getting married of course
63-2_287.802_2.96.wav_ASR	and i was in the service at the time
63-2_290.815_10.36.wav_ASR	but we before my before i was of professional office i was also in the air force for twenty two years
63-2_302.963_14.46.wav_ASR	so other than that i think the thing that i do the most about is in hilton group resort
63-2_318.711_10.5.wav_ASR	my i was very interested in basketball and baseball sports ball and and especially football
63-2_330.401_3.01.wav_ASR	had a lot of good memories about food
63-2_335.59_16.4.wav_ASR	yeah i i was not blown my own horn but after the seizure i was the best player dependent on the team
63-2_352.759_1.93.wav_ASR	had a lot of interaction
63-2_356.795_1.32.wav_ASR	about a lot of things happened
63-2_358.702_5.14.wav_ASR	but there's a a lot of things
63-2_363.887_3.23.wav_ASR	so there's so much i
63-2_367.253_10.28.wav_ASR	you know there's so many things good and bad that happened to me
63-2_377.551_2.11.wav_ASR	but i i can't do anything
63-2_379.803_3.54.wav_ASR	so fast as a lot of my mind don't even remember anymore
63-2_384.569_2.54.wav_ASR	they're either develop child or whatever
63-2_387.736_1.31.wav_ASR	but that that's the way it is
63-2_411.303_0.58.wav_ASR	okay
63-2_413.03_4.45.wav_ASR	there there was a boy who kicked the ball
63-2_417.912_3.64.wav_ASR	and the ball went into a a glass window
63-2_422.674_15.1.wav_ASR	and when it went into the window and it hit the guy on the ladder and knocked over the lamp
63-2_438.726_2.45.wav_ASR	and so she he grabbed the lamp
63-2_442.108_7.4.wav_ASR	and he he told him he wasn't getting it back to the lamp was fixed
63-2_481.005_0.36.wav_ASR	okay
63-2_481.732_8.03.wav_ASR	the boy did not want to take an umbrella
63-2_491.361_5.2.wav_ASR	he he he said it was okay that she didn't have
63-2_497.241_6.7.wav_ASR	so he he he walked out in the rain and saw it was raining
63-2_504.464_2.37.wav_ASR	so he hadta go back home
63-2_508.083_4.21.wav_ASR	and he was all wet himself
63-2_512.317_9.689.wav_ASR	and so she hadta get her umbrella
63-2_522.629_3.17.wav_ASR	and she put it in her hand
63-2_525.853_3.21.wav_ASR	and he went to school with a
63-2_544.992_0.48.wav_ASR	okay
63-2_557.835_3.71.wav_ASR	hey first of all i see a little girl
63-2_561.562_1.48.wav_ASR	and she's trying to get a cat
63-2_564.448_3.49.wav_ASR	but her her ladder fell
63-2_568.152_0.97.wav_ASR	so she couldn't get
63-2_569.138_10.13.wav_ASR	so she she went to her father father who couldn't get it either because the ladder was gone
63-2_579.979_9.18.wav_ASR	and he had a real he had a dog
63-2_589.176_4.92.wav_ASR	and and had a
63-2_594.116_4.12.wav_ASR	and he up up the tree tried to get
63-2_599.141_4.71.wav_ASR	and so because she couldn't
63-2_603.984_1.24.wav_ASR	and she couldn't get the cat
63-2_606.497_1.25.wav_ASR	couldn't get the dog
63-2_608.377_9.35.wav_ASR	and she went with the firemen who got her out and got her everything back to normal
63-2_1440.511_0.74.wav_ASR	okay
63-2_1441.268_16.0.wav_ASR	when the grandmother and her two grandchildren were small they brought in cinderella to clean up the house
63-2_1458.806_6.78.wav_ASR	and cinderella did all the work
63-2_1466.686_10.03.wav_ASR	and as kids got older there were more things for cinderella to do that they wanted to
63-2_1478.756_14.77.wav_ASR	and finally they they got an invitation from the prince that there was gonna be a gal at the prince's palace
63-2_1495.182_6.21.wav_ASR	and they they told her she couldn't go because she she wasn't invited
63-2_1501.414_1.13.wav_ASR	and it didn't really bite
63-2_1503.72_13.93.wav_ASR	so after they were gone the fairy godmother showed up and and showed them how she could do
63-2_1518.63_15.49.wav_ASR	and so the first thing the fairy godmother did was turned all the mice and everything into the carriage and the horse and
63-2_1535.312_12.67.wav_ASR	and then cinderella was was given a fine dress to wear
63-2_1549.523_20.5.wav_ASR	and when she got to the ball the only thing the only thing that she got to the ball the prince could see nothing but cinderella
63-2_1571.01_3.63.wav_ASR	and they danced the night away
63-2_1575.707_4.89.wav_ASR	and then at twelve o'clock she says she hadta
63-2_1580.617_5.67.wav_ASR	so while she was going one of her slippers was left on the ground
63-2_1586.306_15.28.wav_ASR	so when she got home cinderella was back on her in her chaperones with dogs and cats and everything
63-2_1601.634_26.69.wav_ASR	and then the the shoe well was supposta be broken by the the the the shoe
63-2_1629.078_3.66.wav_ASR	but they they it was
63-2_1632.753_6.42.wav_ASR	and so cinderella put on a shoe
63-2_1639.194_4.61.wav_ASR	and she and it was action movie other other
63-2_1644.445_0.98.wav_ASR	so she knew was
63-2_1646.792_3.37.wav_ASR	and so her prince got married
63-2_1650.177_1.77.wav_ASR	and he lived happily ever
63-2_1666.397_8.74.wav_ASR	you put two slices of bread together
63-2_1675.69_2.37.wav_ASR	one with peanut peanut and one with jelly
63-2_1678.161_2.74.wav_ASR	and you get them to go
63-2_1680.917_3.87.wav_ASR	and you got your peanut butter jelly sandwich
65-1_9.517_0.96.wav_ASR	seems to be academic
65-1_28.81_2.53.wav_ASR	the eighteen ninety five days before i remember as five days before
65-1_35.471_0.49.wav_ASR	alright she says
65-1_36.531_2.9.wav_ASR	but happened on a thirtieth eighteen forty four
65-1_40.334_5.76.wav_ASR	we're some friends of have some friends who have suffered the previous trauma
65-1_46.238_15.54.wav_ASR	and i remember nothing nothing after until until i c u and started short of remembering things slowly about three days after i moved out of i c u
65-1_63.223_3.95.wav_ASR	and he the eighteen ninety nine
65-1_67.496_0.83.wav_ASR	and i see the
65-1_69.041_4.34.wav_ASR	it was crossing tenni avenue in an an intersection
65-1_74.421_2.67.wav_ASR	and i remember crossing in the patient crossroads road
65-1_77.109_7.56.wav_ASR	trying with the light and seeing getting up close to the corner on the car going from west east east
65-1_86.021_1.74.wav_ASR	and then i had the situation he's standing around
65-1_87.783_6.82.wav_ASR	and that's that's last i remember something from last last twenty twenty years or so
65-1_104.608_1.57.wav_ASR	you know i need one
65-1_107.092_0.66.wav_ASR	and they found her
65-1_107.8_10.32.wav_ASR	that was very disturbing because really disturbing because didn't know where i was
65-1_119.162_6.17.wav_ASR	and there were visitors in my hospital room in in in my hospital room
65-1_125.543_3.84.wav_ASR	and these guys were saying they the firemen
65-1_129.431_3.17.wav_ASR	and i knew who knew these these people
65-1_132.616_1.52.wav_ASR	but there's a lot lots of them there
65-1_134.184_1.5.wav_ASR	and i didn't know where i was
65-1_136.291_2.12.wav_ASR	there were lots of people visiting me
65-1_138.802_1.63.wav_ASR	and there's several matches
65-1_141.127_1.76.wav_ASR	oh when is his voice gonna come back
65-1_143.169_1.03.wav_ASR	when his voice gonna come back
65-1_145.808_1.58.wav_ASR	and i thought i was perfectly fine
65-1_148.727_11.07.wav_ASR	but what i didn't know was that the i spent ten days with a breathing tube hooked down my throat
65-1_160.403_2.47.wav_ASR	and then look like it was gonna come outta time soon
65-1_162.888_1.7.wav_ASR	and they gave me a tracheotomy
65-1_165.547_13.33.wav_ASR	and so the what turned out to be scar tissue and vascular cord chains my voice hadta tell me
65-1_178.901_7.83.wav_ASR	and she said that you you you hadta date
65-1_190.21_0.31.wav_ASR	so she says
65-1_190.701_1.11.wav_ASR	actually they're they were
65-1_191.914_1.46.wav_ASR	that one thing you like about me
65-1_193.584_0.55.wav_ASR	and that was gone
65-1_194.184_7.67.wav_ASR	but that was so important because i i didn't know where i was
65-1_202.556_3.45.wav_ASR	when people recognize it's we recognize seeing the same
65-1_206.835_1.36.wav_ASR	when is his wife gonna come back
65-1_208.855_1.99.wav_ASR	and i was really really hungry
65-1_211.097_0.7.wav_ASR	really challenging
65-1_214.441_2.34.wav_ASR	that was that was one of my memories for my memory
65-1_227.068_4.71.wav_ASR	well it's what happened was the the the
65-1_232.093_9.72.wav_ASR	and terms of my brain injuries if you fell out and were affected things kinda stand out and were important trouble
65-1_242.008_14.18.wav_ASR	and when when i happen to get hooked on something i didn't forget or or improve of i it didn't show
65-1_256.236_2.98.wav_ASR	but it was extremely angry
65-1_261.478_2.001.wav_ASR	and they never lived happily ever
65-1_264.808_2.63.wav_ASR	but just really angry
65-1_267.486_1.47.wav_ASR	and i kept on trying
65-1_268.978_5.53.wav_ASR	so it was very very trouble really difficult for a a lot of work
65-1_291.425_2.81.wav_ASR	and and i don't want you to repeat that
65-1_294.408_3.91.wav_ASR	and i wouldn't wish that it wouldn't work at any body
65-1_316.655_7.65.wav_ASR	the almost ninety nine is almost what
65-1_324.396_0.55.wav_ASR	again
65-1_325.376_0.84.wav_ASR	and so so he says
65-1_326.232_3.43.wav_ASR	it was just just a rent but not near as severe as severe
65-1_330.55_12.55.wav_ASR	but the the eighteen fourth sentence was was most interesting because an injury from my the come across by
65-1_343.181_6.64.wav_ASR	and i was on what they called high pressure hydrology meeting i had a wonderful career in me
65-1_349.842_1.58.wav_ASR	he was gonna go for an operation
65-1_352.182_4.66.wav_ASR	and and my one of my supervisors told me
65-1_356.862_0.89.wav_ASR	and he was supposta do that
65-1_357.802_6.2.wav_ASR	that told me i was on the highway which met again again in my i was going for
65-1_364.136_1.18.wav_ASR	my curve is laid in front of it
65-1_366.048_2.15.wav_ASR	they were nothing shocking me
65-1_369.12_8.58.wav_ASR	and then after the eighty four inch pencil change which i find out twenty years ago in md p t
65-1_377.717_1.63.wav_ASR	would i find twenty years in medicology
65-1_380.151_3.17.wav_ASR	and the and by sound difference
65-1_384.141_2.67.wav_ASR	oh i was slow to comprehend things
65-1_387.869_5.87.wav_ASR	but finally did after taking taking more time for comprehension
65-1_393.757_7.06.wav_ASR	and and and i couldn't do my engineering job to to suit me
65-1_401.669_1.51.wav_ASR	and i didn't tell anybody about it
65-1_403.668_0.89.wav_ASR	and i didn't do anything about it
65-1_404.612_0.8.wav_ASR	okay i faked it
65-1_406.295_17.87.wav_ASR	and i faced it and spent my lunch hours for months by myself in a conference room reconfiguring my job and not telling a story of my job and not telling a story because i just
65-1_424.226_1.26.wav_ASR	and this before friday afternoon
65-1_426.413_1.47.wav_ASR	and i need nine eight again
65-1_428.188_2.09.wav_ASR	and actually before the accidents of December it was like
65-1_430.428_0.54.wav_ASR	eat it
65-1_432.046_2.46.wav_ASR	and and i was on the accident ninety four
65-1_434.528_1.11.wav_ASR	and i'd don't consider business
65-1_436.8_5.82.wav_ASR	and i i just knew that that my gotta complain about my job
65-1_443.288_1.95.wav_ASR	and actually i just knew i was gonna get fired
65-1_445.562_0.85.wav_ASR	and knew i was
65-1_447.165_8.14.wav_ASR	had three kids a sweet little lovely little woman there home with three kids
65-1_455.32_2.19.wav_ASR	and i was the king
65-1_458.431_2.45.wav_ASR	and i couldn't stay thought of being fired
65-1_461.855_5.49.wav_ASR	and so i could say did everything i could to relearn my job
65-1_467.981_7.74.wav_ASR	and took me probably two years to figure out that that i was no longer on the fast track
65-1_476.146_1.08.wav_ASR	and no no no no
65-1_477.247_2.36.wav_ASR	you took it wasn't as good as I thought
65-1_479.684_3.22.wav_ASR	but i it was no longer a factor
65-1_482.928_9.4.wav_ASR	and and the big most difficult part of that was the short term memory difficulties
65-1_493.261_11.8.wav_ASR	and so i ended up with a french language pathologist and would write down everything in there just to help my short term memory
65-1_506.11_10.319.wav_ASR	so it was largely the aphasia and and people seeing me differently at work
65-1_516.482_4.701.wav_ASR	and then of course i look back back back on it a few years after
65-1_521.2_2.859.wav_ASR	and and i did not deserve to be on the fast track
65-1_524.107_3.97.wav_ASR	yeah yeah it was perfectly obvious everybody around me
65-1_528.092_0.72.wav_ASR	you weren't able to understand me
65-1_530.176_14.41.wav_ASR	and that the writing everything down was was the biggest issue to me at to help me do my job
65-1_567.07_6.54.wav_ASR	the the they
65-1_573.891_4.62.wav_ASR	so i i call it pretty eight or nine o'clock every four or five
65-1_579.419_5.17.wav_ASR	that's that's how my life has been different
65-1_585.51_11.37.wav_ASR	and i that is that is that is that is that is that is the the defining moment for the the the finding event
65-1_597.64_8.89.wav_ASR	because i've struggled with the the aphasia obviously and memory issues ever since
65-1_606.552_13.22.wav_ASR	and and and i mean like for me the the the water of seventy six seventy seven i was out of engineering school up there
65-1_619.826_1.84.wav_ASR	and had a job in annapolis
65-1_621.855_7.67.wav_ASR	and so the acute v i i paid rent to my folks live in their house
65-1_630.113_6.18.wav_ASR	and that water my dad and i put the olive bill a little small car
65-1_637.015_3.44.wav_ASR	and it was quite an interesting interesting problem
65-1_641.315_4.08.wav_ASR	and and interesting enough i could probably
65-1_645.41_8.3.wav_ASR	the the the the engine had a crack in it which had some difficulty
65-1_653.791_1.8.wav_ASR	and i could probably still today
65-1_655.869_1.58.wav_ASR	and this is nineteen sixty seven
65-1_658.288_2.76.wav_ASR	maybe i'll stay there reeling the camera blindfolded
65-1_662.6_3.89.wav_ASR	but i but asked me what i had for supper last night
65-1_667.122_0.49.wav_ASR	can't tie
65-1_669.274_0.66.wav_ASR	so yeah
65-1_670.235_1.4.wav_ASR	short short memory issues
65-1_671.658_13.02.wav_ASR	but then things from from long ago and do do something long ago like i can't recall what was yesterday
65-1_695.671_5.07.wav_ASR	now actually i was invited to a conference there
65-1_701.591_4.64.wav_ASR	and and i got outta school the spring of seventy six
65-1_706.317_1.95.wav_ASR	and at a job of kindergartener shift
65-1_709.739_0.87.wav_ASR	they're in napa valley
65-1_710.687_2.65.wav_ASR	and i couldn't think of no longer exist
65-1_714.262_5.09.wav_ASR	but i was engined crew engineer at with a shipster
65-1_720.011_10.31.wav_ASR	and so so i my my cousins will call it for firstnamee's friday thirtieths drive
65-1_731.149_9.58.wav_ASR	four of the whole four pats cars had a cat like a kitty cat
65-1_745.046_7.51.wav_ASR	and the seventy five mcl cl v d i c t patients that were all in my clinic customers
65-1_753.154_4.14.wav_ASR	so i was already doing that kind as my as a job
65-1_758.166_6.91.wav_ASR	but then my my father found this this artificial valve on an engine vehicle
65-1_765.797_12.68.wav_ASR	and it was a problem where he's unable to get through that window while while while while while i was working the obstetric history field
65-1_778.497_8.96.wav_ASR	and and it it's kinda how kinda how i graduated
65-1_815.779_2.14.wav_ASR	so it was real sleepy
65-1_818.492_4.39.wav_ASR	the the the cat at the top of the tree was the dad's two forty seven
65-1_823.884_3.99.wav_ASR	and it was at the first of the the dan west coast as as he car
65-1_828.597_6.2.wav_ASR	and and he used to for stop lights those guys off
65-1_835.141_6.83.wav_ASR	and they could they and the other guys the the driveway could figure a hole in the driveway
65-1_842.229_5.21.wav_ASR	it was a lot of fun seeing my friends as it was in my rehab
65-1_910.099_1.2.wav_ASR	okay
65-1_911.875_2.36.wav_ASR	the story is there's a a young ladder
65-1_914.589_8.46.wav_ASR	looks like maybe twenty eight or seventy grade the kicking a soccer ball
65-1_923.492_6.72.wav_ASR	and then eric kicks the soccer ball through a a house window
65-1_930.915_8.97.wav_ASR	and the soccer ball comes through the house window and lands on a an an an adult male mailman's lap in the house
65-1_940.813_7.32.wav_ASR	and the adult male gets up holding the soccer ball and looks through the window and says to figure out what's going on
65-1_951.714_0.38.wav_ASR	they didn't
65-1_971.063_5.65.wav_ASR	looks like a a young boy is leaving
65-1_976.736_2.88.wav_ASR	and as we say his mother says
65-1_979.897_1.4.wav_ASR	here's your umbrella
65-1_981.983_0.84.wav_ASR	and he says
65-1_983.049_1.03.wav_ASR	and i don't need that
65-1_984.13_4.77.wav_ASR	and then they he leaves saying goodbye and everything
65-1_989.831_1.61.wav_ASR	and the mom holding the umbrella
65-1_991.969_3.23.wav_ASR	and the the young ladder is out about walking around
65-1_995.914_1.2.wav_ASR	and it starts to rain
65-1_997.78_1.36.wav_ASR	and it starts to rain here
65-1_999.75_0.79.wav_ASR	and he is running
65-1_1000.563_4.18.wav_ASR	and gets back to his mom so soaking wet
65-1_1005.358_0.87.wav_ASR	and he's not happy
65-1_1006.245_1.13.wav_ASR	you know at night she happened
65-1_1008.212_2.37.wav_ASR	and then he goes out finally with an umbrella
65-1_1010.631_3.09.wav_ASR	and and it looks like all is wet
65-1_1027.309_5.9.wav_ASR	well the beginning it looks like a cat a cat that climbed up a tree
65-1_1034.269_3.46.wav_ASR	and being chased by a dog kind of a cat
65-1_1038.222_1.16.wav_ASR	and it stuck up in the tree
65-1_1040.013_8.761.wav_ASR	the little girl who was probably her roommate grew over there her cycle and then closes her cat down
65-1_1049.333_10.48.wav_ASR	and looks like a adult male most likely her dad climbed up the tree to get the cat and as as caught up there by this barking dog
65-1_1060.56_5.52.wav_ASR	so and now there's also a a bird overhead the tree singing away
65-1_1066.533_11.02.wav_ASR	and there also the local fire department is showing up with their ladder to trying to get down both the the cat and the the the male the the the male figure
65-1_1077.577_2.22.wav_ASR	that's that's that'd treat by the dog
65-1_1353.355_0.3.wav_ASR	yeah thank you
65-1_1353.835_5.45.wav_ASR	and cinderella was her mother had passed away
65-1_1360.127_2.77.wav_ASR	father remarried
65-1_1363.72_8.84.wav_ASR	and the wicked stepmother and brought her two two older men servants
65-1_1373.655_13.75.wav_ASR	and they in their home life the cinderella's treated poorly by the stepmothers and abused how we say by the stepdaughters
65-1_1387.769_7.59.wav_ASR	and and so it just worked very worked a lot
65-1_1395.968_9.9.wav_ASR	and in the kingdom the king had a a an amazing son
65-1_1406.524_19.39.wav_ASR	and one of his king and in the kingdom he wanted to have a ball to with the the entourage sat at the throne with the the prince married off
65-1_1427.134_24.41.wav_ASR	and so cinderella with the help of the mice and they're in the house where it's a really lovely gown for cinderella to to wear to this where his dance where it wore his his ball
65-1_1451.694_17.08.wav_ASR	and and the stepmother was intent on getting one of her her her her daughters married off and and then so would allow cinderella to go to the ball
65-1_1469.504_3.98.wav_ASR	her the stepsisters went
65-1_1474.182_11.98.wav_ASR	and and a a carriage looked like a pumpkin and then mice went up in the horses
65-1_1486.874_8.89.wav_ASR	and i think the the horse from the house ended up as the the driver of the the pumpkin carriage
65-1_1496.594_3.35.wav_ASR	and she she needed going to the ball
65-1_1499.966_5.76.wav_ASR	also the the the prince danced night and day with a cinderella
65-1_1506.4_12.64.wav_ASR	but the situation back from the hospital he hadta back my mind because everything was gonna go back to the way it was at midnight
65-1_1519.217_1.04.wav_ASR	so it was
65-1_1520.273_3.71.wav_ASR	so she heard out of there and left a glass slipper behind
65-1_1524.602_11.17.wav_ASR	and then after the after the the the the the the prince said there's only one person interested in it
65-1_1535.789_2.93.wav_ASR	and it was the gallophath left the glass slipper behind
65-1_1538.769_9.72.wav_ASR	and and so the abracadabrao were sent out the kingdom to try and figure out who was that lady left a glass slipper behind
65-1_1549.451_11.43.wav_ASR	and and it was the the lady who's who would fit this this small glass slipper
65-1_1561.723_3.47.wav_ASR	and the stepsisters need one of the glass slippers
65-1_1565.701_3.72.wav_ASR	the cinderella's foot would fit in the slipper
65-1_1569.443_7.35.wav_ASR	and so she was i ended up as the prince wanted wanted to wanted to marry
65-1_1576.915_5.67.wav_ASR	and so the cinderella married the prince
65-1_1582.609_2.0.wav_ASR	and they lived happily ever
65-1_1595.381_4.76.wav_ASR	prefer preferably on on week bread
65-1_1600.8_8.05.wav_ASR	you would use a knife and and spread the spread the peanut butter on one side of the bread
65-1_1609.79_6.11.wav_ASR	but then on the other side of the other other other bread the optimal jelly is grape jelly
65-1_1617.339_1.5.wav_ASR	and then she'd take a spoon
65-1_1619.081_5.76.wav_ASR	and not night because he he kept up the the the the jelly in the jar
65-1_1624.893_6.9.wav_ASR	but you take your spoon and and spoon out the the the grape jelly on the other piece of bread
65-1_1632.163_2.41.wav_ASR	you used the knife spread out straight across
65-1_1634.597_2.32.wav_ASR	and then put the two halves together
65-1_1636.935_3.5.wav_ASR	and you got the olive peanut butter and jelly sandwich
65-2_8.167_1.85.wav_ASR	pieces of bread
65-2_10.563_0.77.wav_ASR	much improved
65-2_12.338_9.08.wav_ASR	the the holding of speech surgery as least than it did
65-2_22.185_23.08.wav_ASR	the what happens is that the the what happens is that the the the accident to tell a story or something like that i will may do it in the most base form and and think later
65-2_45.514_1.3.wav_ASR	hey i shoulda said this
65-2_46.935_0.67.wav_ASR	they coulda said that
65-2_48.111_1.09.wav_ASR	why why didn't i say
65-2_49.95_6.53.wav_ASR	if applicable in a public school system an opportunity with a doctor if there's some kind of contract with a car
65-2_57.16_5.08.wav_ASR	it helps eventually if i think about it before a day or so
65-2_62.323_26.47.wav_ASR	and until i see it before the the the the the the left right or the the the the the the the the left is spinned and thinking about it and considering all of the most extensive
65-2_89.557_8.62.wav_ASR	and it is i'll i'll after i get home i'd have a headache
65-2_98.79_1.57.wav_ASR	why why didn't i think that before
65-2_100.765_5.64.wav_ASR	if before before my eighteen i would've thought of that meeting me anyway
65-2_107.061_5.26.wav_ASR	but it's much more difficult to and take so long than it did
65-2_112.37_1.84.wav_ASR	and that's it's like i said
65-2_114.233_1.4.wav_ASR	been that way for thirty six years
65-2_127.18_6.21.wav_ASR	the first one was a tv show at an international
65-2_134.294_2.7.wav_ASR	and and ended up being
65-2_137.011_6.39.wav_ASR	and i i caught the a whole internal heart in the driveway side door
65-2_144.01_12.54.wav_ASR	and had a chaperone plastic scarf a a baseball skull fragment off the right forehead toward the left ear
65-2_157.19_1.61.wav_ASR	did i say hungry lunch
65-2_159.526_1.7.wav_ASR	seventeen years ago
65-2_161.937_1.51.wav_ASR	hey firstnamei wish you could come over
65-2_164.72_6.62.wav_ASR	and in in i at coma for three and a half weeks
65-2_172.132_7.28.wav_ASR	hospital probably probably about two and a half months
65-2_180.19_6.53.wav_ASR	and three child was born three days after i moved out of siu
65-2_190.003_8.12.wav_ASR	and the second one was february nineteenth nineteen ninety eight i'd have my car walk across the table in an ambulance
65-2_199.113_2.48.wav_ASR	it was a shirley philippina on the left side
65-2_202.563_6.32.wav_ASR	and and i i believe that i was unconscious forever
65-2_209.678_1.66.wav_ASR	well i i guess i don't know how long
65-2_212.237_10.04.wav_ASR	but i recall walking across the street starting across the street and seeing the corner of the car in front of me
65-2_223.056_2.51.wav_ASR	and then i had the the sense being spunged around
65-2_226.386_7.17.wav_ASR	and then later like a say i i i first remember things maybe
65-2_234.386_0.46.wav_ASR	and i don't know
65-2_234.865_0.96.wav_ASR	twenty minutes later
65-2_236.459_2.59.wav_ASR	and i i was in a group meeting
65-2_239.878_5.52.wav_ASR	and i was in a wonderful mood because the eighty four inches last time before the accident
65-2_246.349_7.14.wav_ASR	and at this one fifteen nineteen ninety eight i knew exactly where i was doing what happened
65-2_254.174_2.51.wav_ASR	and i was in a really great place
65-2_257.551_13.19.wav_ASR	and then say a brain injury because i think it was about one day or two days later i developed a a double vision
65-2_271.809_19.88.wav_ASR	that was that was the most excessive pain in the leg from that the not knowing if the damage would ever go away was a most concerning if you
65-2_292.55_3.94.wav_ASR	and it did finally go away when the brain stroke went down
65-2_296.863_0.66.wav_ASR	finally woke up
65-2_297.627_3.16.wav_ASR	but i would probably three four or five
65-2_303.117_1.68.wav_ASR	the last i suggested i forget about it a time
65-2_305.602_7.65.wav_ASR	and and the doctors could not tell me whether it'd ever go away
65-2_313.306_5.33.wav_ASR	it was already necessary pain
65-2_318.652_8.33.wav_ASR	and i recall that the orthopedic guy that stuck a pin in my my tube said
65-2_327.006_12.71.wav_ASR	oh after after after three or four months when the all the the fish he said
65-2_340.67_4.18.wav_ASR	oh you know that's probably the most important ingredient you need to man
65-2_345.576_0.85.wav_ASR	oh okay
65-2_346.527_1.96.wav_ASR	yeah what does me a big baby there
65-2_349.558_1.88.wav_ASR	and he he he he took it
65-2_353.552_2.83.wav_ASR	that's kind of it
65-2_356.478_4.01.wav_ASR	that those are the two actions in at at at at at at at a top level
65-2_372.985_7.65.wav_ASR	we went to west tennessee going into my apartment going into my apartment
65-2_399.4_12.1.wav_ASR	the after the first eight four inches when i did not know
65-2_411.553_17.22.wav_ASR	what happened was at the eighty four laps where you fell by by by my my my company
65-2_429.508_17.32.wav_ASR	and and my my boss at that time i sent set set one down for me to do
65-2_447.04_0.75.wav_ASR	oh i'll call it tomorrow
65-2_449.397_1.27.wav_ASR	and we'd say we'd stay right with it
65-2_450.939_2.51.wav_ASR	but learned how to use their their home
65-2_454.232_6.24.wav_ASR	and of course before the this before the way eighty four and and those kinda things
65-2_460.758_11.03.wav_ASR	but i i've been doing nassau in which is a strength analysis work for the company for quite a long time
65-2_472.499_9.05.wav_ASR	and but that was all on ivac a a punch card or or a debit card computer
65-2_482.344_4.62.wav_ASR	and so here is a a simple little lamp out of there
65-2_486.979_1.14.wav_ASR	how i remember not to use it
65-2_488.329_4.44.wav_ASR	and so my boss brought his ladder down down there
65-2_492.784_4.6.wav_ASR	and in those years there was a a user man that came along with them
65-2_498.448_4.81.wav_ASR	and so tried to use a a computer computer voice assistant
65-2_503.994_7.47.wav_ASR	if you're read a microphone of any kind they are extra difficult
65-2_512.342_14.661.wav_ASR	and one of the one thing in picture three was was was proper when it said to second something
65-2_528.184_0.51.wav_ASR	second
65-2_528.839_12.43.wav_ASR	well have never had any trouble in in a a a lab or medicock or what what did select me
65-2_542.262_6.07.wav_ASR	and and after several days of trying out what select me so that select me
65-2_548.888_1.04.wav_ASR	but there's also aphasia
65-2_550.399_0.6.wav_ASR	it's like me
65-2_551.438_0.49.wav_ASR	and aphasia
65-2_552.509_5.58.wav_ASR	as long as they met by second i couldn't figure it out
65-2_558.551_0.56.wav_ASR	it could
65-2_559.312_1.04.wav_ASR	there was no way
65-2_560.944_2.31.wav_ASR	and unfortunately trouble really bothered me
65-2_564.422_5.97.wav_ASR	and so so finally i called a coworker and said
65-2_570.608_3.88.wav_ASR	what what do they what does this mean when they say sick
65-2_575.568_7.44.wav_ASR	and to drive the hit tap in the car and moving the cursor along the corner and moving the cursor down and hiding in there
65-2_583.899_1.23.wav_ASR	that's what they met by themselves
65-2_585.777_2.95.wav_ASR	well hell that was never described in the manual at all
65-2_589.857_3.86.wav_ASR	and that that really that threw me for a loop forever
65-2_594.838_7.3.wav_ASR	and so i became very quashing as weather weather i could go back to work even functioning as well
65-2_603.43_5.21.wav_ASR	and so so finally the they'd tip from the cooker
65-2_609.025_0.57.wav_ASR	okay
65-2_609.645_8.98.wav_ASR	so it was most bastic of terms which the the dog man
65-2_619.047_2.1.wav_ASR	but i know that this dog's not my son's son
65-2_621.166_1.3.wav_ASR	because before my surgery existed
65-2_623.365_14.01.wav_ASR	as dogsman it did not do not count as somebody that would have the the the gall and stuff to contain them meep and stuff to consume them meep
65-2_638.605_1.01.wav_ASR	they did not fit
65-2_640.35_2.3.wav_ASR	the disease didn't drive at anywhere
65-2_643.738_14.19.wav_ASR	and so so i went back to work and stuck with the aphasia and short term issues and the function
65-2_658.457_15.64.wav_ASR	and and finally my my after a couple years the county brought out to what they called a franken plant and and said
65-2_675.07_5.2.wav_ASR	you might have to take the frankincillin and then stuff stuff down
65-2_681.229_2.47.wav_ASR	and so while that was a godsend
65-2_684.72_2.15.wav_ASR	we're just being able to write right right now
65-2_686.892_1.67.wav_ASR	so i carry a small
65-2_689.233_0.96.wav_ASR	and i'd wait right now
65-2_690.968_8.11.wav_ASR	so i carry small note card the small note card with a day
65-2_699.671_10.58.wav_ASR	that that was when my my boss feeling when i figured out when my front step down with a front step down the front of my car
65-2_710.85_7.47.wav_ASR	the whole apple that was not new new new life on you
65-2_719.266_2.66.wav_ASR	that that affected me
65-2_721.95_17.32.wav_ASR	and also i ended up as a cancer patient for a couple of months
65-2_739.905_10.88.wav_ASR	when i meet somebody who i meet somebody new i will always say their name over and over again so to myself
65-2_751.358_5.4.wav_ASR	he used their name in any kind of vehicle to communicate with them
65-2_757.276_2.99.wav_ASR	you useta name every five or six names or almost
65-2_760.315_4.68.wav_ASR	and and after after the conference right next door to
65-2_766.354_8.45.wav_ASR	and and that that is a a wildfire that i i still use today
65-2_775.921_2.94.wav_ASR	her apartment i met in her neighborhood
65-2_779.492_1.18.wav_ASR	yeah i'm at home
65-2_781.203_0.98.wav_ASR	don't down the farm
65-2_782.926_11.55.wav_ASR	but met a fellow named named the neighborooda of several days ago and and he moved to the neighborhood some time back
65-2_794.526_1.25.wav_ASR	and i got his name
65-2_795.797_6.87.wav_ASR	and then set his name over and the like his name over again and the like it down there
65-2_803.378_7.6.wav_ASR	and this morning i saw him out of walk and and couldn't call nine one one at a while
65-2_810.996_1.51.wav_ASR	and then finally finally came through
65-2_813.742_14.39.wav_ASR	so but the the the condition on on controlling names is quite quite quite quite and help me to reorganize information
65-2_839.375_0.52.wav_ASR	yes
65-2_840.697_4.78.wav_ASR	the i think i mentioned to you a last week
65-2_846.085_1.32.wav_ASR	and i made a mistake
65-2_847.746_4.92.wav_ASR	time i spent my time as at the rehab hospital in venice florida as a volunteer over seven
65-2_853.54_6.13.wav_ASR	and because i started over with twenty years after the eighty four injuries
65-2_860.446_8.79.wav_ASR	and it became necessary to me because having they just didn't do therapy for the brain injury in those years
65-2_869.993_1.69.wav_ASR	so there was no therapy
65-2_871.699_1.97.wav_ASR	you just he are able to survive
65-2_873.684_3.67.wav_ASR	but if you're able to just do your homework go through
65-2_878.184_5.53.wav_ASR	and because they did therapy in those years
65-2_883.737_16.3.wav_ASR	and over the course of twenty years the why and i found out about from people at hawthorne is later that the a divorce lawyer might've pointed out about from people that the divorce attorney probably ninety percent
65-2_901.056_3.61.wav_ASR	and the suu i'd hadta bring it over is four to five times a week
65-2_905.719_4.72.wav_ASR	as what they're telling people even fifteen years ago
65-2_911.291_15.93.wav_ASR	and so i wanted to share that with patients at archd6 just to give them hope that that recovery is is possible as possible
65-2_928.404_1.38.wav_ASR	and it years take a long time
65-2_930.61_10.94.wav_ASR	and over four when i started there're your guys it was i heard neurosurgeons telling patients and their families
65-2_942.297_1.58.wav_ASR	yeah a year after that
65-2_944.156_1.01.wav_ASR	here a year and a half
65-2_945.302_0.94.wav_ASR	here you are after careful
65-2_947.407_3.51.wav_ASR	hey you don't stop recovering
65-2_950.937_7.04.wav_ASR	the rate maybe asthma if you will and slow down right after a a year or a half
65-2_958.775_1.9.wav_ASR	you never never stopped recovering
65-2_961.454_7.72.wav_ASR	in the eighties i had a a dead pot with no feeding about the left
65-2_970.136_2.65.wav_ASR	and there's just something that i encountered
65-2_972.842_1.73.wav_ASR	and there was like hooks out of it
65-2_974.655_0.98.wav_ASR	you know no big deal
65-2_975.956_3.16.wav_ASR	so take a pen there and do a few
65-2_979.96_1.4.wav_ASR	don't no bad deal
65-2_981.865_4.86.wav_ASR	and then it was probably five years ago or maybe twenty
65-2_987.413_0.4.wav_ASR	and they think he's here
65-2_987.879_0.74.wav_ASR	and they was okay
65-2_989.309_5.7.wav_ASR	twenty five years after the eighty four minutes i was in the bed and put in my sock one morning
65-2_996.424_4.47.wav_ASR	and i had feeling in the spot that had no feeling for twenty five years
65-2_1002.063_12.36.wav_ASR	so what i'm telling actually is that the recovery may still down like a m s but still slow down significantly
65-2_1014.632_2.9.wav_ASR	but still he never stopped recovering
65-2_1017.689_1.16.wav_ASR	you didn't have to bother me about it
65-2_1019.52_6.059.wav_ASR	and i i didn't react
65-2_1068.805_3.42.wav_ASR	yes yeah it's not right as i did
65-2_1072.242_7.48.wav_ASR	just type time time is the best you are your vali and in those kind of cases
65-2_1080.467_7.98.wav_ASR	because you you the feeling that you don't have it will lengthen in importance
65-2_1088.535_2.52.wav_ASR	and and you'll notice one day you know
65-2_1091.749_2.26.wav_ASR	oh i i feel there didn't have before
65-2_1094.551_1.56.wav_ASR	but actually it will happen
65-2_1096.384_0.98.wav_ASR	you will experience that
65-2_1108.416_2.63.wav_ASR	actually didn't know
65-2_1111.095_6.75.wav_ASR	it was it just like a little peanut butter every week
65-2_1118.126_4.87.wav_ASR	but i i don't know if i got used to it or unaware of it
65-2_1124.138_3.5.wav_ASR	but like olie five five years later just put on the socks one morning
65-2_1128.17_0.83.wav_ASR	wait wait a minute
65-2_1129.343_1.05.wav_ASR	and i got feeling there
65-2_1131.24_2.06.wav_ASR	and hit head had none before
65-2_1134.534_0.63.wav_ASR	and i wouldn't happen
65-2_1135.397_0.91.wav_ASR	and i haven't no idea
65-2_1149.083_1.64.wav_ASR	they will it will they will
65-2_1150.924_0.87.wav_ASR	so a nurse was working
65-2_1151.84_1.31.wav_ASR	and they they will ask me
65-2_1153.17_0.46.wav_ASR	they will
65-2_1173.169_4.87.wav_ASR	when when i first first met my wife
65-2_1179.585_5.52.wav_ASR	when when we we highway crosses
65-2_1185.345_2.45.wav_ASR	we went to different hospitals again
65-2_1188.603_5.09.wav_ASR	her from in near washingindiana and washingindiana indiana
65-2_1193.708_1.47.wav_ASR	but myself from a plane field
65-2_1195.197_4.75.wav_ASR	and it was before class started at pdu
65-2_1200.599_1.59.wav_ASR	autobios and nineteen seventy two
65-2_1203.067_4.66.wav_ASR	it was her first chance in campus
65-2_1208.447_1.29.wav_ASR	my first day in campus
65-2_1210.419_10.65.wav_ASR	there was to be a a dance at the the door i was standing at this this this night at
65-2_1221.089_2.26.wav_ASR	again again it's as far before i can communicate
65-2_1224.373_5.17.wav_ASR	and and and and and and and i was a little bit ill
65-2_1229.596_7.78.wav_ASR	what i i will arrive at place a little bit early given given control of of the situation
65-2_1238.004_3.79.wav_ASR	so i ended up being just a little bit farther from the downtown there
65-2_1242.551_5.71.wav_ASR	and and my wife and and her her her wif
65-2_1248.927_1.99.wav_ASR	my girlfriend girl girl's going with bodyguard
65-2_1251.625_0.36.wav_ASR	and he said
65-2_1252.36_7.75.wav_ASR	her wif and her a young man shot up there at this this place
65-2_1260.78_3.88.wav_ASR	and san diego his wife was never a stranger
65-2_1265.396_2.78.wav_ASR	they she is a a a tree expert
65-2_1268.95_2.08.wav_ASR	how i look in wister accent as well
65-2_1272.802_5.88.wav_ASR	but anyway so she and her girl walked up to me and said
65-2_1278.901_2.74.wav_ASR	he is the the dentist here
65-2_1281.66_2.44.wav_ASR	yeah well i answered
65-2_1284.355_0.44.wav_ASR	it was too big
65-2_1284.946_0.71.wav_ASR	that's why i meet you
65-2_1285.671_4.64.wav_ASR	and and we i just i heard about it
65-2_1290.557_3.4.wav_ASR	and i ran her that that dance
65-2_1294.796_2.28.wav_ASR	and that's where we started dating
65-2_1297.1_3.94.wav_ASR	and we'd stay there probably maybe three days
65-2_1301.09_1.27.wav_ASR	they didn't know about three years ago
65-2_1303.312_4.59.wav_ASR	and after about four years figured out that well maybe something was going on here
65-2_1307.917_1.44.wav_ASR	and i gotta get more serious about this
65-2_1310.334_6.28.wav_ASR	so it was just like i i kept her up at at at a school dance
65-2_1317.648_2.02.wav_ASR	that's where where where firstnamem she picked me up in the day
65-2_1359.514_5.59.wav_ASR	and a young boy's gotta like a a grapefruit is had a soccer
65-2_1365.124_0.54.wav_ASR	so i'll keep me in it
65-2_1366.388_2.61.wav_ASR	and he he ends up going through the window
65-2_1369.723_9.4.wav_ASR	the gentleman on a couch there in the window as stayed right by where the soccer ball comes through and knocks his lamp down and surprises him
65-2_1379.989_6.19.wav_ASR	and then he he gets the ball stays by the broken window trying to find out which went off
65-2_1402.182_12.63.wav_ASR	and they beginning this this mother it appears as has a umbrella and wanted to give it to her son before he goes off to school or go somewhere
65-2_1415.551_2.24.wav_ASR	and he he says
65-2_1418.288_0.93.wav_ASR	and he says no and says
65-2_1419.62_0.77.wav_ASR	you don't know why i'm eating
65-2_1421.306_1.08.wav_ASR	and then leave
65-2_1422.451_2.41.wav_ASR	and then in the middle he started raining on him
65-2_1425.438_1.43.wav_ASR	and then rain heavy on me
65-2_1426.933_7.19.wav_ASR	and and then he goes back home just spoke to the bone as with mother kind of framing at
65-2_1434.453_6.25.wav_ASR	and then after the end of the story was he learned his lesson and has the umbrella with him as well
65-2_1455.01_13.73.wav_ASR	the way this started was that it looks like there is a a a male at the base of the tree a a a male at the front of the tree
65-2_1469.12_2.18.wav_ASR	the dog is barking at this guy
65-2_1471.974_7.79.wav_ASR	and on the tree limb there's a cat with a collar down below this cat
65-2_1480.206_6.04.wav_ASR	and it would appear that a cat climbed up the tree
65-2_1487.152_3.15.wav_ASR	the little girls climbed up the tree and got stuck up there
65-2_1491.016_10.21.wav_ASR	they they by male a man was either been chased up the tree by the little little girl cat
65-2_1501.878_3.4.wav_ASR	it was also a firetruck in a fire engine
65-2_1506.838_1.32.wav_ASR	the fire department is carrying a ladder
65-2_1508.684_7.57.wav_ASR	and looks like the ladder is being used by the firemen to rescue either the the man or the cat or both
65-2_1517.004_11.24.wav_ASR	and and they a strong bird is over in a a a road tree just singing away just expecting the old old stroke
65-2_1528.296_3.07.wav_ASR	alright
65-2_1754.983_9.4.wav_ASR	and cinderella was a the daughter of a king who
65-2_1764.522_2.45.wav_ASR	and she her mother had passed away
65-2_1767.818_1.36.wav_ASR	and his father remarried
65-2_1769.925_8.29.wav_ASR	and the stepmother had two two daughters who were mistreated
65-2_1778.914_21.3.wav_ASR	and as after they were married the the stepmother and stepmother married cinderella or around the house where stepdaughters were did did basically nothing
65-2_1801.139_8.38.wav_ASR	and so cinderella spent her time working cleaning with that kind of stuff around the house
65-2_1810.138_10.22.wav_ASR	and in that in the kingdom there was a a a prince who not married
65-2_1821.196_18.68.wav_ASR	and an associate to the king section a a a ball be held with his his son expecting express express in the kingdom
65-2_1840.902_3.19.wav_ASR	so the word was put out about the ball coming up
65-2_1844.858_6.3.wav_ASR	and cinderella was really happy about the ball coming coming coming up as the stepsisters
65-2_1851.712_16.43.wav_ASR	and so the the the firemen's firemen for cinderella for the ball
65-2_1868.918_10.26.wav_ASR	and and then at the last minute the stepmother told cinderella she was not going to the ball
65-2_1879.2_8.54.wav_ASR	and and also the stepdaughters were were really really mean to her
65-2_1888.574_2.81.wav_ASR	and so so the stepdaughters went to the ball
65-2_1892.097_14.38.wav_ASR	and but before before the ball a cinderella showed before before the ball they cinderella showed up and and said that
65-2_1906.5_5.6.wav_ASR	and so it it made her a just a lovely gown
65-2_1912.863_16.73.wav_ASR	and they turned a pumpkin into a coach pulled by by my mile i believe that was at end in the horses
65-2_1930.594_4.29.wav_ASR	and so she ended up going to the ball
65-2_1935.637_15.69.wav_ASR	and the prince was went with the stepmother and and everybody around there and everyone around there and only hit off with cinderella
65-2_1951.795_2.29.wav_ASR	and depending on the night dancing with the cinderella
65-2_1954.409_7.13.wav_ASR	but her godmother told cinderella that that he hafta be home by midnight because this all all ended at midnight
65-2_1962.363_5.08.wav_ASR	and so the the the prince and cinderella were dancing at midnight
65-2_1967.926_1.87.wav_ASR	and then in ten minutes
65-2_1970.219_0.31.wav_ASR	oh no
65-2_1970.547_6.69.wav_ASR	and then runs runs out of the right line leaving a glass slipper behind
65-2_1978.161_9.82.wav_ASR	and and as she's being driven back home the the coach turned back into a pumpkin
65-2_1988.0_2.49.wav_ASR	and the the horse turned back into the mice
65-2_1990.617_5.26.wav_ASR	and in the horseman's back in the horse and or or a dog
65-2_1996.13_0.56.wav_ASR	and i'm all wet
65-2_1997.231_3.15.wav_ASR	and then so it was over
65-2_2000.401_10.91.wav_ASR	and and then after the ball the the prince decided that there was only eleven this cinderella he was interested in
65-2_2012.653_3.04.wav_ASR	and nobody knew cinderella was and could not find her
65-2_2016.419_10.69.wav_ASR	and so he he put his eye out to the test of trying to locate cinderella with a glass slipper that that she left behind
65-2_2027.888_3.08.wav_ASR	and came to cinderella's house
65-2_2031.017_3.76.wav_ASR	the they stepped by not fit the the stepsisters
65-2_2035.46_4.69.wav_ASR	and but turned out it did fit cinderella
65-2_2041.079_9.609.wav_ASR	and so so it ended up being that cinderella and the prince got together and lived happily ever
65-2_2063.239_2.41.wav_ASR	we have two slices of bread
65-2_2066.402_6.391.wav_ASR	you hadta grease the peanut butter and jelly and have a knife or or spoon
65-2_2073.536_1.341.wav_ASR	they laid out two pieces of bread
65-2_2075.728_3.94.wav_ASR	spread the peanut butter on one of the pieces of bread
65-2_2080.572_5.141.wav_ASR	and then you spread the jelly on the other piece of bread
65-2_2086.377_2.24.wav_ASR	and then you put the pieces of bread together
65-2_2088.635_2.25.wav_ASR	and there you have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich
richardson16a_10.7_4.51.wav_ASR	stroke goes right
richardson16a_17.87_12.8.wav_ASR	hey i i don't talk a lot as sent is the stroke
richardson16a_31.22_5.93.wav_ASR	so i don't get lost in trying to think of something

tcu07a_241.134_0.35.wav_ASR	and i don't know
tcu07a_244.801_0.45.wav_ASR	okay
tcu07a_252.532_0.39.wav_ASR	he did
tcu07a_252.946_1.09.wav_ASR	okay so
tcu07a_261.678_10.64.wav_ASR	well they've been going into the
tcu07a_275.306_3.41.wav_ASR	and the
tcu07a_278.941_5.81.wav_ASR	they offered every three days they help me
tcu07a_284.77_5.06.wav_ASR	and they're in the they they live with him
tcu07a_289.849_2.0.wav_ASR	they do the everything
tcu07a_292.232_6.95.wav_ASR	and i could talk over three days of the again
tcu07a_299.2_1.1.wav_ASR	and they called nine one one
tcu07a_300.459_2.54.wav_ASR	and i talked and talked and talked
tcu07a_303.189_9.4.wav_ASR	so i do find out feel that when i go with my band that it helps something
tcu07a_312.787_1.43.wav_ASR	you know i find myself
tcu07a_314.811_3.77.wav_ASR	it seems every time i do it more a little more you know
tcu07a_318.6_0.53.wav_ASR	so
tcu07a_320.674_0.42.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
tcu07a_322.153_0.55.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
tcu07a_358.045_6.12.wav_ASR	and the didn't fit them but you know
tcu07a_365.261_1.33.wav_ASR	yeah man
tcu07a_367.6_2.3.wav_ASR	but it's hard to think of the
tcu07a_370.3_3.58.wav_ASR	and i said
tcu07a_374.981_1.26.wav_ASR	yeah probably
tcu07a_378.643_0.4.wav_ASR	and yeah
tcu07a_386.09_0.55.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
tcu07a_387.006_0.82.wav_ASR	that a good one

tcu07a_391.301_5.4.wav_ASR	and he he gives me a lot of help
tcu07a_396.719_2.71.wav_ASR	and i mean he hadn't helped him at all
tcu07a_401.411_5.31.wav_ASR	but they kept a lot of time for me
tcu07a_408.237_4.18.wav_ASR	and he was saying
tcu07a_413.77_2.46.wav_ASR	and i don't think what else i can do about it
tcu07a_422.86_7.74.wav_ASR	well i don't know if i can get him
tcu07a_431.851_1.14.wav_ASR	henry and lady
tcu07a_433.5_4.17.wav_ASR	it's it it is hard to to bind things
tcu07a_437.686_2.63.wav_ASR	so it's hard to talk a lot of things
tcu07a_440.368_3.96.wav_ASR	so i don't think you could
tcu07a_445.416_6.7.wav_ASR	and i know that i don't know there i know they but i don't know
tcu07a_454.244_1.07.wav_ASR	they it's funny

tcu07a_574.061_11.43.wav_ASR	the was gave gave gave it and found out what was going on
tcu07a_585.595_0.57.wav_ASR	and yeah
tcu07a_591.788_0.35.wav_ASR	okay
tcu07a_601.0_0.36.wav_ASR	okay
tcu07a_602.696_0.46.wav_ASR	okay
tcu07a_603.992_8.79.wav_ASR	there was a mother and her her kid
tcu07a_615.423_20.75.wav_ASR	and he was giving her told her to take the she to the the god given told her to to the the god give it
tcu07a_637.149_2.45.wav_ASR	and so
tcu07a_642.247_0.35.wav_ASR	and he says
tcu07a_642.854_1.48.wav_ASR	we don't need it
tcu07a_645.573_10.02.wav_ASR	and so he hadta go go go go
tcu07a_656.225_7.02.wav_ASR	and he stood and realized that he needed it
tcu07a_663.668_10.2.wav_ASR	so he got the thing from mom
tcu07a_674.299_13.15.wav_ASR	and and now he got me he he got a thing now
tcu07a_705.629_0.55.wav_ASR	okay
tcu07a_706.919_0.66.wav_ASR	and there's
tcu07a_709.213_4.84.wav_ASR	he he is drenched drenched
tcu07a_714.105_3.62.wav_ASR	he's barking barking
tcu07a_718.686_2.0.wav_ASR	and he is
tcu07a_722.226_6.54.wav_ASR	he was had his den in me he had his den up
tcu07a_729.621_0.69.wav_ASR	and he fell
tcu07a_730.508_2.92.wav_ASR	or he's his thing for me
tcu07a_734.264_6.18.wav_ASR	so now he's up here in the by himself
tcu07a_741.603_4.92.wav_ASR	and so he somebody called nine one one
tcu07a_747.232_5.05.wav_ASR	and so now he's he man is coming up
tcu07a_752.706_2.87.wav_ASR	and they're gonna get the the
tcu07a_756.359_2.18.wav_ASR	and i did the thing up
tcu07a_759.12_5.13.wav_ASR	so he can take his umbrella
tcu07a_766.256_4.05.wav_ASR	but the reason even he was on here the
tcu07a_771.091_5.47.wav_ASR	he was because she wanted to help her
tcu07a_777.474_8.41.wav_ASR	with the dog and man
tcu07a_786.29_0.77.wav_ASR	can't think of it
tcu07a_788.525_7.26.wav_ASR	and and that's how waited the anywhere
tcu07a_796.339_5.59.wav_ASR	but ended up he'd needta be the one that was in
tcu07a_803.428_0.37.wav_ASR	okay
tcu07a_810.884_0.43.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
tcu07a_817.503_0.34.wav_ASR	yeah
tcu07a_822.929_1.62.wav_ASR	we mind yourself of the deadline
tcu07a_824.817_0.32.wav_ASR	and yeah
tcu07a_829.258_0.31.wav_ASR	okay
tcu07a_832.777_0.33.wav_ASR	okay
tcu07a_923.902_0.54.wav_ASR	okay
tcu07a_932.792_1.57.wav_ASR	okay
tcu07a_936.625_3.32.wav_ASR	and she was a
tcu07a_943.222_1.11.wav_ASR	and he
tcu07a_947.118_4.63.wav_ASR	he she was a
tcu07a_955.779_0.59.wav_ASR	oh mean
tcu07a_956.619_4.65.wav_ASR	he was he was
tcu07a_969.306_4.23.wav_ASR	and in there her her her
tcu07a_974.209_3.69.wav_ASR	he did me
tcu07a_978.898_11.55.wav_ASR	they were all three gonna go to the dog to the go to the
tcu07a_991.517_2.85.wav_ASR	it was a dry
tcu07a_995.165_3.1.wav_ASR	and they wouldn't let her
tcu07a_999.781_0.87.wav_ASR	so they went
tcu07a_1001.665_2.88.wav_ASR	and he's in seaside heights
tcu07a_1004.567_11.65.wav_ASR	and her this lady her mother
tcu07a_1016.234_0.87.wav_ASR	yeah mail
tcu07a_1017.905_4.8.wav_ASR	and so she did a thing on him
tcu07a_1023.107_4.01.wav_ASR	and so he he he ran
tcu07a_1028.26_2.54.wav_ASR	and she could do it for herself
tcu07a_1031.136_3.36.wav_ASR	and then he he hadta get him out
tcu07a_1034.922_4.78.wav_ASR	because he would be able to to go back into the
tcu07a_1040.481_1.68.wav_ASR	he would change
tcu07a_1043.239_4.609.wav_ASR	so after that he left her
tcu07a_1051.113_2.61.wav_ASR	he lost her thing behind
tcu07a_1054.499_2.85.wav_ASR	so he he tried the button
tcu07a_1058.294_7.77.wav_ASR	and they hadta ta tad to everybody
tcu07a_1066.532_4.0.wav_ASR	and he finally found found found them
tcu07a_1070.549_1.74.wav_ASR	and she was one of them
tcu07a_1072.994_5.63.wav_ASR	and they were in forever
tcu07a_1078.898_1.38.wav_ASR	okay okay
tcu07a_1090.586_7.4.wav_ASR	and i would get the
tcu07a_1102.225_1.53.wav_ASR	oh no why are you here
tcu07a_1104.859_11.83.wav_ASR	we get the two two things of of bread bread yeah

thompson04a_465.565_1.68.wav_ASR	it has been terrible
thompson04a_475.274_2.86.wav_ASR	and and i mean terrible
thompson04a_478.653_0.69.wav_ASR	everything
thompson04a_479.521_1.46.wav_ASR	and i don't like any of it
thompson04a_485.534_4.43.wav_ASR	but you you do right here anyway
thompson04a_489.984_0.8.wav_ASR	you gotta do it
thompson04a_492.098_0.6.wav_ASR	and i don't know
thompson04a_494.928_0.34.wav_ASR	let's see
thompson04a_505.061_0.48.wav_ASR	what
thompson04a_511.001_1.49.wav_ASR	oh i got a lot so
thompson04a_514.072_4.77.wav_ASR	oh i like them all
thompson04a_520.23_0.61.wav_ASR	he kicked it
thompson04a_521.855_0.49.wav_ASR	yeah
thompson04a_523.121_0.73.wav_ASR	probably
thompson04a_526.29_10.82.wav_ASR	and eight inches no seed
thompson04a_538.978_4.14.wav_ASR	hotel
thompson04a_544.486_0.78.wav_ASR	and that's what it is
thompson04a_545.343_1.02.wav_ASR	and that's what it is
thompson04a_547.259_5.14.wav_ASR	one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven
thompson04a_553.999_0.56.wav_ASR	eat
thompson04a_556.035_5.43.wav_ASR	and i lived
thompson04a_566.895_0.53.wav_ASR	about it
thompson04a_568.405_0.57.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
thompson04a_569.401_0.9.wav_ASR	and that was strange
thompson04a_573.076_1.59.wav_ASR	so that's what i did a lot of times
thompson04a_580.365_2.42.wav_ASR	we did a lot of hikes
thompson04a_582.994_2.22.wav_ASR	we really did lots of that right
thompson04a_585.618_0.47.wav_ASR	we did
thompson04a_587.656_1.85.wav_ASR	and we had good times
thompson04a_625.168_6.19.wav_ASR	well fast do is is a ball
thompson04a_632.063_10.18.wav_ASR	and it's shoes
thompson04a_645.671_1.2.wav_ASR	and it's that's not it
thompson04a_647.082_1.51.wav_ASR	should be right right
thompson04a_648.774_1.69.wav_ASR	yeah right
thompson04a_651.582_1.04.wav_ASR	but that's what he says
thompson04a_652.643_2.25.wav_ASR	and he's going to go over to the window
thompson04a_655.361_8.78.wav_ASR	and then it goes back into the to the the butter
thompson04a_664.827_1.97.wav_ASR	well i say yes
thompson04a_667.577_2.7.wav_ASR	and the butter it is come back here
thompson04a_670.524_1.18.wav_ASR	and then that's it
thompson04a_671.933_5.95.wav_ASR	and this is where he is exactly with the ball
thompson04a_678.822_4.29.wav_ASR	and right here on his thinks
thompson04a_683.506_0.58.wav_ASR	and he says
thompson04a_685.979_1.15.wav_ASR	it's that's wonderful
thompson04a_689.329_0.47.wav_ASR	you know
thompson04a_690.252_0.68.wav_ASR	never bad
thompson04a_690.951_0.73.wav_ASR	so right
thompson04a_718.06_5.55.wav_ASR	oh well then what she's done is what she's done now is get her her umbrella
thompson04a_723.947_1.69.wav_ASR	and she's going home
thompson04a_725.814_1.36.wav_ASR	help you to go that way
thompson04a_727.275_1.5.wav_ASR	and we tell a story
thompson04a_728.934_1.61.wav_ASR	yeah i'm just right here
thompson04a_730.629_3.16.wav_ASR	you don't really need it but i'll have it anyway
thompson04a_733.866_1.23.wav_ASR	so they're going to do
thompson04a_735.374_2.04.wav_ASR	and now oh boy
thompson04a_737.915_20.01.wav_ASR	here is the umbrella or the umbrella
thompson04a_759.78_2.56.wav_ASR	and now now they're really bad
thompson04a_762.358_4.75.wav_ASR	boy it's something from this one to this one
thompson04a_769.393_0.93.wav_ASR	and so he is like
thompson04a_770.372_0.9.wav_ASR	it was bad
thompson04a_771.668_0.5.wav_ASR	oh my god
thompson04a_772.85_3.03.wav_ASR	he knew that he knew that he wasn't going to do it
thompson04a_776.376_1.28.wav_ASR	and that's what he did
thompson04a_777.764_3.69.wav_ASR	and now this time he's back with what
thompson04a_784.973_0.91.wav_ASR	it's not right
thompson04a_805.778_0.51.wav_ASR	oh my god
thompson04a_817.409_8.3.wav_ASR	well of course you've got the the cat
thompson04a_828.233_7.5.wav_ASR	and here is she tried to get back into get her to come back here
thompson04a_837.863_1.27.wav_ASR	and she needed help
thompson04a_839.181_2.29.wav_ASR	but that just stressed her out
thompson04a_842.118_0.86.wav_ASR	don't care that
thompson04a_846.898_0.57.wav_ASR	we do this
thompson04a_847.736_3.5.wav_ASR	and this is from him right here
thompson04a_851.912_1.56.wav_ASR	and he's got right here
thompson04a_854.836_1.25.wav_ASR	but it's terrible
thompson04a_857.845_1.0.wav_ASR	that's terrible
thompson04a_860.078_2.32.wav_ASR	and now we still have this one
thompson04a_864.425_1.38.wav_ASR	whatever he's got
thompson04a_867.696_6.0.wav_ASR	and here is his his his come up here
thompson04a_873.745_3.51.wav_ASR	and i don't know whether whether he's going to come here
thompson04a_880.516_2.44.wav_ASR	okay he would hafta come back here first

thompson04a_1289.102_0.69.wav_ASR	and it was
thompson04a_1292.985_2.57.wav_ASR	and could be such here
thompson04a_1296.055_0.38.wav_ASR	okay
thompson04a_1298.501_0.39.wav_ASR	okay
thompson04a_1309.763_2.27.wav_ASR	oh good good good good
thompson04a_1316.034_0.91.wav_ASR	well certainly
thompson04a_1324.377_3.66.wav_ASR	oh i think everybody else does that thing
thompson04a_1328.059_3.04.wav_ASR	yeah i i sprained yep
thompson04a_1351.601_0.4.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
thompson04a_1352.919_0.46.wav_ASR	and i don't know
thompson04a_1685.2_0.45.wav_ASR	oh
thompson04a_1687.735_11.25.wav_ASR	well this was the the little little cinderella
thompson04a_1700.423_8.07.wav_ASR	and she's been taking up the brushes everything like this does this take
thompson04a_1708.669_13.89.wav_ASR	and load in behind it's going to be a to destinations her destination heristers
thompson04a_1723.614_0.5.wav_ASR	you know
thompson04a_1747.467_0.66.wav_ASR	the little girl says
thompson04a_1750.144_3.34.wav_ASR	and the mother
thompson04a_1755.248_5.73.wav_ASR	and they were going to this up for this
thompson04a_1761.0_3.22.wav_ASR	and they're gonna have all this stuff for the things
thompson04a_1766.176_5.85.wav_ASR	and she was looking at the the things
thompson04a_1773.503_0.8.wav_ASR	and she loves him
thompson04a_1774.318_1.56.wav_ASR	oh no no no
thompson04a_1782.4_4.34.wav_ASR	and she was looking for the the dress
thompson04a_1786.938_15.74.wav_ASR	and then all of a sudden that was where they they went to the to the
thompson04a_1826.646_3.98.wav_ASR	me about about it and then these two right here
thompson04a_1831.59_4.61.wav_ASR	but this is cinderella
thompson04a_1843.36_0.8.wav_ASR	let me see
thompson04a_1848.737_1.66.wav_ASR	what go you do
thompson04a_1855.562_1.36.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
thompson04a_1861.631_0.49.wav_ASR	oh my god
thompson04a_1864.415_5.88.wav_ASR	boy boy ball
thompson04a_1871.666_0.43.wav_ASR	bird
thompson04a_1873.192_0.9.wav_ASR	and he hadta go
thompson04a_1874.255_1.48.wav_ASR	and that that they were
thompson04a_1876.295_12.54.wav_ASR	and they hadta stay and you saw him with with the cinderella
thompson04a_1890.277_9.22.wav_ASR	and then eventually everybody came in for the they they came in for the two sisters
thompson04a_1900.192_2.05.wav_ASR	and they had nothing nothing
thompson04a_1902.444_7.88.wav_ASR	and then suddenly clear back the things to the lock
thompson04a_1913.285_2.58.wav_ASR	and she came back in
thompson04a_1916.929_3.56.wav_ASR	put for her this things for the right here
thompson04a_1921.575_12.74.wav_ASR	and it was then that they got all of this together for the two sisters
thompson04a_1936.114_5.23.wav_ASR	and all and they got wonderful to get
thompson04a_1943.135_3.14.wav_ASR	they really don't think this is really going to mind things
thompson04a_1946.752_2.06.wav_ASR	really don't think it's going to do it
thompson04a_1949.304_0.86.wav_ASR	you're not to eat
thompson04a_1953.075_0.59.wav_ASR	yeah oh my god
thompson04a_1955.74_0.69.wav_ASR	and he says
thompson04a_1960.875_4.32.wav_ASR	well that's that's the boy that's a new word
thompson04a_1966.733_0.86.wav_ASR	and they lived happily ever
thompson04a_1969.225_2.6.wav_ASR	and you all didn't have anything to help
thompson04a_1972.089_4.73.wav_ASR	and then they had this one to get them they had those together
thompson04a_1976.918_1.61.wav_ASR	oh i saw them like this
thompson04a_1979.546_0.51.wav_ASR	so here
thompson04a_1980.08_0.65.wav_ASR	okay
thompson04a_1981.881_0.43.wav_ASR	and so
thompson04a_1983.803_0.98.wav_ASR	yeah i know
thompson04a_1984.798_0.8.wav_ASR	yeah yeah yeah
thompson04a_2002.117_11.38.wav_ASR	you know i guess what i would hafta do is have a a bread
thompson04a_2015.25_3.53.wav_ASR	and they'd hafta go back into the back in to this get them out
thompson04a_2018.801_1.79.wav_ASR	and then they get back together
thompson04a_2021.15_2.01.wav_ASR	and then they say right back here
thompson04a_2025.804_3.67.wav_ASR	they they go into the toilet
thompson04a_2031.163_4.17.wav_ASR	and they had good good good fit
thompson04a_2035.492_0.35.wav_ASR	and yeah
thompson04a_2036.692_0.51.wav_ASR	go
thompson04a_2042.043_0.49.wav_ASR	stroke
thompson04a_2089.601_0.341.wav_ASR	and he says
thompson04a_2090.117_1.359.wav_ASR	and she can't there
thompson04a_2092.252_0.46.wav_ASR	okay
thompson04a_2093.788_3.53.wav_ASR	and then they would have it right here
thompson04a_2097.728_1.52.wav_ASR	and and then they first
thompson04a_2101.221_1.23.wav_ASR	what what do you do
thompson04a_2102.58_5.8.wav_ASR	we hadta do the berries the the peanut butter
thompson04a_2108.838_1.47.wav_ASR	and then they would have
thompson04a_2113.759_1.53.wav_ASR	and i don't know why i wanted to do that
thompson04a_2116.369_3.57.wav_ASR	peanut butter
thompson04a_2120.865_3.46.wav_ASR	and then i hit the the jelly
thompson04a_2126.315_1.21.wav_ASR	and i think it's it
thompson04a_2128.62_0.83.wav_ASR	you know what i'm saying

tucson17a_977.377_8.79.wav_ASR	oh it's time to oh time to show
tucson17a_987.938_22.49.wav_ASR	and and when you slipper
tucson17a_1010.85_4.71.wav_ASR	and oh oh oh oh
tucson17a_1017.135_11.14.wav_ASR	and and and
tucson17a_1065.547_3.18.wav_ASR	yeah yes yes
tucson17a_1084.343_6.17.wav_ASR	herself fell the ladder and it fell
tucson17a_1091.135_8.71.wav_ASR	and send with two
tucson17a_1100.705_0.86.wav_ASR	okay
tucson17a_1102.921_9.95.wav_ASR	peanut butter and jelly
tucson17a_1115.13_0.54.wav_ASR	and yeah
tucson17a_1118.72_10.58.wav_ASR	oh that what that was a chicken plover and shellfish
UCL02a_6.639_0.36.wav_ASR	and yeah
UCL02a_11.585_0.35.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
UCL02a_13.404_4.57.wav_ASR	so just talk about my my speech and how it is today this week or
UCL02a_18.68_2.04.wav_ASR	what could you do to with a pen yeah
UCL02a_25.837_2.86.wav_ASR	my speech is still today
UCL02a_31.699_1.62.wav_ASR	and that was it
UCL02a_34.593_2.69.wav_ASR	how do you know
UCL02a_37.33_2.09.wav_ASR	so sometimes he's busy this morning isn't it
UCL02a_39.439_0.94.wav_ASR	everything was working well
UCL02a_40.4_0.93.wav_ASR	it's really isn't today
UCL02a_43.429_1.1.wav_ASR	and she could be good
UCL02a_44.544_1.86.wav_ASR	sometimes i can't out and talk
UCL02a_47.789_2.6.wav_ASR	and not here what's happening about me now
UCL02a_50.411_1.47.wav_ASR	can't
UCL02a_53.073_3.41.wav_ASR	you know these happen to me the big problem is sometimes one word is just gone
UCL02a_56.5_1.63.wav_ASR	and you know that that
UCL02a_58.449_1.89.wav_ASR	but i just took me out there now i can't remember
UCL02a_61.489_4.3.wav_ASR	some weeks i think i can hear about everything
UCL02a_66.983_3.54.wav_ASR	and i can hear everything
UCL02a_70.775_5.62.wav_ASR	and then suddenly it just disappears from me now
UCL02a_77.532_0.76.wav_ASR	it's hard to tell
UCL02a_78.308_2.25.wav_ASR	so sometimes one day he can be perfect
UCL02a_81.517_1.77.wav_ASR	well not perfect i mean it is difficult
UCL02a_83.309_5.47.wav_ASR	and then sometimes it's i just can't hear something you know
UCL02a_88.8_1.82.wav_ASR	that's a difficult thing when with the speech
UCL02a_92.492_4.69.wav_ASR	and then i told someone it's it's okay
UCL02a_97.24_3.13.wav_ASR	and then of course one word is just disappointing for me as well
UCL02a_100.812_1.34.wav_ASR	so i forgot about it
UCL02a_102.173_0.54.wav_ASR	that's okay
UCL02a_103.893_3.39.wav_ASR	and then suddenly one word is breaking to to speak everywhere
UCL02a_107.33_0.65.wav_ASR	and it's good for me
UCL02a_108.7_2.11.wav_ASR	and then suddenly just make me so tired
UCL02a_111.006_1.62.wav_ASR	we're not tied but then i just kinda here
UCL02a_112.82_1.55.wav_ASR	he's difficult to tell you
UCL02a_115.317_8.88.wav_ASR	yeah i wanna talk about wellco
UCL02a_124.218_1.15.wav_ASR	so nothing about me as well
UCL02a_125.597_8.35.wav_ASR	my drive many times about my speaking to everybody
UCL02a_134.03_3.34.wav_ASR	sometimes it's bright
UCL02a_137.419_4.91.wav_ASR	when people were talking to me and then i guess they're talking to me is
UCL02a_142.345_3.14.wav_ASR	and i think maybe one little word is is difficult me now
UCL02a_146.052_0.98.wav_ASR	one week is gone
UCL02a_147.699_2.65.wav_ASR	and then sometimes i can't hear anything
UCL02a_151.038_4.42.wav_ASR	and he tried to stay in there
UCL02a_155.949_12.23.wav_ASR	sometimes the bad thing is you you i can't do anything for me
UCL02a_168.2_1.91.wav_ASR	but that's that's bad bad making me feel sick too
UCL02a_171.11_1.02.wav_ASR	it's very difficult for me
UCL02a_172.344_1.12.wav_ASR	it was very difficult sometimes
UCL02a_173.565_1.16.wav_ASR	and when he really bad with us
UCL02a_175.216_2.16.wav_ASR	you can't speak to my eye
UCL02a_177.398_0.78.wav_ASR	and happened to me
UCL02a_178.199_1.64.wav_ASR	and that's very difficult because i thought
UCL02a_180.635_5.7.wav_ASR	and you get refreshing frost
UCL02a_186.35_0.66.wav_ASR	and i'm saying yeah
UCL02a_187.33_0.32.wav_ASR	so yeah
UCL02a_188.404_3.4.wav_ASR	well that can be terrible sometimes
UCL02a_192.01_4.9.wav_ASR	sometimes like
UCL02a_198.705_2.08.wav_ASR	didn't look about me outta speaking as well
UCL02a_200.83_1.55.wav_ASR	so sometimes i now read books
UCL02a_202.4_2.79.wav_ASR	so you hafta read things you know before i did my stroke okay
UCL02a_205.21_1.04.wav_ASR	but i read a book
UCL02a_206.693_3.1.wav_ASR	now is difficult for me as i speaking about my books to me
UCL02a_210.781_7.56.wav_ASR	and the overall thing for me something's i read some of my books about two pages in me and then i call nine one one
UCL02a_218.619_3.13.wav_ASR	so the half pages are reading about and then suddenly he says
UCL02a_222.2_2.17.wav_ASR	good years that i'm reading about at that time
UCL02a_224.65_1.38.wav_ASR	and then suddenly one brain healthy
UCL02a_226.05_0.43.wav_ASR	and she just goes
UCL02a_226.69_0.88.wav_ASR	it was terrible as well
UCL02a_228.468_4.2.wav_ASR	so many times when i'm talking again i can't what i'm talking about today
UCL02a_232.729_1.01.wav_ASR	so it's terrible you know
UCL02a_234.485_8.7.wav_ASR	yeah like me to be sure as well i'm watching films and things like that for me as well
UCL02a_243.916_13.13.wav_ASR	well watching films or tv d d d d v d d e s sometimes i hafta watch everything to to subtitles
UCL02a_258.261_9.22.wav_ASR	that's that's helped me as well saturday and the next day again or something like that
UCL02a_268.09_0.94.wav_ASR	so things are okay
UCL02a_269.046_0.67.wav_ASR	that's quite good
UCL02a_270.468_3.7.wav_ASR	because i can't what they're talking about
UCL02a_274.691_5.27.wav_ASR	snuts are really good for me almost as good as everything as well
UCL02a_282.717_3.23.wav_ASR	and of course what happened to me with my stroke as well
UCL02a_285.97_2.58.wav_ASR	you know i did a lot with cognitive medicine
UCL02a_288.565_1.94.wav_ASR	that was the consequence of
UCL02a_292.355_5.18.wav_ASR	that's the all the classic music places
UCL02a_297.553_2.03.wav_ASR	so i was living in germany and spain everything like that
UCL02a_299.599_4.57.wav_ASR	that was one of the things i was doing is me with me is that
UCL02a_305.791_4.38.wav_ASR	at least my my childhood is there thanksgiving
UCL02a_311.267_2.23.wav_ASR	but strange to me they happened to me
UCL02a_314.212_3.28.wav_ASR	and i could hear the words perfectly about them
UCL02a_317.508_1.67.wav_ASR	and all the sound of the music is that
UCL02a_319.2_1.21.wav_ASR	can i hear everything perfectly
UCL02a_320.824_0.96.wav_ASR	and then someone comes
UCL02a_322.053_0.66.wav_ASR	yeah he's that
UCL02a_323.079_2.0.wav_ASR	what i need to do is
UCL02a_325.1_0.75.wav_ASR	how i deal with it without
UCL02a_326.28_0.58.wav_ASR	but i couldn't say
UCL02a_327.06_3.92.wav_ASR	you know so so you'd have a bite and that outta there
UCL02a_331.0_0.95.wav_ASR	okay so i could see what that was
UCL02a_332.315_0.63.wav_ASR	and then suddenly
UCL02a_333.511_1.24.wav_ASR	oh yeah what is that big of base
UCL02a_334.876_1.23.wav_ASR	it was the panel i was playing with
UCL02a_336.218_1.82.wav_ASR	that's the one word is just gone from me
UCL02a_339.028_2.35.wav_ASR	you should get a potty about it
UCL02a_341.4_0.32.wav_ASR	and he says
UCL02a_341.803_0.93.wav_ASR	and they forgot his name
UCL02a_342.829_1.91.wav_ASR	you know i can remember the word up here
UCL02a_344.964_0.93.wav_ASR	can't handle all of it
UCL02a_347.417_4.47.wav_ASR	but the classical music is still hard for me as well
UCL02a_351.907_3.12.wav_ASR	and me too my medical there as you know
UCL02a_355.5_1.15.wav_ASR	so saying just now
UCL02a_357.482_1.78.wav_ASR	and reading the books could be difficult for me
UCL02a_360.193_2.99.wav_ASR	the fires i need the suction
UCL02a_363.263_3.04.wav_ASR	but then with the music it's really nice god i mean you know
UCL02a_367.126_5.98.wav_ASR	maybe things happened with me in my face yeah and things like that a couple of people was well
UCL02a_373.127_1.85.wav_ASR	and i mean i'm at a bit use as well
UCL02a_374.999_1.1.wav_ASR	so that helped speak as well
UCL02a_376.116_0.31.wav_ASR	and i says
UCL02a_376.48_0.38.wav_ASR	and it was good
UCL02a_377.882_5.1.wav_ASR	okay i'm okay
UCL02a_383.006_1.68.wav_ASR	so as little things as well you know
UCL02a_384.93_2.72.wav_ASR	some little things like that
UCL02a_388.125_1.06.wav_ASR	yeah about it
UCL02a_394.094_1.97.wav_ASR	that helped me on the actual day i happened to me yeah
UCL02a_397.44_1.06.wav_ASR	what happened to me
UCL02a_399.855_1.57.wav_ASR	well that was in the 80s
UCL02a_402.334_3.75.wav_ASR	so the it's the twenty year fifteen yeah
UCL02a_407.543_0.84.wav_ASR	twenty five years
UCL02a_408.4_1.08.wav_ASR	and he's making sense of it yeah
UCL02a_409.58_2.56.wav_ASR	so as awful four years ago
UCL02a_414.5_2.34.wav_ASR	yeah i suppose what i really remembered is stuff from me
UCL02a_416.862_0.77.wav_ASR	and he was in the evening
UCL02a_417.65_1.01.wav_ASR	and i got to work
UCL02a_419.58_2.06.wav_ASR	and as about nine thirty in the morning
UCL02a_422.308_1.74.wav_ASR	off the tube
UCL02a_424.068_1.71.wav_ASR	so then i'm gonna catch my bug
UCL02a_427.382_1.25.wav_ASR	and they got there into work
UCL02a_429.05_1.69.wav_ASR	and i remember it was really strange
UCL02a_432.378_3.07.wav_ASR	and i was gonna go into my computer
UCL02a_436.506_0.97.wav_ASR	and then suddenly
UCL02a_437.5_2.4.wav_ASR	he's just super motivated to work it on
UCL02a_440.439_4.99.wav_ASR	and i coulda used my computer
UCL02a_445.929_3.87.wav_ASR	what's my my code you know your right things
UCL02a_450.603_0.68.wav_ASR	what is she
UCL02a_451.3_1.04.wav_ASR	could you tell me what it is
UCL02a_452.404_0.36.wav_ASR	and so
UCL02a_454.288_1.27.wav_ASR	but i so much of my career
UCL02a_455.628_0.46.wav_ASR	and i says
UCL02a_456.246_7.3.wav_ASR	and henry i can't remember how to use my computer and things like that
UCL02a_464.158_1.26.wav_ASR	and then she suddenly noticed
UCL02a_465.465_2.41.wav_ASR	and she said to me that wasn't a bit strange to me as well
UCL02a_468.953_0.57.wav_ASR	that's the mother's voice
UCL02a_470.161_1.38.wav_ASR	okay okay
UCL02a_471.8_0.6.wav_ASR	when i thought
UCL02a_474.207_0.79.wav_ASR	it was fine for me
UCL02a_475.017_1.76.wav_ASR	and working around and things like that you know
UCL02a_476.8_2.11.wav_ASR	but still my brain is
UCL02a_480.117_4.99.wav_ASR	yeah i just couldn't remember what computer was and going downstairs like that at that time
UCL02a_485.795_3.66.wav_ASR	and suddenly some friends were talking to me
UCL02a_489.477_2.9.wav_ASR	and i couldn't what they were talking to me
UCL02a_494.892_2.06.wav_ASR	and then a friend of mine named she says
UCL02a_497.05_1.56.wav_ASR	oh yeah i'll get you sorted as well
UCL02a_499.0_1.51.wav_ASR	and she called nine one one
UCL02a_501.025_2.43.wav_ASR	yeah about nine o'clock in the morning
UCL02a_503.787_2.13.wav_ASR	we'll take you to the hospital firstnamea
UCL02a_507.338_1.89.wav_ASR	and i sat there for a couple of times as well
UCL02a_509.25_2.01.wav_ASR	and then they kicking for me for about nine
UCL02a_512.02_0.421.wav_ASR	and set down
UCL02a_512.456_1.29.wav_ASR	and one guy was talking to her
UCL02a_513.77_1.31.wav_ASR	and there's some other people in there
UCL02a_516.39_1.49.wav_ASR	and then you go was
UCL02a_517.899_1.26.wav_ASR	and then i couldn't speak to anyone
UCL02a_519.178_1.81.wav_ASR	we usetaobububububububububububububububububububububububububububububububububububulububulububulububulububulububulububulububulububulububulububulububulububulububulububulububulububulububulububulububulububulububulububulububulububulububulububulububulububulububulububulububulububulububulububulububulububulububulububulububulububulububulububulububulububulububulububulububulububulububulububulububulububulububulubub
UCL02a_522.583_7.091.wav_ASR	you know how they all sort of scan things to see like that and things to me
UCL02a_530.449_1.74.wav_ASR	and i couldn't speak to
UCL02a_533.17_0.79.wav_ASR	yeah i couldn't speak
UCL02a_534.844_2.64.wav_ASR	when people were talking to me i couldn't what they were talking to me
UCL02a_537.5_1.32.wav_ASR	okay one word yes
UCL02a_539.744_1.17.wav_ASR	and nothing was gone
UCL02a_542.169_5.25.wav_ASR	yeah i was here
UCL02a_547.468_1.91.wav_ASR	and then that doesn't about just ten eleven years ago
UCL02a_549.43_5.87.wav_ASR	so yeah at north north midland the first day as well
UCL02a_555.32_1.53.wav_ASR	and then i said after that was about it
UCL02a_557.638_2.43.wav_ASR	and then five six days
UCL02a_560.666_2.74.wav_ASR	and they moved me from there down here to u s l i
UCL02a_564.353_1.74.wav_ASR	what cost do you want me to say
UCL02a_568.078_5.12.wav_ASR	and and that was it
UCL02a_573.219_1.35.wav_ASR	oh yeah i mean you know
UCL02a_575.827_0.89.wav_ASR	and i remembered after that
UCL02a_576.741_1.01.wav_ASR	that's about five hours
UCL02a_577.773_1.11.wav_ASR	and as he's back
UCL02a_579.236_0.55.wav_ASR	and i'm getting up
UCL02a_579.81_3.71.wav_ASR	it was quite in the evening as in hospital
UCL02a_584.84_3.59.wav_ASR	and people would scan the doctors and try to write for me as well
UCL02a_588.451_4.45.wav_ASR	and it could be that could be my speaking was even worse than usual times as well
UCL02a_593.524_2.64.wav_ASR	and the next days while i just couldn't speak anyway
UCL02a_597.058_3.09.wav_ASR	and all the hospitals were there looking at me and other people up behind me
UCL02a_600.25_1.04.wav_ASR	and i couldn't
UCL02a_602.917_2.26.wav_ASR	and i i remember now
UCL02a_605.262_2.6.wav_ASR	the first day he even
UCL02a_608.048_0.74.wav_ASR	so that's what happened to me
UCL02a_608.959_0.82.wav_ASR	and it was too
UCL02a_609.799_0.88.wav_ASR	how i could speak to people
UCL02a_610.7_0.75.wav_ASR	oh people were looking at me
UCL02a_611.467_0.48.wav_ASR	and i looked
UCL02a_613.201_2.54.wav_ASR	when people talking to me
UCL02a_615.795_4.6.wav_ASR	and when they talked to me i couldn't speak to anything
UCL02a_620.505_0.55.wav_ASR	so well
UCL02a_621.961_1.52.wav_ASR	you know they're writing down
UCL02a_624.359_1.26.wav_ASR	the doctor said that that
UCL02a_625.666_1.39.wav_ASR	and i couldn't speak anything as well
UCL02a_628.52_4.16.wav_ASR	that's a worst of about you know about your three or four weeks
UCL02a_632.699_1.28.wav_ASR	and i remembered as well
UCL02a_634.0_2.21.wav_ASR	we'll we'll stay around at that that uhhuh
UCL02a_637.869_2.91.wav_ASR	and then after that as well as
UCL02a_640.8_0.48.wav_ASR	so yeah
UCL02a_641.3_2.15.wav_ASR	so mexico is ucl playing here
UCL02a_644.103_1.81.wav_ASR	and then this place is recording from him
UCL02a_646.0_0.38.wav_ASR	that's it
UCL02a_646.4_5.93.wav_ASR	the queen queen queen cinderella
UCL02a_652.975_4.0.wav_ASR	the new york new york yeah yeah
UCL02a_657.478_1.21.wav_ASR	that's about two weeks as well
UCL02a_659.32_1.48.wav_ASR	and they tested me up and down
UCL02a_661.705_2.51.wav_ASR	so that's i'm not even satisfied at this point
UCL02a_664.318_1.87.wav_ASR	so the first day that hit me on the first stroke yeah
UCL02a_675.556_1.58.wav_ASR	that's not getting any better yeah
UCL02a_677.863_3.8.wav_ASR	it's strange
UCL02a_681.681_3.38.wav_ASR	that was the next thing for me i was about two weeks after that happened
UCL02a_685.08_1.4.wav_ASR	so the first thing you do is you see
UCL02a_686.5_1.06.wav_ASR	and so he says
UCL02a_687.622_3.32.wav_ASR	and then two i could see the neurotissue
UCL02a_691.037_1.37.wav_ASR	how can i be the first one that is well
UCL02a_693.677_2.17.wav_ASR	and i remember there was the first one about two weeks
UCL02a_695.871_6.85.wav_ASR	and then some people were testing me up for like a fitness
UCL02a_704.304_2.18.wav_ASR	and some lady was a doctor
UCL02a_706.5_3.48.wav_ASR	as lots of tests me and things like that v d
UCL02a_712.938_1.25.wav_ASR	and she's excited me
UCL02a_714.208_1.77.wav_ASR	and you know these fountains are me
UCL02a_716.0_3.65.wav_ASR	and you know these cats
UCL02a_719.666_1.46.wav_ASR	so the dog and everything like that
UCL02a_721.149_1.73.wav_ASR	and what's this and so on me
UCL02a_723.85_4.47.wav_ASR	and sometimes i couldn't what she was talking about
UCL02a_728.336_1.86.wav_ASR	and he's said you'd like the food to think of things
UCL02a_730.212_3.77.wav_ASR	because as a dog you know scared things and everything like that
UCL02a_738.114_2.95.wav_ASR	but after that about two weeks a week
UCL02a_741.126_4.6.wav_ASR	and then that was called the stroke community people as well
UCL02a_747.398_2.78.wav_ASR	and the other thing was then group of people helping me up
UCL02a_750.539_5.96.wav_ASR	stroke community people helping me for writing some words to me
UCL02a_757.561_3.75.wav_ASR	help me some words in there
UCL02a_761.331_3.15.wav_ASR	like you know it's monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday saturday
UCL02a_764.5_1.42.wav_ASR	the first day i couldn't tell you
UCL02a_766.211_2.02.wav_ASR	and as a monday tuesday wednesday
UCL02a_768.626_0.55.wav_ASR	yeah i could remember
UCL02a_769.252_0.9.wav_ASR	that it monday too
UCL02a_770.176_1.63.wav_ASR	they could speak the word at me
UCL02a_772.961_6.7.wav_ASR	it's the first day second third fourth
UCL02a_779.679_0.83.wav_ASR	and then i couldn't
UCL02a_781.953_1.63.wav_ASR	and i still have problems with that now
UCL02a_783.712_1.47.wav_ASR	he hadta three four five six seven
UCL02a_785.2_1.08.wav_ASR	and the couple checked into the hotel
UCL02a_786.37_3.78.wav_ASR	but i almost forgot about me as though i couldn't speak up
UCL02a_790.171_3.41.wav_ASR	you know what days are
UCL02a_793.6_0.79.wav_ASR	what am i
UCL02a_795.524_1.21.wav_ASR	where you are my going
UCL02a_796.901_1.38.wav_ASR	how i could write what's all again
UCL02a_799.104_2.08.wav_ASR	that was difficult for me as you know you know
UCL02a_801.24_3.72.wav_ASR	there was some people i spoke with for about
UCL02a_806.4_3.15.wav_ASR	as about six months she was there
UCL02a_810.46_2.21.wav_ASR	every week for me some lady was talking to me
UCL02a_812.693_6.05.wav_ASR	and you know reaching some words and helping out that that
UCL02a_818.791_1.44.wav_ASR	so i asked that about two weeks
UCL02a_821.718_4.68.wav_ASR	and then after that as soon she said
UCL02a_826.419_1.74.wav_ASR	so three weeks in at that
UCL02a_828.767_2.69.wav_ASR	three weeks or nine weeks yeah
UCL02a_832.093_7.38.wav_ASR	and then after my month and then with you at the y s conference
UCL02a_840.063_1.49.wav_ASR	that was the first test as well
UCL02a_841.662_2.74.wav_ASR	that was that
UCL02a_845.928_4.83.wav_ASR	you know if me you know with a stroke like i work around
UCL02a_850.827_3.82.wav_ASR	and then those are a big problem for me as you know and things like that
UCL02a_854.716_0.61.wav_ASR	and i was okay
UCL02a_856.337_3.78.wav_ASR	you know by the bus in the tube and things like that
UCL02a_860.14_0.69.wav_ASR	that's fun to see
UCL02a_861.098_3.8.wav_ASR	you come back by the time by myself
UCL02a_865.175_1.64.wav_ASR	and not being able to help people was well
UCL02a_867.837_2.54.wav_ASR	that's a bit weird for me
UCL02a_870.4_4.58.wav_ASR	and i think i was trying to understand other people that would aphasia like me
UCL02a_875.2_1.96.wav_ASR	if you're by yourself a pirate
UCL02a_877.224_0.68.wav_ASR	and you can have coffee
UCL02a_878.342_1.19.wav_ASR	and he coulda helped
UCL02a_881.28_2.41.wav_ASR	can't be watered for me sometimes
UCL02a_883.763_1.66.wav_ASR	so i'm not much better now
UCL02a_885.443_1.45.wav_ASR	but you can be able you know
UCL02a_887.833_4.93.wav_ASR	but i'm talking about now to other people you know
UCL02a_893.03_5.1.wav_ASR	but i suppose after that is better for me now
UCL02a_898.696_6.84.wav_ASR	but yeah i mean physically you woke up
UCL02a_905.56_0.96.wav_ASR	and then find me
UCL02a_907.365_2.52.wav_ASR	but it just you know is my brain thing as well
UCL02a_909.992_0.51.wav_ASR	so we are here
UCL02a_911.188_1.79.wav_ASR	so i make sense yeah yeah
UCL02a_940.576_0.67.wav_ASR	see you won't see it
UCL02a_941.493_0.61.wav_ASR	just say anything
UCL02a_942.392_1.14.wav_ASR	how to say it so yeah yeah
UCL02a_948.585_0.9.wav_ASR	what was the little kid
UCL02a_955.002_2.69.wav_ASR	what is the kid or or what is kid he says
UCL02a_966.107_3.03.wav_ASR	and then what do you do what already happened to me yeah
UCL02a_971.144_7.25.wav_ASR	so if you sit me straight with what what was happening to me as a kid yeah
UCL02a_978.444_0.75.wav_ASR	oh sorry yeah
UCL02a_979.633_2.56.wav_ASR	don't you want me to speak the language things like that or not
UCL02a_986.138_3.38.wav_ASR	yeah and what's the strange of today is quite strange as well
UCL02a_989.538_1.6.wav_ASR	what is nine fifty eight
UCL02a_992.535_2.48.wav_ASR	but i remember when i was lucky when i was kicked
UCL02a_995.033_0.71.wav_ASR	they're strange as well
UCL02a_995.761_5.8.wav_ASR	and i mean i was about ten ten to thirty years as a kid
UCL02a_1002.376_7.93.wav_ASR	and i was living in naples eaties eaties

UCL02a_1055.824_2.03.wav_ASR	vl vl sl
UCL02a_1058.851_0.67.wav_ASR	you know all things
UCL02a_1060.129_0.32.wav_ASR	and i said
UCL02a_1061.36_1.67.wav_ASR	venice venice
UCL02a_1063.289_0.95.wav_ASR	that could be the word as well as

UCL02a_1102.743_1.24.wav_ASR	that was wonderful for me
UCL02a_1104.0_0.87.wav_ASR	oh i was lucky
UCL02a_1105.801_5.43.wav_ASR	and many times as well i remember as amazing
UCL02a_1111.66_5.83.wav_ASR	because i remember where near napes where we lived in the other part was no there of
UCL02a_1119.401_0.9.wav_ASR	look at what was going on
UCL02a_1122.722_0.47.wav_ASR	so i said
UCL02a_1123.837_4.04.wav_ASR	that little place where the the rooms the rooms there

UCL02a_1140.562_0.67.wav_ASR	and word is still
UCL02a_1141.249_0.33.wav_ASR	that was terrible
UCL02a_1141.6_0.78.wav_ASR	let's see how long you can drive now
UCL02a_1142.4_2.07.wav_ASR	so that's beautiful as well i'm going up there
UCL02a_1146.5_0.73.wav_ASR	it was beautiful
UCL02a_1147.45_3.91.wav_ASR	so i don't if something was really good to me it was a good nice feeling
UCL02a_1151.961_1.02.wav_ASR	and i'm really feeling yeah
UCL02a_1153.0_1.95.wav_ASR	and that that was boily in the cage
UCL02a_1155.978_1.45.wav_ASR	so i didn't have any sense as well because it was time
UCL02a_1157.451_2.07.wav_ASR	and i mean it was usually a wonderful day as well
UCL02a_1159.847_0.73.wav_ASR	hey strange as well
UCL02a_1160.596_0.44.wav_ASR	so i'm like
UCL02a_1161.374_2.5.wav_ASR	yeah ten to about thirty years as well
UCL02a_1164.139_2.9.wav_ASR	then my parents thought to go back to england
UCL02a_1168.309_0.98.wav_ASR	how to school
UCL02a_1169.391_6.21.wav_ASR	and then when i finish you know to university at kings he after that
UCL02a_1179.707_0.74.wav_ASR	so as nice
UCL02a_1180.518_1.69.wav_ASR	ten years is about ten weeks
UCL02a_1183.37_5.06.wav_ASR	teen is about ten years again just after that
UCL02a_1188.696_3.17.wav_ASR	so at nineteen eighteen
UCL02a_1192.48_1.17.wav_ASR	and i found
UCL02a_1194.89_3.13.wav_ASR	so about fifteen years as well
UCL02a_1198.222_5.16.wav_ASR	where i found out where the old house was staying neighbor in the neighborhood
UCL02a_1203.403_7.26.wav_ASR	that was called the lucifer out of naphrax which is a very toxic part of the medication
UCL02a_1210.851_1.2.wav_ASR	and i found where it was

UCL02a_1216.514_5.05.wav_ASR	that's a couple of times as well as whole day looking around where it is and find
UCL02a_1221.964_0.68.wav_ASR	we need something
UCL02a_1223.734_3.25.wav_ASR	and he was like
UCL02a_1227.0_0.98.wav_ASR	it's quite strange because i was
UCL02a_1228.41_4.07.wav_ASR	so little thing be rented as well with hot holes and things like that
UCL02a_1232.5_1.32.wav_ASR	that's terrible what happened up there
UCL02a_1234.704_0.61.wav_ASR	it was lucky
UCL02a_1235.413_0.57.wav_ASR	what's she doing
UCL02a_1236.0_0.63.wav_ASR	he was like yeah
UCL02a_1236.684_1.21.wav_ASR	that's why i always use as well
UCL02a_1286.807_7.87.wav_ASR	and i just wanted to a working a right or something like that yeah
UCL02a_1294.873_1.09.wav_ASR	don't want to speak to me now
UCL02a_1305.334_0.85.wav_ASR	okay alright
UCL02a_1306.2_3.5.wav_ASR	as a kid a little young kid
UCL02a_1309.751_1.54.wav_ASR	and he's they play with his foot over
UCL02a_1311.308_7.67.wav_ASR	he was out in the garden oh my god
UCL02a_1319.06_0.68.wav_ASR	good me too
UCL02a_1320.557_1.02.wav_ASR	he stayed with his foot all the way over there
UCL02a_1321.818_1.27.wav_ASR	and he's helped football
UCL02a_1323.141_11.15.wav_ASR	but when he's scuring out his foot he smashes into a a glass a window or maybe the neighbor or whatever have you
UCL02a_1335.475_4.96.wav_ASR	and he's hit his head in his window
UCL02a_1340.882_4.03.wav_ASR	so when the glass is bad inside his his foot broke
UCL02a_1346.475_4.81.wav_ASR	but his neighbor is then was actually the same in his house
UCL02a_1352.128_1.17.wav_ASR	his neighbor was set downstairs
UCL02a_1353.343_7.07.wav_ASR	and then suddenly he could see that his foot was smashed into his glove
UCL02a_1361.897_3.71.wav_ASR	so his neighbor
UCL02a_1368.491_8.22.wav_ASR	and the guy he's just seen that someone has smashed into his window
UCL02a_1377.61_2.64.wav_ASR	and he come on with little kids and other kids
UCL02a_1380.38_4.5.wav_ASR	but the guy can see the football is is missing
UCL02a_1385.553_1.45.wav_ASR	and he can see where it is
UCL02a_1388.186_6.55.wav_ASR	but he could also see his big hole as well in his window in his glass yeah
UCL02a_1396.458_0.67.wav_ASR	that's about it you know
UCL02a_1438.78_0.39.wav_ASR	okay
UCL02a_1439.388_5.81.wav_ASR	the lady is got her little kid

UCL02a_1454.398_0.82.wav_ASR	that trail was right
UCL02a_1456.209_0.53.wav_ASR	don't want right
UCL02a_1461.232_1.39.wav_ASR	can't speak a new word
UCL02a_1463.637_1.54.wav_ASR	and i just think the sandwich was forever you know

UCL02a_1506.216_1.49.wav_ASR	you can't say english word for now
UCL02a_1514.282_1.22.wav_ASR	so i thought to myself
UCL02a_1516.067_1.7.wav_ASR	and anything the substance of this is
UCL02a_1522.5_2.45.wav_ASR	and anyway this woman little baby kid

UCL02a_1542.572_2.39.wav_ASR	and i don't think the sprouts now is this little thing anymore
UCL02a_1545.564_0.49.wav_ASR	oh my gosh
UCL02a_1547.152_1.87.wav_ASR	count what the issue is is not any
UCL02a_1550.339_1.76.wav_ASR	oh well little kid she wants to go out
UCL02a_1552.835_1.13.wav_ASR	they'll kid one to walk
UCL02a_1554.256_5.88.wav_ASR	and she's going off with her little buckshot and the little baby kid
UCL02a_1560.158_1.51.wav_ASR	and she she's going out walking around
UCL02a_1561.686_2.4.wav_ASR	and then suddenly realized it started to get wet
UCL02a_1564.243_0.59.wav_ASR	it's rainy
UCL02a_1566.525_4.96.wav_ASR	little baby kicks back to school because he's pouring down his rain as well
UCL02a_1573.344_1.59.wav_ASR	and she hasta go back again
UCL02a_1575.035_1.04.wav_ASR	and she's speaking to her mom
UCL02a_1576.189_5.16.wav_ASR	and then she could the little baby dolls she's really wet and poor with rain
UCL02a_1581.364_2.38.wav_ASR	and she's back there as well which has been very very cold
UCL02a_1585.185_1.78.wav_ASR	and now she can't remember what her
UCL02a_1587.492_1.17.wav_ASR	oh yeah almost a word as well
UCL02a_1591.198_3.82.wav_ASR	it's right right after umbrella

williamson14b_910.888_10.49.wav_ASR	and the glass for screw it back
williamson14b_921.962_6.41.wav_ASR	and and the peanut was there
williamson14b_930.798_2.17.wav_ASR	and and a knife
williamson14b_934.477_2.21.wav_ASR	and he spread it around
williamson14b_938.003_3.4.wav_ASR	and make some peanut butter
williamson14b_943.261_0.32.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_21.326_0.39.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_33.919_2.51.wav_ASR	oh it it comes and goes
wright204a_36.502_8.6.wav_ASR	but that i mean normally i can get things but then there are times when i can't get the words out
wright204a_46.058_5.75.wav_ASR	so then i hafta either try and write or see stuff
wright204a_52.361_3.35.wav_ASR	and after the time i i get it and sometimes i do
wright204a_70.687_0.41.wav_ASR	yes
wright204a_72.596_8.66.wav_ASR	it was november the fifteenth eighth
wright204a_83.112_2.56.wav_ASR	it was right after obituration a law as well
wright204a_87.358_3.86.wav_ASR	and i actually diagnosed
wright204a_91.931_2.52.wav_ASR	he decided that it was something was wrong with me
wright204a_94.5_1.48.wav_ASR	it was about five o'clock
wright204a_96.693_17.35.wav_ASR	and i actually before i had anything to my wife i went to comateo to downwind me
wright204a_116.296_6.93.wav_ASR	it was a wasububububububububu
wright204a_125.236_1.64.wav_ASR	the doctors think you know
wright204a_127.587_1.32.wav_ASR	and i got stuck
wright204a_129.639_0.521.wav_ASR	and i forgot about it
wright204a_131.354_1.07.wav_ASR	they think i have a stroke
wright204a_132.539_1.42.wav_ASR	and then i went in and told my wife
wright204a_135.675_8.74.wav_ASR	and she was amazingly because my mother had one noticed that i had a little bit of sweat in there
wright204a_144.878_3.05.wav_ASR	so she immediately called the paramedics
wright204a_148.982_0.93.wav_ASR	and i says
wright204a_150.235_2.4.wav_ASR	well they're doing that i got to get dressed for the ball
wright204a_153.306_1.62.wav_ASR	and i had my shorts on
wright204a_154.992_4.06.wav_ASR	and i hadta put a pair of hands on to go to the doctor right
wright204a_161.391_1.24.wav_ASR	and so i did
wright204a_163.103_1.76.wav_ASR	the vermont came up
wright204a_165.426_1.7.wav_ASR	and i says
wright204a_168.011_1.22.wav_ASR	thank you i'm having a stroke
wright204a_169.941_1.47.wav_ASR	and they looked at me
wright204a_171.523_2.04.wav_ASR	and then they looked at me again
wright204a_173.581_0.4.wav_ASR	and they says
wright204a_174.146_0.86.wav_ASR	what you're right
wright204a_176.302_1.03.wav_ASR	so we met
wright204a_177.886_0.79.wav_ASR	everything was fine
wright204a_178.771_1.52.wav_ASR	and i was still awake
wright204a_180.306_1.01.wav_ASR	everything was great
wright204a_182.077_6.1.wav_ASR	and that's after going on the ambulance i sort of don't remember
wright204a_193.108_0.34.wav_ASR	well
wright204a_196.357_2.49.wav_ASR	well this is a stroke that's a bleeding stroke
wright204a_200.509_1.51.wav_ASR	so that was the kind of headache
wright204a_202.822_0.7.wav_ASR	yeah right
wright204a_204.132_3.8.wav_ASR	which i understand is little bit less than half survive
wright204a_208.966_0.67.wav_ASR	and that was me
wright204a_210.501_0.9.wav_ASR	that was one of the luckiest
wright204a_212.664_5.3.wav_ASR	and i i was in three different hospitals
wright204a_218.922_5.15.wav_ASR	and really didn't come out of anything until about
wright204a_225.73_0.45.wav_ASR	let's see
wright204a_227.123_9.64.wav_ASR	we would say the middle of december just before christmas o'clock there's when i remember really for the first time
wright204a_238.834_1.62.wav_ASR	and i was out for a long time
wright204a_240.614_4.38.wav_ASR	and all kinds of tests and
wright204a_247.286_2.71.wav_ASR	so two three and a might
wright204a_250.143_1.63.wav_ASR	and so
wright204a_252.388_1.03.wav_ASR	that's what they're called
wright204a_255.308_1.49.wav_ASR	shean the put it in
wright204a_258.047_5.38.wav_ASR	and from then on then i was at burros
wright204a_263.563_11.04.wav_ASR	and i remember all the berries where i had all three of things for speech therapy
wright204a_285.874_1.82.wav_ASR	well i'm all alone in too
wright204a_288.289_6.62.wav_ASR	my i hadta learn to use more of my left than i wanted to
wright204a_295.072_5.09.wav_ASR	but i was paralyzed on the whole right side
wright204a_301.173_1.18.wav_ASR	for quite a long time
wright204a_303.069_4.89.wav_ASR	when i get out of the hospital for the three times i was in a wheelchair
wright204a_315.318_2.19.wav_ASR	you know they were all all for one to the other
wright204a_318.564_0.31.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_319.489_15.42.wav_ASR	so really from the development of oreguth through about the end of september october december i was in the hospital
wright204a_337.032_3.05.wav_ASR	because we had different problems
wright204a_340.132_1.81.wav_ASR	and i had seizure
wright204a_343.379_4.39.wav_ASR	and i had some kind of thing that i don't even remember
wright204a_348.779_3.78.wav_ASR	and so it took a long time just to get out of the hospital
wright204a_353.142_6.05.wav_ASR	but i was home in december to just celebrate january
wright204a_360.553_13.81.wav_ASR	and firstnameiv in february four so short i started up therapy at johnny charlie research hospital over in chico
wright204a_375.474_6.3.wav_ASR	and i've been there through the end of two years
wright204a_391.134_0.65.wav_ASR	that's correct
wright204a_400.899_0.38.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_423.934_1.43.wav_ASR	and she says
wright204a_426.385_3.17.wav_ASR	hey i had a very good life
wright204a_430.939_2.71.wav_ASR	oh i don't know
wright204a_434.419_0.39.wav_ASR	maybe
wright204a_435.869_1.32.wav_ASR	and it was fifty cents
wright204a_437.931_2.89.wav_ASR	my first child was a big event
wright204a_441.696_4.35.wav_ASR	my second third child was you know
wright204a_448.445_4.81.wav_ASR	we just had her fifteen seventeen this last
wright204a_454.55_4.98.wav_ASR	well it'll be a year in march april fifteenth
wright204a_460.255_1.8.wav_ASR	we were our fifty feet first here
wright204a_462.698_3.202.wav_ASR	so there's lots of things you know
wright204a_466.905_2.09.wav_ASR	and i had a good life as a child
wright204a_469.055_1.22.wav_ASR	but it was an only child
wright204a_471.226_6.03.wav_ASR	oh i don't really know what to say
wright204a_488.482_2.61.wav_ASR	so i didn't really cry or anything
wright204a_551.677_4.2.wav_ASR	the little boy is playing with a soccer ball i guess
wright204a_556.512_3.27.wav_ASR	and he happens to hit the window
wright204a_562.435_1.63.wav_ASR	and he goes in
wright204a_564.087_8.98.wav_ASR	and he hit the guy inside as is in the picture is sitting down
wright204a_573.142_3.66.wav_ASR	and it hits my chest or at least it comes in the window
wright204a_577.402_1.19.wav_ASR	so we's got glass
wright204a_579.694_1.82.wav_ASR	and he goes
wright204a_581.882_2.06.wav_ASR	and he looks at the window
wright204a_583.994_0.79.wav_ASR	and he has to walk
wright204a_584.804_8.2.wav_ASR	and apparently he's going out to see what happened and maybe let the ball go back to the middle child
wright204a_611.342_0.53.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_612.361_1.49.wav_ASR	looks like it's ready for school
wright204a_614.634_3.67.wav_ASR	and she says looks like he might wanna take the umbrella
wright204a_619.559_2.09.wav_ASR	and she said okay
wright204a_623.716_0.88.wav_ASR	and she say
wright204a_625.692_0.59.wav_ASR	maybe not
wright204a_626.402_0.35.wav_ASR	don't know
wright204a_626.8_2.35.wav_ASR	because now he's going to school
wright204a_629.803_0.94.wav_ASR	oh it isn't
wright204a_630.763_0.47.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_633.482_1.14.wav_ASR	and she says
wright204a_634.899_1.17.wav_ASR	oh i don't think i need it
wright204a_637.004_1.53.wav_ASR	he goes
wright204a_639.482_1.63.wav_ASR	and he must be waiting for the bus
wright204a_641.129_1.2.wav_ASR	and it's calming the rain
wright204a_642.924_2.12.wav_ASR	so now it's coming down pretty good
wright204a_645.498_1.72.wav_ASR	so he goes back to the house
wright204a_647.796_0.36.wav_ASR	and he says
wright204a_648.654_0.66.wav_ASR	and all wet
wright204a_650.019_0.33.wav_ASR	and he says
wright204a_651.289_1.3.wav_ASR	we'd better go take the umbrella
wright204a_672.485_0.54.wav_ASR	let's see
wright204a_677.959_4.91.wav_ASR	looks like the problem is the cat is stuck up in a tree
wright204a_683.65_0.4.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_685.27_2.21.wav_ASR	mother is out on the tree
wright204a_687.552_3.18.wav_ASR	oh and he's kinda stuck himself i think
wright204a_691.424_2.46.wav_ASR	the little girl is crying for the cat
wright204a_694.509_1.57.wav_ASR	oh she got an umbrella
wright204a_696.668_4.34.wav_ASR	there's a guy barking up the tree
wright204a_701.845_1.46.wav_ASR	the fire department is coming
wright204a_703.403_5.75.wav_ASR	the little girl was trying to reach my i guess
wright204a_709.619_2.69.wav_ASR	don't know she was trying to get this ladder or not
wright204a_712.623_1.35.wav_ASR	and no idea about that
wright204a_715.021_2.4.wav_ASR	but anyway the firemen are coming
wright204a_717.541_1.03.wav_ASR	you're truck is there
wright204a_718.865_6.08.wav_ASR	and they're coming out with the ladder carefully to help get the cat and father out of there
wright204a_729.715_0.44.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_730.298_1.47.wav_ASR	so that's that's a real picture
wright204a_733.872_5.81.wav_ASR	but this is a a probably a flat stroke
wright204a_740.511_1.38.wav_ASR	probably right here in arizona
wright204a_744.599_3.77.wav_ASR	but the girl was patiently watched down the river
wright204a_749.301_2.17.wav_ASR	and this is her rescue
wright204a_752.238_8.31.wav_ASR	and she is handing onto a branch that they're trying to get her to save
wright204a_764.718_0.38.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_772.353_0.32.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_776.476_0.63.wav_ASR	yes i do
wright204a_903.564_5.15.wav_ASR	oh she was
wright204a_911.851_7.38.wav_ASR	the the story involving the two daughters and the what i called the the cruel
wright204a_920.645_13.21.wav_ASR	and she i i couldn't remember even from looking at that what the relative ship was to the the good cinderella
wright204a_935.994_4.63.wav_ASR	yeah i know that she was like a servant
wright204a_941.361_9.2.wav_ASR	and they were really putting her down
wright204a_950.842_7.62.wav_ASR	so she was always doing stuff where the other two girls were you know very nice
wright204a_958.521_3.91.wav_ASR	and was all nice and stuff for them
wright204a_962.813_18.18.wav_ASR	when they went to the the ball it turned out that the cinderella was the one who they put the shoe on
wright204a_982.77_14.44.wav_ASR	when they got away because it was a a pumpkin that was gonna turn into a pumpkin she hadta get back
wright204a_997.767_7.21.wav_ASR	and she she lost shoe
wright204a_1006.404_0.31.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_1007.312_9.14.wav_ASR	and so then when the the people i guess one of the people for the
wright204a_1018.414_1.11.wav_ASR	what would a doctor say
wright204a_1019.765_5.209.wav_ASR	so he the this it's the
wright204a_1026.704_2.301.wav_ASR	see this is my trouble with this story
wright204a_1029.076_5.01.wav_ASR	we were trying to get the
wright204a_1037.097_1.48.wav_ASR	it's the prince is prince
wright204a_1039.786_3.76.wav_ASR	and he he he was trying to find her
wright204a_1044.411_1.69.wav_ASR	and he was out looking
wright204a_1047.777_0.92.wav_ASR	he had a shoe
wright204a_1049.77_4.47.wav_ASR	and the shoe the only fit was cinderella
wright204a_1055.312_1.88.wav_ASR	and so he says
wright204a_1057.679_2.63.wav_ASR	and they'll be it will be man and wife
wright204a_1060.912_1.76.wav_ASR	you know everything will be fine forever
wright204a_1067.508_0.34.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_1076.539_0.49.wav_ASR	oh yeah
wright204a_1077.591_1.12.wav_ASR	what is my favorite song
wright204a_1081.112_3.04.wav_ASR	so you need two pieces of bread
wright204a_1084.91_1.51.wav_ASR	and we needed peanut butter
wright204a_1086.66_0.79.wav_ASR	what do you call it
wright204a_1087.972_1.83.wav_ASR	and i i don't put butter on it
wright204a_1089.96_0.57.wav_ASR	and i just forgot
wright204a_1091.312_1.41.wav_ASR	hey i used to
wright204a_1092.847_1.09.wav_ASR	we don't do that anymore
wright204a_1093.952_6.07.wav_ASR	actually my wife does it now until i can get this hand stroke going because it's kind of weak
wright204a_1100.249_6.65.wav_ASR	but anyway you put bread on one
wright204a_1107.215_1.62.wav_ASR	and you put jelly on the other side
wright204a_1109.293_0.88.wav_ASR	and put them together
wright204a_1110.995_0.48.wav_ASR	and i says
wright204a_1116.724_6.94.wav_ASR	oh i've had peanut butter and jelly as as a child all the way until now
wright204a_1125.475_2.17.wav_ASR	so it's kind of what my favorite
wright207a_23.754_0.32.wav_ASR	okay
