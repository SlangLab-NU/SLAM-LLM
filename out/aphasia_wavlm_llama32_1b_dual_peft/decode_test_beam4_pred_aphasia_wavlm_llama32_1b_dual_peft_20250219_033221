fridriksson07a_932.955_6.92.wav_ASR	and i couldn't understand what the ladder is for but i guess the guy climbed up the ladder and then the ladder fell
fridriksson07a_954.76_0.34.wav_ASR	yes
fridriksson07a_958.107_4.76.wav_ASR	oh i think the last time i read it was years ago
fridriksson07a_975.646_0.54.wav_ASR	oh okay
fridriksson07a_1095.08_12.54.wav_ASR	well the the thing of it is that cinderella was she was under the control of her stepmother and two stepsisters
fridriksson07a_1108.411_2.15.wav_ASR	and they treated her like a maid
fridriksson07a_1111.509_4.88.wav_ASR	and then they were having a ball at the
fridriksson07a_1117.065_3.86.wav_ASR	that's what she was looking out the window at the castle and everything
fridriksson07a_1121.443_6.61.wav_ASR	and then when they decided they wouldn't let her go because she would be in combat with the two sisters
fridriksson07a_1129.018_3.57.wav_ASR	and then a fire fire department came
fridriksson07a_1133.326_5.58.wav_ASR	and got her all dressed up and ready to go to the ball
fridriksson07a_1139.72_2.4.wav_ASR	you give her a pair of slippers
fridriksson07a_1143.746_8.07.wav_ASR	and she went to the ball but she hadta be back by twelve o'clock
fridriksson07a_1153.31_1.67.wav_ASR	and so she was dancing
fridriksson07a_1155.0_4.63.wav_ASR	and the prince chose her to dance with
fridriksson07a_1159.677_2.02.wav_ASR	and i guess he fell in love right away
fridriksson07a_1162.249_4.76.wav_ASR	and then the clock struck twelve
fridriksson07a_1167.86_3.01.wav_ASR	and she ran out but she lost the slipper
fridriksson07a_1172.448_1.9.wav_ASR	and then they found the slipper
fridriksson07a_1174.419_9.12.wav_ASR	and then by the time she got back her her carriage had turned to a pumpkin
fridriksson07a_1184.579_1.19.wav_ASR	you know what i'm saying
fridriksson07a_1185.919_1.97.wav_ASR	okay now let me think a minute
fridriksson07a_1188.29_6.09.wav_ASR	and so they were going all over looking for the person that lost the slipper
fridriksson07a_1194.4_3.25.wav_ASR	and they came back to cinderella's house
fridriksson07a_1198.045_4.27.wav_ASR	so they tried it with the two stepsisters and it didn't fit
fridriksson07a_1203.12_4.56.wav_ASR	so then they asked cinderella to try it
fridriksson07a_1207.7_1.21.wav_ASR	and and they were just
fridriksson07a_1209.733_1.54.wav_ASR	oh no no she wasn't even there
fridriksson07a_1211.295_5.34.wav_ASR	but when they turned it on then fit
fridriksson07a_1217.703_5.54.wav_ASR	so they took her back to the palace palace
fridriksson07a_1224.46_4.25.wav_ASR	and the she married the prince
fridriksson07a_1231.895_1.51.wav_ASR	you know

kansas04a_54.764_1.58.wav_ASR	well sorry no i'm sorry
kansas04a_56.809_9.79.wav_ASR	and then i went out with my friends and they were concerned because i was driving accidentally
kansas04a_68.079_9.21.wav_ASR	oh she said that i drove to cars and i had difficulty with my speech
kansas04a_77.957_5.16.wav_ASR	and i met home and i met my husband at the local warren hospital

kansas04a_95.153_1.87.wav_ASR	don't talking to anybody or anything
kansas04a_97.072_3.29.wav_ASR	and so i went home and i went to bed that night

kansas04a_144.096_13.82.wav_ASR	and at that point i was concerned enough that i was thinking about the strength at home and not one across the street from my office
kansas04a_158.827_1.8.wav_ASR	so i think i drove myself
kansas04a_161.92_1.11.wav_ASR	so i drove myself
kansas04a_163.284_3.31.wav_ASR	well i got out there part in the program please

kansas04a_170.986_6.08.wav_ASR	and i told him to tell them what what i thought
kansas04a_177.562_3.58.wav_ASR	because i could not communicate at that point
kansas04a_182.356_4.06.wav_ASR	and i was there for over night and they sent me home
kansas04a_187.406_9.41.wav_ASR	and then i did not feel well the next morning so i had him take me back to the hospital and i stayed for couple weeks
kansas04a_207.011_5.1.wav_ASR	well i had therapy and on my speech and writing
kansas04a_213.604_6.17.wav_ASR	but they didn't give it to me for very long
kansas04a_220.931_5.04.wav_ASR	and you know i was in the hospital i had my speech and writing therapy
kansas04a_226.382_3.15.wav_ASR	and then i got home and had some physical therapy
kansas04a_259.052_0.729.wav_ASR	you know
kansas04a_263.423_8.6.wav_ASR	well when i got married the first time i was much older
kansas04a_273.102_2.34.wav_ASR	and she left it up to me
kansas04a_276.529_5.33.wav_ASR	and i went home and then went back to lawrence
kansas04a_281.881_3.75.wav_ASR	well i got married and firstnamel firstnamej
kansas04a_294.955_9.48.wav_ASR	and we had dinner and then we went to back to the hotel
kansas04a_304.94_3.42.wav_ASR	and my uncle married me
kansas04a_309.335_2.86.wav_ASR	and he's a medical student firstnamem
kansas04a_313.018_7.98.wav_ASR	and his wife took over the bathroom sink in there
kansas04a_322.108_15.2.wav_ASR	and so then we went to the chapel and on the way my brother and all of them were driving and he almost wrecked
kansas04a_342.23_1.91.wav_ASR	well i think that will be enough at that story
kansas04a_369.621_4.36.wav_ASR	well this little boy is practicing his soccer ball
kansas04a_376.048_2.66.wav_ASR	and then he kicks it through the window
kansas04a_379.812_1.49.wav_ASR	and it breaks the window
kansas04a_382.375_3.03.wav_ASR	and it goes into this man's house
kansas04a_386.256_1.9.wav_ASR	and he's very startled
kansas04a_389.349_6.47.wav_ASR	and he gets up and looks out the window to see where it came from
kansas04a_396.096_10.7.wav_ASR	now it doesn't tell you whether the boy ran away or if he kicked the soccer ball
kansas04a_435.24_4.79.wav_ASR	mother wants the little boy to take the umbrella
kansas04a_443.068_1.73.wav_ASR	doesn't want to take the umbrella
kansas04a_446.585_4.68.wav_ASR	so it goes out and it starts to rain of course as his mother told him it would
kansas04a_452.243_1.56.wav_ASR	so he goes back
kansas04a_454.24_0.91.wav_ASR	and she tells it
kansas04a_455.171_1.15.wav_ASR	and he's very wet
kansas04a_457.426_5.56.wav_ASR	so we go back in the house and she's very angry with him because he hasn't taken the umbrella
kansas04a_463.777_7.44.wav_ASR	so in the last picture he has the umbrella and it's up and he's walking very happily
kansas04a_506.81_1.84.wav_ASR	well the cat is in the tree
kansas04a_510.155_1.81.wav_ASR	dog is barking at the cat

kansas04a_527.276_4.41.wav_ASR	and the father is still in the tree and he's looking very gloomy
kansas04a_532.649_2.56.wav_ASR	and the birds are singing
kansas04a_537.485_4.46.wav_ASR	that's really queer as everything else is going on

kansas04a_782.592_7.02.wav_ASR	so they got a letter invited the household to the ball
kansas04a_791.424_5.37.wav_ASR	the mother said that cinderella could not go
kansas04a_798.1_1.62.wav_ASR	and she was very upset
kansas04a_800.608_12.89.wav_ASR	and so she tried to get her dress together and the two stepsisters tore it apart
kansas04a_815.132_22.74.wav_ASR	and so she went out and told her fairy godmother that they hadn't gotten to get to go
kansas04a_837.925_6.54.wav_ASR	and and she was crying and and the fairy godmother said
kansas04a_845.377_4.79.wav_ASR	down her dress and in with her wand of course

kansas05a_554.453_7.16.wav_ASR	there's a friend eating working with that person this one
kansas05a_563.678_3.27.wav_ASR	because these people are making a problem
kansas05a_580.09_0.63.wav_ASR	what is that
kansas05a_589.826_1.82.wav_ASR	oh well that's kind of dumb stuff
kansas05a_593.266_2.41.wav_ASR	and think that takes a little work to make that look right
kansas05a_596.395_2.36.wav_ASR	oh okay i'm supposed to
kansas05a_600.809_1.48.wav_ASR	well what do i suppose to do with this one
kansas05a_603.491_0.94.wav_ASR	what's it afraid of
kansas05a_605.0_1.13.wav_ASR	did the window break
kansas05a_608.523_1.45.wav_ASR	okay well that's it then
kansas05a_643.723_19.47.wav_ASR	so the first person is no less a problem there
kansas05a_666.113_5.28.wav_ASR	the next time i thought
kansas05a_674.141_4.53.wav_ASR	looking at the tree tins and again
kansas05a_681.195_14.69.wav_ASR	and believing that the second people should
kansas05a_702.031_0.71.wav_ASR	think so
kansas05a_703.736_3.14.wav_ASR	he's not sposta do that for him
kansas05a_708.008_3.8.wav_ASR	well this one guy wants to come down
kansas05a_712.325_1.15.wav_ASR	four years ago
kansas05a_715.293_1.03.wav_ASR	well that's not quite right but
kansas05a_718.205_0.34.wav_ASR	what
kansas05a_719.0_0.38.wav_ASR	which one
kansas05a_721.863_10.62.wav_ASR	there's looking out a far on the the trees and how to deal with those things
kansas05a_732.528_5.87.wav_ASR	and the old stuff that's been afraid there
kansas05a_740.616_16.13.wav_ASR	there the mother is not happy with her person of what went all the little problems that they look at together
kansas05a_759.633_4.72.wav_ASR	well then he was back there again
kansas05a_764.921_0.88.wav_ASR	oh oh i see
kansas05a_766.03_12.56.wav_ASR	his mother wanted him to go back to the good stuff again so that he could go back and make them look better
kansas05a_779.24_4.95.wav_ASR	and he goes back and the ideas that he's got them go back and look look better
kansas05a_812.463_2.81.wav_ASR	well i guess she started with that
kansas05a_819.976_6.9.wav_ASR	people sitting with them they're messes or stuff around
kansas05a_827.928_1.1.wav_ASR	one two his
kansas05a_831.043_4.35.wav_ASR	guess the the kind of buster most people there
kansas05a_837.143_11.29.wav_ASR	well let's see there's the the man who's trying to talk with him about that back over to that kind of stuff
kansas05a_848.486_4.42.wav_ASR	it was going to be over fairly care by this younger stuff
kansas05a_854.133_3.71.wav_ASR	just can't make it is big enough to make that kind of stuff
kansas05a_859.378_4.24.wav_ASR	then they'll be this thing doesn't really
kansas05a_864.8_5.88.wav_ASR	this isn't necessarily what's going on here but it's there
kansas05a_872.161_11.16.wav_ASR	here's the first mess the people the leave leave
kansas05a_888.045_3.84.wav_ASR	the person that's putting this stuff together
kansas05a_893.315_5.28.wav_ASR	he's got a person ready to help him with that
kansas05a_899.503_11.32.wav_ASR	here's an introduction to him from the people downstairs trying to put this together with a new set

kansas05a_1277.996_5.14.wav_ASR	yeah that's exactly the last day i was doing all of that together
kansas05a_1287.4_6.32.wav_ASR	well i hafta have the the place right here first
kansas05a_1294.091_1.156.wav_ASR	do this
kansas05a_1295.568_3.17.wav_ASR	and then you hafta have two years of that probably
kansas05a_1299.11_4.96.wav_ASR	you know you gotta have two two messages generally for the kind that you're going to have
kansas05a_1304.858_1.94.wav_ASR	and then you put it down there

71-1_282.906_4.581.wav_ASR	now that i haven't always been confusing other people
71-1_287.466_3.295.wav_ASR	and i do remember back what it was like when i was speaking before the stroke
71-1_291.106_1.62.wav_ASR	and people would look puzzled
71-1_293.566_0.577.wav_ASR	and then it was like
71-1_294.446_0.82.wav_ASR	what's their problem
71-1_295.586_5.857.wav_ASR	when they look puzzled a lot of times i said something that didn't make any sense
71-1_301.443_11.647.wav_ASR	so i'm still trying to work on explaining concepts of things to people and trying to correct myself when i make a mistake about the other
71-1_313.523_6.04.wav_ASR	and i do communicate on a regular basis
71-1_319.736_1.86.wav_ASR	so it's frustrating
71-1_321.916_8.864.wav_ASR	but i keep practicing it to the point that many people don't think i have aphasia until they do notice that i have aphasia
71-1_331.276_5.44.wav_ASR	so i can communicate but not well and not the way i useta be able to communicate
71-1_347.09_0.959.wav_ASR	oh very much
71-1_348.131_1.199.wav_ASR	you know better about it
71-1_350.191_0.82.wav_ASR	uhhuh
71-1_357.66_4.863.wav_ASR	well i didn't know that it was a stroke which is very typical
71-1_363.04_1.71.wav_ASR	oh no i had one before firstnamesb
71-1_364.78_1.964.wav_ASR	so how do i know what a stroke wise
71-1_366.88_4.114.wav_ASR	yes i was alphabet and working out
71-1_371.1_1.984.wav_ASR	it was january february
71-1_373.42_4.0.wav_ASR	you know that was a day when i you know that's the day when the restaurant stopped
71-1_377.8_1.688.wav_ASR	well i don't hafta get out there
71-1_379.52_2.533.wav_ASR	and i need to start working out again hard
71-1_382.16_0.893.wav_ASR	and i was at jackson
71-1_384.16_2.555.wav_ASR	and i worked the help out man
71-1_386.84_1.385.wav_ASR	and you know i think i did eight months
71-1_388.82_3.88.wav_ASR	and my heart was up to like a hundred and seven
71-1_393.18_0.64.wav_ASR	and i'm gone
71-1_394.24_0.819.wav_ASR	you keep this up
71-1_395.34_2.9.wav_ASR	and yeah i and i wasn't tired
71-1_398.62_0.92.wav_ASR	it wasn't firstnamet
71-1_400.16_11.482.wav_ASR	and i got off the alphabet and had double vowels and then fired i would walk for two more miles most because the black pennsylvania was on
71-1_412.0_1.26.wav_ASR	oh man
71-1_413.3_0.677.wav_ASR	but that was on
71-1_413.977_4.84.wav_ASR	and i thought i wanted to watch it because really like chopat
71-1_419.837_1.766.wav_ASR	you know what's the question
71-1_422.137_2.144.wav_ASR	and again i had double vision
71-1_425.157_2.023.wav_ASR	oh i just didn't feel good anymore
71-1_427.66_7.131.wav_ASR	went home and had a thunder clap heart right on my right side
71-1_434.94_0.52.wav_ASR	and i just said
71-1_435.94_1.381.wav_ASR	oh no i don't know how to do that
71-1_437.76_2.145.wav_ASR	so i crashed it and that'd be the end
71-1_440.66_2.93.wav_ASR	and the next day i couldn't work it on
71-1_443.78_1.7.wav_ASR	it was trying to a conference program
71-1_445.86_0.64.wav_ASR	nothing would
71-1_446.77_1.3.wav_ASR	and i couldn't do work
71-1_449.31_3.735.wav_ASR	so i went to my head my hair cut the next day
71-1_453.11_3.247.wav_ASR	and i wanted to cancel because i had a really bad headache
71-1_456.67_2.13.wav_ASR	but if you call firstnamesp you hadta pay for it
71-1_459.29_1.889.wav_ASR	and my hair will be cut
71-1_461.93_0.942.wav_ASR	oh i couldn't
71-1_462.93_1.662.wav_ASR	and i live alone
71-1_464.592_2.463.wav_ASR	so i didn't really talk anymore in two days
71-1_467.512_1.658.wav_ASR	you know in the church
71-1_469.572_2.734.wav_ASR	and i couldn't tell her how i wanted to get my hair cut
71-1_473.192_2.18.wav_ASR	and i couldn't say
71-1_476.352_4.42.wav_ASR	so i couldn't tell her that i'd been worried sick
71-1_481.512_1.76.wav_ASR	and i don't know what was coming
71-1_483.692_0.608.wav_ASR	it was tough
71-1_484.66_2.06.wav_ASR	and she was knitting and smiling
71-1_486.78_1.691.wav_ASR	well she had no idea what i was talking about
71-1_489.8_0.46.wav_ASR	oh i said
71-1_490.62_1.01.wav_ASR	well something's wrong
71-1_492.54_1.8.wav_ASR	so i told her
71-1_494.62_0.3.wav_ASR	and i said
71-1_495.129_0.678.wav_ASR	why are you here
71-1_497.02_2.56.wav_ASR	so she looks like she didn't have a history
71-1_499.94_1.89.wav_ASR	but she cut her hair the way i
71-1_502.08_0.3.wav_ASR	and i said
71-1_502.46_3.93.wav_ASR	you know better go a doctor because this doesn't make any sense
71-1_507.5_2.1.wav_ASR	so i i try
71-1_510.16_4.24.wav_ASR	and i think this is something that must happen with people that have strokes is that they
71-1_516.46_3.62.wav_ASR	well i looked up the number that i was supposed to call firstnamesc
71-1_520.22_1.589.wav_ASR	and this was already sixty plus
71-1_522.35_2.64.wav_ASR	and it had all of these triangles
71-1_526.21_3.46.wav_ASR	if it's an emergency emergency go call nine one one one one one one one
71-1_530.13_0.33.wav_ASR	and i thought
71-1_530.61_0.757.wav_ASR	that's
71-1_531.59_3.737.wav_ASR	well i just wanna make an appointment and go into the oral clinic more often
71-1_536.11_0.706.wav_ASR	and then it said
71-1_537.11_3.2.wav_ASR	if it's this situation called
71-1_540.703_4.014.wav_ASR	and if it's this situation called you know press three
71-1_545.023_2.16.wav_ASR	and if it's this situation called
71-1_548.083_3.82.wav_ASR	and apparently you stay on for two and half months they finally say
71-1_552.343_1.811.wav_ASR	real person will come on the line
71-1_555.283_1.601.wav_ASR	but my head really hurt
71-1_557.243_0.593.wav_ASR	and i'm just going
71-1_557.903_1.16.wav_ASR	well this is well
71-1_559.46_2.24.wav_ASR	so i hung up the phone and said
71-1_561.9_1.13.wav_ASR	well i'll just get up tomorrow morning
71-1_563.38_2.36.wav_ASR	you know if i anybody will ask the phone
71-1_566.68_1.06.wav_ASR	but i told my doctor
71-1_568.34_4.12.wav_ASR	and she she was very frightened
71-1_573.0_0.6.wav_ASR	you just sit
71-1_573.7_1.12.wav_ASR	don't sound so sure
71-1_576.13_1.22.wav_ASR	you need to go to an ambulance
71-1_577.9_1.29.wav_ASR	you know i'm gonna pay for an ambulance
71-1_579.24_0.78.wav_ASR	and it's just ridiculous
71-1_580.52_1.22.wav_ASR	yeah
71-1_581.84_0.82.wav_ASR	and i just have a headache
71-1_582.9_2.28.wav_ASR	and i don't wanna spend that much money
71-1_586.02_6.16.wav_ASR	and she and her partner they called the fire department
71-1_592.48_0.8.wav_ASR	he's an engineer
71-1_593.56_2.263.wav_ASR	and she's just finishing school up there
71-1_596.04_2.585.wav_ASR	and she they called the fire department firstnamem
71-1_598.625_1.419.wav_ASR	and and they said
71-1_601.165_2.74.wav_ASR	philosophically this is
71-1_604.725_1.16.wav_ASR	this is her mother
71-1_606.385_0.335.wav_ASR	and they said
71-1_607.54_1.23.wav_ASR	it sounds like she's having a stroke
71-1_609.285_2.315.wav_ASR	and she needs to get to the emergency room
71-1_613.76_1.04.wav_ASR	and and they said
71-1_614.845_1.205.wav_ASR	but she doesn't wanna go
71-1_616.36_0.52.wav_ASR	and they said
71-1_616.96_5.542.wav_ASR	all of a sudden i know is i'm living on my you know getting ready to teach them
71-1_623.14_4.643.wav_ASR	and i hear people running up the stairs outside my my apartment
71-1_628.28_4.927.wav_ASR	and firstnamer is really good looking fireman by the
71-1_633.62_2.12.wav_ASR	and i think it must be the university
71-1_636.04_0.645.wav_ASR	oh my gosh
71-1_637.365_1.928.wav_ASR	and i answered the door
71-1_639.285_1.265.wav_ASR	and i told them that
71-1_640.825_1.38.wav_ASR	well i didn't have it
71-1_642.545_1.252.wav_ASR	did not know what was going on
71-1_644.165_1.173.wav_ASR	and i couldn't talk
71-1_646.805_1.205.wav_ASR	you need to come out of this right now
71-1_648.285_0.355.wav_ASR	and i said
71-1_648.745_0.913.wav_ASR	well no i'll take it
71-1_650.705_0.335.wav_ASR	and they said
71-1_651.417_0.908.wav_ASR	you can't drive
71-1_653.105_1.585.wav_ASR	well i'm gonna go to maryland today
71-1_654.885_1.437.wav_ASR	you know you're gonna go to this right now
71-1_656.32_0.62.wav_ASR	oh my gosh
71-1_657.32_0.817.wav_ASR	alright alright
71-1_658.28_2.28.wav_ASR	well let me get my coat and all the other stuff
71-1_660.88_3.715.wav_ASR	yeah all of a sudden i got into the emergency room
71-1_664.74_1.961.wav_ASR	it was just this shoe
71-1_667.8_1.86.wav_ASR	it was raining around and yell
71-1_670.22_6.1.wav_ASR	and all of a sudden they called me in for a cat scan and came out and said
71-1_676.5_1.02.wav_ASR	yeah you had a stroke
71-1_678.32_2.727.wav_ASR	so i asked the doctor about it
71-1_681.06_3.681.wav_ASR	and he showed me on the cat scan exactly what it happened
71-1_685.44_3.23.wav_ASR	and they accidentally
71-1_689.38_2.962.wav_ASR	and so that's when i found out i had a stroke
71-1_692.75_6.56.wav_ASR	yeah i i really have no issues whatsoever with mice mice
71-1_699.81_1.65.wav_ASR	and i don't know
71-1_702.78_2.04.wav_ASR	and i just didn't know about the headache
71-1_705.03_0.95.wav_ASR	well never had one again
71-1_706.88_1.18.wav_ASR	never had them
71-1_708.53_7.93.wav_ASR	but apparently if you get a really bad headache that hits you on the side of the emergency room
71-1_717.45_2.54.wav_ASR	well i don't know if that gave you
71-1_720.582_1.363.wav_ASR	it doesn't give you a lot of insight
71-1_722.34_8.435.wav_ASR	can i remember right after i worked out when i had the headache it was most likely that they could have stopped it
71-1_731.3_3.77.wav_ASR	but at point the window of opportunity hadta
71-1_737.18_5.617.wav_ASR	but it wasn't a semantic stroke not a medical stroke
71-1_743.84_6.846.wav_ASR	and it they ultimately decided it was critical because they've not been able to find out why i had it
71-1_751.22_7.24.wav_ASR	all of my numbers are good
71-1_758.94_0.8.wav_ASR	and not die
71-1_760.32_0.82.wav_ASR	oh i don't know
71-1_762.02_1.88.wav_ASR	and i have a blood pressure
71-1_764.42_2.25.wav_ASR	everything looks
71-1_767.76_1.39.wav_ASR	but i did enjoy having a stroke
71-1_769.54_2.64.wav_ASR	so something happened sometime
71-1_772.78_3.16.wav_ASR	and and in the hospital i got to watch the insurance
71-1_776.46_0.954.wav_ASR	and it's just
71-1_780.18_0.96.wav_ASR	yeah right
71-1_781.58_4.48.wav_ASR	yeah so two years later here
71-1_797.2_17.56.wav_ASR	well if i ever get to use my physical sinuses aphasia and and firstnamer firstnamep and and firstnamerfirstnamep do something more about getting people kind of treated
71-1_814.772_2.553.wav_ASR	and i was given an almost nothing
71-1_817.552_3.086.wav_ASR	partly i think it was because
71-1_820.772_2.485.wav_ASR	and really matured is a major city
71-1_823.472_6.42.wav_ASR	so i should have been able to get the best type of help
71-1_830.372_0.477.wav_ASR	and i did
71-1_830.849_4.78.wav_ASR	and the best i could get was we found two speech therapists
71-1_836.569_2.232.wav_ASR	one of them only specializes in children
71-1_839.189_1.351.wav_ASR	so i didn't work with them
71-1_840.909_0.92.wav_ASR	other person
71-1_842.229_4.18.wav_ASR	and it was a little one hour a week or so
71-1_847.59_16.523.wav_ASR	and basically because i have an ecotrin prescription and because that part of my brain wasn't hurt because i had my own research
71-1_864.29_2.08.wav_ASR	and i hadta do a lot of things
71-1_866.55_4.28.wav_ASR	and at the the speech professional therapist
71-1_871.09_0.612.wav_ASR	very difficult
71-1_872.39_3.118.wav_ASR	and she helped me a lot i would say
71-1_875.61_2.902.wav_ASR	so i should be looking up this particular thing
71-1_878.63_2.25.wav_ASR	and i should be looking at the pictures
71-1_881.53_3.02.wav_ASR	and but she hadn't kept up with it either
71-1_884.71_4.16.wav_ASR	and she hadn't learned about some of the most recent treatments that were developed
71-1_889.53_7.52.wav_ASR	so basically what i did is i went back to exercise as soon as they allowed me
71-1_897.35_2.7.wav_ASR	and i couldn't work for three months
71-1_900.34_5.67.wav_ASR	because they were concerned that my physical activity had something to do with the stroke
71-1_906.42_0.66.wav_ASR	and she said
71-1_909.64_1.189.wav_ASR	well i just hadta walk
71-1_911.14_1.081.wav_ASR	and i had
71-1_913.2_1.401.wav_ASR	it tested me for aphasia
71-1_914.74_3.28.wav_ASR	and i hadta wear this for about three months
71-1_918.17_2.86.wav_ASR	but i don't have aphasia either so
71-1_921.33_2.315.wav_ASR	but i focus on driving
71-1_924.37_4.82.wav_ASR	really wasn't drinking much alcohol then anyway
71-1_930.27_1.38.wav_ASR	well i stopped to complain
71-1_932.87_2.66.wav_ASR	and so now i'm back exercise is much as i can
71-1_935.83_2.18.wav_ASR	and really care in terms of my diary
71-1_938.49_7.52.wav_ASR	and i really focus on immigration limiting it and terms of my diet and what i
71-1_947.57_2.29.wav_ASR	and i right every day
71-1_950.51_1.38.wav_ASR	oh i learned every day
71-1_951.89_3.934.wav_ASR	now i'm trying to write an article which i hope to get published
71-1_955.824_20.3.wav_ASR	because that may be the hardest thing for my brain that if ever hadta do before the stroke or until the early 2000s
71-1_976.405_1.819.wav_ASR	so i'm sorry
71-1_978.345_9.56.wav_ASR	and i read aloud every day the news papers because i think sentences words is a way of realizing those
71-1_988.605_2.865.wav_ASR	well it's the phones that were there
71-1_991.665_2.454.wav_ASR	well i just need to learn how to learn how to say a word
71-1_994.405_0.82.wav_ASR	little umbrella
71-1_995.479_4.388.wav_ASR	and i'll probably be able to say that a lot of time until the week
71-1_999.919_4.279.wav_ASR	and then i'll miss that one again
71-1_1005.119_5.531.wav_ASR	but that's really all i know how to do is keeping it up until
71-1_1011.439_0.611.wav_ASR	and sleeping
71-1_1012.379_2.191.wav_ASR	and i'm always asleep
71-1_1014.87_2.86.wav_ASR	actually have gone with it alone
71-1_1018.68_1.81.wav_ASR	you know if you stay late or doing something
71-1_1020.89_3.12.wav_ASR	well you stuff to get up because you have a class or you've got stuff to do
71-1_1024.67_8.638.wav_ASR	and i try to make sure i always have at least a day two or three hours a week to be able to sleep
71-1_1033.308_3.68.wav_ASR	and that seems to be something that i didn't needta do before
71-1_1037.181_1.688.wav_ASR	now i really do need to do
71-1_1038.968_2.762.wav_ASR	but that time door
71-1_1042.028_0.872.wav_ASR	still working
71-1_1043.248_1.404.wav_ASR	but i'm not able to teach
71-1_1045.089_3.024.wav_ASR	you can see what i would be like in ninety minutes
71-1_1048.268_0.89.wav_ASR	it gets fun for a kid
71-1_1049.328_0.769.wav_ASR	and they started talking
71-1_1050.288_0.602.wav_ASR	what do you call it
71-1_1051.388_0.52.wav_ASR	yes
71-1_1052.271_0.5.wav_ASR	yes
71-1_1054.451_1.998.wav_ASR	so maybe that'll come
71-1_1056.791_0.58.wav_ASR	and i can do
71-1_1058.051_3.74.wav_ASR	and i could teach through online and stuff
71-1_1062.471_2.149.wav_ASR	so far i'm just doing other stuff
71-1_1064.971_1.119.wav_ASR	and i did lots of teaching
71-1_1067.49_1.36.wav_ASR	well see i'm gonna get back to it again
71-1_1069.371_0.419.wav_ASR	and i don't know
71-1_1070.87_1.35.wav_ASR	and anyway so that's what i do
71-1_1072.81_4.64.wav_ASR	and and i think doing it consistently is really important
71-1_1077.79_2.66.wav_ASR	and i just kept pushing myself to do different things
71-1_1081.13_6.08.wav_ASR	there's little nothing that i'm not forcing myself to
71-1_1087.51_0.909.wav_ASR	not forcing myself
71-1_1088.69_2.265.wav_ASR	well certain things i go through every single day
71-1_1091.81_2.36.wav_ASR	and i do yoga every night
71-1_1094.51_1.1.wav_ASR	and i think that's useful
71-1_1096.57_1.69.wav_ASR	and i don't know
71-1_1098.26_19.94.wav_ASR	well i'm always looking at firstnamer always trying to find my hair and some of other things that's going to exercise my hair will be able to recover though that was disastrous
71-1_1119.04_7.42.wav_ASR	well i spent a few time trying to figure out why a right hand person the right side ended up with aphasia
71-1_1127.38_10.66.wav_ASR	but i mean other than the fact that doesn't follow me for many clinical trials
71-1_1138.248_3.801.wav_ASR	other than that i guess i just don't worry about it all that much
71-1_1142.228_13.0.wav_ASR	and just doing what i can tell to firstnamer to be able to take care of neuroplasticity to be able to take hold
71-1_1155.48_9.755.wav_ASR	well i do understand that at my age in my sixties firstnamem is last november is christmas
71-1_1165.72_1.66.wav_ASR	so i don't
71-1_1167.66_0.67.wav_ASR	well see what
71-1_1168.91_6.48.wav_ASR	just watch it every day this exercise and work or this work in practice and see how i
71-1_1175.93_2.077.wav_ASR	how it comes out and how it doesn't come out
71-1_1178.67_1.08.wav_ASR	well see yeah
71-1_1179.91_1.98.wav_ASR	well a lot of people don't know i have aphasia
71-1_1182.17_12.68.wav_ASR	and i like keeping at that way because the there's a disability even if it's an invisible even if it's an invisible
71-1_1196.42_8.392.wav_ASR	other people just think i miss spoke very carefully around me
71-1_1205.08_4.784.wav_ASR	so i i i remember just see if i can just wind it
71-1_1210.7_3.66.wav_ASR	so yeah very few people know that i have aphasia
71-1_1214.592_1.416.wav_ASR	well firstnamem remember
71-1_1216.008_3.437.wav_ASR	but i don't tell anyone else about it
71-1_1219.768_1.825.wav_ASR	it just tried to figure it out
71-1_1242.33_1.36.wav_ASR	and it should be something important
71-1_1246.83_4.6.wav_ASR	well you know i i guess i would
71-1_1251.764_12.94.wav_ASR	so something that i would say is working with me was working with nomanology who
71-1_1266.024_2.112.wav_ASR	well i'm very close to her
71-1_1268.136_3.957.wav_ASR	and i met firstnamee about ten years ago
71-1_1273.036_2.404.wav_ASR	and it's probably more fifteen years at this point
71-1_1276.336_2.78.wav_ASR	and i was teaching at a university
71-1_1279.476_1.38.wav_ASR	and i invited her to
71-1_1280.996_6.4.wav_ASR	was the advice of the national students organization because my research is on state trooples
71-1_1287.93_7.06.wav_ASR	and i had invited her to come and speak in one of my classes
71-1_1295.79_0.926.wav_ASR	and she came down
71-1_1297.17_2.48.wav_ASR	and we hit it off with firstnamese
71-1_1300.24_3.96.wav_ASR	and she was one of the most remarkable people that i ever met
71-1_1304.73_5.19.wav_ASR	and she was the oldest in a family of twelve
71-1_1310.55_3.42.wav_ASR	and she grew up on the ambulance without running water
71-1_1315.01_5.11.wav_ASR	and she was the first person to get a college degree from her try
71-1_1321.04_3.68.wav_ASR	and she became the first female traveler
71-1_1325.92_7.08.wav_ASR	and in the last ten years i would say we've gone on trips together
71-1_1333.92_3.12.wav_ASR	and i generally because as she's getting older she's under eighty
71-1_1337.32_0.87.wav_ASR	so she lets me do it
71-1_1339.05_7.74.wav_ASR	and you go to different events in which she's going to offer tests
71-1_1347.67_7.05.wav_ASR	and what i learned from hanging out with this woman who is independent is the word i would use
71-1_1355.21_1.06.wav_ASR	yeah
71-1_1356.984_2.503.wav_ASR	and she doesn't see that well anymore
71-1_1359.704_1.4.wav_ASR	just trouble reading anymore
71-1_1361.57_3.02.wav_ASR	but she has me right speech for her
71-1_1365.124_1.586.wav_ASR	and she gets up and presents them
71-1_1366.71_12.02.wav_ASR	and she refuses to to listen to the the response no
71-1_1379.45_3.74.wav_ASR	and she will find away to powder on through
71-1_1384.07_3.535.wav_ASR	and she gets things done that other people have not done
71-1_1387.89_9.96.wav_ASR	and why i see this important mother is very positive and very kind and believe that you deserve two men
71-1_1398.43_12.315.wav_ASR	and hanging out with a couple of people about what it means to be a powerful woman when you say something
71-1_1411.09_1.635.wav_ASR	and just got up
71-1_1412.95_0.663.wav_ASR	see firstnamesu
71-1_1414.29_1.84.wav_ASR	and presented yourself
71-1_1416.263_8.47.wav_ASR	and firstnamel and firstnamel that you can leave everything through you wanna get things through you wanna get through
71-1_1424.733_14.14.wav_ASR	so working with firstnamea over the last couple years we've been able to stop a mind from the numbness which would've been really difficult
71-1_1440.7_6.776.wav_ASR	so she has been my insurance until what i learned from her
71-1_1447.78_1.68.wav_ASR	you know it's really fun
71-1_1449.92_2.26.wav_ASR	so there's that other thing
71-1_1452.86_0.96.wav_ASR	and that's it
71-1_1454.02_6.652.wav_ASR	and she's been an oncologist for me i think to follow myself after
71-1_1514.123_7.78.wav_ASR	well i mean it looks like a bird who's playing with a soccer ball
71-1_1522.3_7.984.wav_ASR	and he's on his own probably in this yard because this is something that he's really interested in doing
71-1_1530.81_8.77.wav_ASR	and he kicked the ball maybe a little bit too hard
71-1_1540.7_3.8.wav_ASR	and it broke in to the window next door
71-1_1545.58_2.64.wav_ASR	and unfortunately he broke the window
71-1_1549.0_11.31.wav_ASR	and the ball came through the window right next door neighbor a man is sitting on his chair
71-1_1561.7_4.32.wav_ASR	so he's obviously really upset about this because he could have been hurt
71-1_1566.34_1.16.wav_ASR	and the glass is broken
71-1_1568.22_1.04.wav_ASR	and it's in his g
71-1_1569.74_1.088.wav_ASR	and it should have happened
71-1_1571.64_7.02.wav_ASR	and so he grabs the chair looks out the window to find the cover who did this to him
71-1_1578.75_3.64.wav_ASR	and now they're going to be some kind of
71-1_1582.51_3.18.wav_ASR	he's gonna need some kind of rehabilitation that are made in a hospital
71-1_1585.938_20.64.wav_ASR	he looks like he's about ready to head over grab grab the umbrella and the poor boy would never do the same thing again would stay away from the window
71-1_1623.92_0.5.wav_ASR	oh
71-1_1624.855_4.46.wav_ASR	well it looks as if this little
71-1_1630.595_1.88.wav_ASR	let's see let's see
71-1_1632.686_1.727.wav_ASR	hard actually it could be kind of
71-1_1635.675_3.5.wav_ASR	and i can't decide if it's male or female
71-1_1639.515_3.031.wav_ASR	and i'm saying
71-1_1643.288_9.44.wav_ASR	they're getting ready to head out to the library somewhere some trip somewhere
71-1_1653.76_5.85.wav_ASR	and their mother looked outside and said
71-1_1660.248_1.642.wav_ASR	you know i think we're gonna see some rain
71-1_1662.48_1.17.wav_ASR	you might need the umbrella
71-1_1664.82_1.11.wav_ASR	but this child said
71-1_1666.34_1.55.wav_ASR	you don't need an umbrella
71-1_1668.44_1.2.wav_ASR	you mean this is rehabilitation
71-1_1669.94_0.6.wav_ASR	it's not gonna rain
71-1_1670.78_1.68.wav_ASR	and i don't really care about getting wet
71-1_1672.82_0.87.wav_ASR	you know i don't
71-1_1674.76_0.73.wav_ASR	oh no like shoe
71-1_1675.74_1.68.wav_ASR	they don't melt when the water hits
71-1_1678.28_1.97.wav_ASR	so this this children
71-1_1680.78_0.88.wav_ASR	and leaving anyway
71-1_1681.66_1.72.wav_ASR	my firstnamesb is firstnameb
71-1_1683.529_1.775.wav_ASR	and immediately began raining
71-1_1686.38_1.31.wav_ASR	all of a sudden cinderella
71-1_1688.02_4.78.wav_ASR	hey i'm getting rain drops in my eyes
71-1_1693.33_1.4.wav_ASR	and i'm getting really wet
71-1_1695.36_1.22.wav_ASR	and this is not
71-1_1697.22_2.14.wav_ASR	they didn't understand that it would get in my eyes
71-1_1700.24_4.96.wav_ASR	so i immediately hit it back because it was raining much harder than i thought it was
71-1_1706.08_0.654.wav_ASR	walk down
71-1_1706.84_0.896.wav_ASR	two daughters
71-1_1708.14_1.485.wav_ASR	well i just looked at her
71-1_1710.54_2.22.wav_ASR	her course knew that i was right
71-1_1713.18_11.1.wav_ASR	well the mother immediately understood that while it was very difficult for this child to ask for this child that they were wrong
71-1_1725.08_5.08.wav_ASR	they did make sure that they're gonna be walking to school if they're gonna be walking to school
71-1_1730.64_3.56.wav_ASR	so the mother then gave them the umbrella
71-1_1734.68_10.14.wav_ASR	and they went back on their way with an umbrella remember know what their thoughts about these people
71-1_1761.65_0.5.wav_ASR	you
71-1_1762.547_29.94.wav_ASR	well what happens is that the cat and nobody knew how to get off the tree but no longer know how to get back from the end of the branch that
71-1_1800.778_0.579.wav_ASR	help me
71-1_1802.158_0.382.wav_ASR	me
71-1_1802.54_6.1.wav_ASR	and the little girl is obviously just really enjoying about the situation of her
71-1_1808.838_1.772.wav_ASR	and she's very worried about getting her cat out
71-1_1811.358_5.082.wav_ASR	so she began by going to her father and saying
71-1_1816.78_4.1.wav_ASR	can you please help me get the cat out of the tree
71-1_1820.94_4.437.wav_ASR	and the boy and the girl
71-1_1825.6_0.417.wav_ASR	four years
71-1_1826.1_18.22.wav_ASR	and he grabbed his ladder and climbed up to the the limb where the cat was because those branches are too fragile
71-1_1845.67_8.6.wav_ASR	he also kicked off the ladder which then puts him back in the situation that he needs to be rescued
71-1_1855.03_5.868.wav_ASR	so at this point the dog is now barking because the dog wants the father to get out of the tree
71-1_1861.6_10.368.wav_ASR	the barking of the dog is making it more difficult for the cat to be able to exercise now down to the trunk
71-1_1872.9_8.052.wav_ASR	so far the little girl is still really stressed because her child her cat is at
71-1_1880.952_2.68.wav_ASR	that's a semicircle aphasia area
71-1_1883.772_0.899.wav_ASR	make that all the time
71-1_1885.192_3.057.wav_ASR	is really wants her cat to be able to get out
71-1_1888.249_17.88.wav_ASR	so they call the fire department to come down and not just rescue the cat but also rescued
71-1_1906.179_13.419.wav_ASR	but it doesn't actually shows that the father was really trying to do whatever his daughter wanted him to do in terms of help get the cat out of the tree
71-1_1939.75_0.39.wav_ASR	shower
71-1_2104.158_2.744.wav_ASR	well i'll keep the telephone number of it
71-1_2107.478_3.16.wav_ASR	and that'll be next time around
71-1_2113.118_0.492.wav_ASR	you
71-1_2113.85_8.89.wav_ASR	firstnamec is she's the daughter of a
71-1_2123.66_2.76.wav_ASR	her mother has been killed
71-1_2127.23_2.66.wav_ASR	and so the two of them are
71-1_2131.04_13.9.wav_ASR	and the her father decides that it would be really helpful for his daughter if he could provide a mother for his daughter cinderella
71-1_2146.02_1.74.wav_ASR	so he met this
71-1_2149.12_2.03.wav_ASR	and i don't know that we've ever heard her name
71-1_2151.74_3.0.wav_ASR	but anyway other wise know it
71-1_2155.58_6.48.wav_ASR	made very clear that she would be a wonderful mother to cinderella
71-1_2162.44_1.851.wav_ASR	and she also had two daughters of her own
71-1_2165.48_1.34.wav_ASR	all they
71-1_2167.42_10.34.wav_ASR	and unfortunately the way that cinderella was treated was not appropriate
71-1_2178.36_5.417.wav_ASR	and she was not treated the same way that these stepmother's were treated
71-1_2183.777_4.48.wav_ASR	and and in step she was used as a maid
71-1_2188.336_5.469.wav_ASR	and and i have no idea where her father is in this whole picture and why he's not doing anything about this
71-1_2194.037_3.593.wav_ASR	but maybe he's traveling or whatever
71-1_2197.83_17.72.wav_ASR	but he's left the middle of his daughter to the stepmother who treats her very badly doesn't treat cinderella
71-1_2216.67_10.5.wav_ASR	so she effectively becomes the maid to these two stepsisters and to a stepmother
71-1_2228.39_5.92.wav_ASR	but she she's a very very sweet young woman
71-1_2235.23_16.92.wav_ASR	and she has found a way to also have happiness relationships with the animals because that's one of her jobs is to make sure that the animals are fed
71-1_2252.39_1.84.wav_ASR	so she sings to
71-1_2255.14_0.93.wav_ASR	they love her
71-1_2256.32_5.39.wav_ASR	and she's close to the the horses the other animals
71-1_2262.1_9.26.wav_ASR	and she dreams about being a better situation where she's lucky with more respect than she is
71-1_2271.67_11.59.wav_ASR	well she's also quite beautiful which is certainly one of the reasons why the stepsisters are so mean to her because they
71-1_2284.39_18.53.wav_ASR	but well this is going in in this house hold the king because maybe it closer to his son because the king would like to retire
71-1_2303.08_7.52.wav_ASR	and he liked to hand down the cinderella to his son
71-1_2311.32_1.88.wav_ASR	but firstnamesj has to marry
71-1_2313.84_2.509.wav_ASR	and he doesn't really want it
71-1_2316.62_1.587.wav_ASR	he's not interested in any one
71-1_2318.34_1.38.wav_ASR	you're not dating anymore
71-1_2320.22_3.01.wav_ASR	but the plan is that this is his daughter
71-1_2324.16_3.094.wav_ASR	it was kind of like the prince harry of that time
71-1_2327.3_3.0.wav_ASR	and the fire and not well
71-1_2331.06_5.74.wav_ASR	but in any case the phone is that's gonna be a janet ball dance
71-1_2336.832_13.545.wav_ASR	and all of the elementary which i guess means firstnamesc is supposed to show up at this dance so that he can pick the one that he wants
71-1_2350.732_4.303.wav_ASR	and again we'll not get into philadelphia how this all worked
71-1_2356.58_2.034.wav_ASR	and certainly the word gets out
71-1_2359.36_6.948.wav_ASR	and the two stepsisters are just really excited about this idea because they're the right age
71-1_2366.94_9.235.wav_ASR	because their mother had married cinderella's father who makes a fair amount of money they can dress really well
71-1_2376.175_11.163.wav_ASR	well they can really get dress up to go to this dance and see if they could be the one that would attract the attention of the prince
71-1_2388.615_1.676.wav_ASR	firstnamec cinderella wants to go
71-1_2390.815_3.322.wav_ASR	and she also reads about this that that is coming in
71-1_2394.137_3.18.wav_ASR	and that she knows ella because she's the right age
71-1_2397.537_6.18.wav_ASR	and i guess she's of that nationality or whatever criteria they're users
71-1_2404.5_6.33.wav_ASR	but her stepmother kind of makes clear that no she she's not invited to go
71-1_2411.78_5.16.wav_ASR	well she's not gonna be able to go to stores and buy clothes the way
71-1_2417.82_2.25.wav_ASR	so she tries to make something out of her own
71-1_2420.4_3.38.wav_ASR	and she tries to take the medications and the radicals
71-1_2424.24_4.62.wav_ASR	he looks up how to make them in a walk
71-1_2429.36_1.08.wav_ASR	it was on page twelve
71-1_2430.56_1.38.wav_ASR	that's what was going on
71-1_2432.61_1.33.wav_ASR	and she comes up with the dress
71-1_2434.24_1.5.wav_ASR	and of course she looks amazing
71-1_2436.71_9.244.wav_ASR	just were pretty and ping the phone with a umbrella rain hat while she got away with it
71-1_2446.2_1.78.wav_ASR	well this is not
71-1_2449.65_1.12.wav_ASR	this is cinderella
71-1_2450.992_2.458.wav_ASR	so her mother left her and says
71-1_2453.57_1.49.wav_ASR	you're not going out with those clothes
71-1_2455.45_2.61.wav_ASR	and her stepsisters mock her
71-1_2458.95_2.32.wav_ASR	and she's out in the barn by her
71-1_2462.19_9.66.wav_ASR	and all of a sudden this fairy godmother shows up base on one of her wishes
71-1_2472.03_2.42.wav_ASR	well i wish i could go to the ball
71-1_2475.65_12.128.wav_ASR	and she the recent that the harvard is showing up as because she knows that cinderella is a really sweet young girl
71-1_2488.53_2.041.wav_ASR	and she cares about everybody else
71-1_2490.87_1.674.wav_ASR	and she does things for everybody else
71-1_2492.544_4.96.wav_ASR	and because of her heart she decides this dance
71-1_2498.584_2.36.wav_ASR	so she uses her magical power
71-1_2502.18_6.324.wav_ASR	and she not only rates a dress for her that is incredibly ornate
71-1_2509.124_2.72.wav_ASR	you can go to the surgeries with
71-1_2511.9_14.753.wav_ASR	but she also turns the mice into horses and the pumpkin into carriage to be able to take her so that she can get there
71-1_2526.84_2.1.wav_ASR	and she can ride in style
71-1_2529.78_4.64.wav_ASR	so cinderella is very happy hugs her
71-1_2534.78_0.88.wav_ASR	and her grandmother said
71-1_2535.86_5.98.wav_ASR	remember this only last this dream will only last until midnight
71-1_2542.26_4.463.wav_ASR	at midnight your dress will go back to your rag
71-1_2546.723_5.94.wav_ASR	you're forces will go back will be transported back into
71-1_2554.163_6.318.wav_ASR	and the cops will be or the cars will be turned back into a pumpkin
71-1_2561.13_0.573.wav_ASR	and she said
71-1_2561.943_0.442.wav_ASR	so i know
71-1_2562.423_0.792.wav_ASR	thank you very much
71-1_2563.463_3.157.wav_ASR	so she helps to the
71-1_2567.38_17.24.wav_ASR	and of course because she's so elegant type and shows up with this really real tired her
71-1_2584.975_2.916.wav_ASR	and she the put man opens the door
71-1_2588.095_0.812.wav_ASR	help her
71-1_2589.635_0.812.wav_ASR	and she walks in there
71-1_2590.635_2.32.wav_ASR	and immediately the prince just like
71-1_2593.435_0.658.wav_ASR	like like that
71-1_2594.515_2.3.wav_ASR	it's like he's been struck by lightning
71-1_2597.575_1.165.wav_ASR	see the one i wanna be
71-1_2598.975_1.165.wav_ASR	he hits over to her
71-1_2600.475_2.06.wav_ASR	and there's an incident
71-1_2604.46_2.0.wav_ASR	he dances with her the internet
71-1_2606.82_5.16.wav_ASR	he's pretty clear that maybe at this point firstnamem is the worst thing in the world if i get to be with this one
71-1_2613.19_4.0.wav_ASR	and she's and all of a sudden at this point she's pulling away
71-1_2617.56_0.34.wav_ASR	and she said
71-1_2618.12_0.46.wav_ASR	and i got a
71-1_2618.76_0.34.wav_ASR	and he says
71-1_2619.22_1.32.wav_ASR	you know stick around
71-1_2620.94_0.6.wav_ASR	you got food
71-1_2622.58_0.6.wav_ASR	and they're sitting there
71-1_2624.18_1.12.wav_ASR	and she says
71-1_2625.6_0.71.wav_ASR	oh i gotta get back
71-1_2626.5_0.52.wav_ASR	you gotta go
71-1_2627.3_5.8.wav_ASR	and she runs away at about two or three months to midnight because her shoe
71-1_2633.26_1.166.wav_ASR	and i got this curse
71-1_2634.56_0.786.wav_ASR	and i got to go away
71-1_2635.38_1.167.wav_ASR	and she raises away
71-1_2637.7_2.81.wav_ASR	all of a sudden she's really fast
71-1_2640.94_0.44.wav_ASR	so she says
71-1_2641.38_4.57.wav_ASR	way but all the sense that one of her shoes has been left there
71-1_2646.16_0.98.wav_ASR	glass slipper
71-1_2647.86_2.174.wav_ASR	and so he picks it up
71-1_2650.2_3.24.wav_ASR	all these got her is this glass slipper
71-1_2654.1_2.56.wav_ASR	so he goes back to his father and says
71-1_2657.28_1.28.wav_ASR	oh i'll marry somebody
71-1_2658.86_1.868.wav_ASR	well there's only one woman i wanna marry
71-1_2660.728_1.516.wav_ASR	and she's the one i wanna marry
71-1_2662.968_4.68.wav_ASR	and all i have is this clue that her foot will fit into this
71-1_2668.928_2.54.wav_ASR	they started arriving around the kingdom
71-1_2672.608_7.36.wav_ASR	one that one who who's feet will fit into these slippers the prince will be cinderella
71-1_2680.85_7.16.wav_ASR	so oh my god all these stepsisters who you know they were aware at the ball
71-1_2688.27_2.82.wav_ASR	but they're pretty sure they get their feet into this slipper
71-1_2692.05_1.6.wav_ASR	he one of the children
71-1_2694.54_19.21.wav_ASR	so she's and of course at this point cinderella is back doing her work taking care of her family
71-1_2714.59_1.81.wav_ASR	so the prince started driving around
71-1_2716.91_4.25.wav_ASR	well and it's this really bizarre sort of thing that he's driving around
71-1_2721.43_10.724.wav_ASR	people are running out of their shoes and seeing if they're feet will fit into this one single one
71-1_2733.67_1.9.wav_ASR	and he hops up and he stops at their house
71-1_2735.77_6.34.wav_ASR	he's really distressed at this point because he hasn't yet found a woman who's afraid will fit into that slipper
71-1_2743.01_1.095.wav_ASR	he stops at this house
71-1_2744.37_2.793.wav_ASR	well the stepsisters do everything they can
71-1_2747.29_3.08.wav_ASR	but their feet are just two big or too long or too long
71-1_2750.71_0.798.wav_ASR	it's not working
71-1_2751.632_3.22.wav_ASR	and then all of a sudden
71-1_2755.261_2.278.wav_ASR	he's just about ready to leave
71-1_2757.592_1.74.wav_ASR	and all of a sudden he sees a movement
71-1_2760.172_5.59.wav_ASR	and he sees this other woman like the maid who's just in the corner
71-1_2766.572_0.428.wav_ASR	and he said
71-1_2767.252_0.588.wav_ASR	don't hurt
71-1_2768.83_1.36.wav_ASR	and the stepmother said
71-1_2770.312_0.798.wav_ASR	oh no she's not
71-1_2771.5_0.97.wav_ASR	shoes are made
71-1_2773.43_1.84.wav_ASR	and she looks up
71-1_2775.92_5.43.wav_ASR	and he the prince just has this strange feeling about her and
71-1_2781.92_1.44.wav_ASR	well i like to have her come out
71-1_2783.78_7.311.wav_ASR	and i like to see if her feet will fit her feet
71-1_2791.091_2.035.wav_ASR	and so she comes in
71-1_2793.371_0.92.wav_ASR	and she's a mac
71-1_2794.711_3.639.wav_ASR	you know she's been working in the kitchen and in the bathroom
71-1_2798.931_6.2.wav_ASR	and she's not looking anyway like the princess person that had been at the palace
71-1_2805.87_0.8.wav_ASR	but she came out
71-1_2806.831_0.759.wav_ASR	and she sat down
71-1_2808.51_3.56.wav_ASR	the prince put the slipper on her foot
71-1_2812.99_1.08.wav_ASR	and it fits
71-1_2814.73_0.98.wav_ASR	and then he looked at her
71-1_2815.71_22.48.wav_ASR	and what was remarkable is that she met her at all of the first time even if she had shown the first time even if she was clearly not aware of the same stress that she had assumed
71-1_2839.43_15.337.wav_ASR	so they lived happily ever after until firstnamer firstnamee somebody not liked the cinderella because she was not satisfied
71-1_2854.767_18.19.wav_ASR	and he hadta enroll in and go to other conferences about his condition and make sure they make money firstnamesp and take money
71-1_2872.957_0.84.wav_ASR	alright
71-1_2874.864_1.272.wav_ASR	oh yes
71-1_2900.37_0.5.wav_ASR	okay
71-1_2905.61_1.0.wav_ASR	oh oh
71-1_2910.67_11.58.wav_ASR	and i'm interested really interested thing about clocks to me recently is that i went to a physical check
71-1_2923.03_2.831.wav_ASR	and i just turned sixty five
71-1_2926.39_2.52.wav_ASR	and so i never experienced this before
71-1_2929.05_5.28.wav_ASR	and i thought it was my university philadelphia
71-1_2935.52_1.03.wav_ASR	and i walked around
71-1_2936.75_0.57.wav_ASR	and i sat down
71-1_2937.65_2.34.wav_ASR	and nurses checking my blood pressure
71-1_2940.41_4.62.wav_ASR	you know the my heart rate my pulse and all the other stuff
71-1_2945.73_3.06.wav_ASR	and then she handed me a piece of paper and a pen and said
71-1_2948.98_1.34.wav_ASR	and i like to draw a clock
71-1_2951.06_1.01.wav_ASR	you know what i'm saying
71-1_2953.58_0.57.wav_ASR	and she said
71-1_2954.34_3.38.wav_ASR	because i i wanna see what kind of picture you you can draw
71-1_2958.32_2.76.wav_ASR	so it seems ridiculous
71-1_2961.62_1.027.wav_ASR	and i did it anyway
71-1_2963.0_0.93.wav_ASR	oh i do
71-1_2964.52_9.32.wav_ASR	and i knew how to handle a picture properly with a clock which is first you put down the twelve
71-1_2974.0_0.89.wav_ASR	and then you put them together
71-1_2975.14_0.66.wav_ASR	and you put the two together
71-1_2975.98_0.71.wav_ASR	and they put the knife
71-1_2976.74_8.82.wav_ASR	and then you fell the number so that everything is locked where it should be and not having them too crowded
71-1_2986.12_3.09.wav_ASR	and then i hadta draw the pictures of two forty five
71-1_2990.32_1.08.wav_ASR	and i finished
71-1_2991.6_0.4.wav_ASR	and i said
71-1_2992.42_1.46.wav_ASR	well is this what you want
71-1_2994.75_4.17.wav_ASR	or do you wanna just look at what you have on the wall that's right there which is a
71-1_2999.82_0.95.wav_ASR	and she said
71-1_3001.11_2.02.wav_ASR	well you have passed this test
71-1_3003.49_0.32.wav_ASR	and i says
71-1_3004.28_1.87.wav_ASR	you know it's a cinderella desu
71-1_3006.254_13.939.wav_ASR	that when you're sixty five and you go to a hospital for an ultrasound check you will have to draw a clot
71-1_3020.834_0.477.wav_ASR	and i said
71-1_3021.514_2.193.wav_ASR	one point while they stopped doing this
71-1_3023.76_9.43.wav_ASR	because while i did enjoy grew up with the you know the round shot right
71-1_3033.8_1.68.wav_ASR	everything i do is disney
71-1_3035.807_16.95.wav_ASR	so what happens at what dimension will do that you do not have dementia or whatever and that you somebody understands of what time is
71-1_3053.5_2.36.wav_ASR	well anyway if i do it i'm not gonna do it
71-1_3056.16_6.11.wav_ASR	you know i'm just gonna make sure with them and just put down some digital stuff and see what they do
71-1_3062.88_3.78.wav_ASR	you know my p e r or something like bruised welsh
71-1_3066.9_2.818.wav_ASR	and anyway it's it's a test that they do
71-1_3069.718_3.888.wav_ASR	and i found it really irritating though i passed
71-1_3074.018_3.915.wav_ASR	it's it's gonna be upset very quickly
71-1_3078.438_1.048.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
71-1_3084.638_1.963.wav_ASR	oh let me see
71-1_3091.487_18.88.wav_ASR	one of the things i useta do when my daughter was younger is everyone the first week and january we would head together to watch the email watch
71-1_3110.83_14.71.wav_ASR	and what the evil watch was is one place that in january there's one place that is on the way somewhere else
71-1_3125.67_0.72.wav_ASR	they're coming back
71-1_3126.63_1.247.wav_ASR	they're going south or something
71-1_3127.877_5.666.wav_ASR	but they'll show up in this lake for about three or four days
71-1_3134.157_8.44.wav_ASR	and so what people do is they have groups the auditorium and other groups that show up with
71-1_3144.23_4.65.wav_ASR	and we watch the the birds the eggs because you can see them
71-1_3149.19_1.113.wav_ASR	you're really really close
71-1_3150.45_1.46.wav_ASR	you can see the
71-1_3152.49_1.454.wav_ASR	and you can see them with their mother
71-1_3154.33_2.28.wav_ASR	and there's just so many of them at one time
71-1_3157.17_2.038.wav_ASR	it was monday we have a lot of hospitals
71-1_3159.43_4.8.wav_ASR	but we don't necessarily see balls as much
71-1_3164.36_1.23.wav_ASR	it's much more rare
71-1_3166.48_4.788.wav_ASR	that's that something that we did for a number of years
71-1_3171.36_2.94.wav_ASR	even when she was thirty and wasn't really talking to me anymore
71-1_3174.98_2.763.wav_ASR	we always had fun on that day
71-1_3177.96_0.725.wav_ASR	you know how to show it
71-1_3179.02_3.122.wav_ASR	first she dressed really warm because it's gonna be twenty below
71-1_3182.59_3.58.wav_ASR	we would go to the bank with nick
71-1_3186.63_2.08.wav_ASR	we would wait for the email to show up
71-1_3188.91_1.44.wav_ASR	we would watch them for awhile
71-1_3190.65_2.38.wav_ASR	and we would go home college
71-1_3193.31_2.86.wav_ASR	and she'll talk to me that time
71-1_3196.61_2.19.wav_ASR	when we were home then it was
71-1_3199.11_0.88.wav_ASR	oh god she's my
71-1_3200.21_0.568.wav_ASR	now not talking
71-1_3200.778_1.896.wav_ASR	one of them talked to my friends
71-1_3202.738_13.726.wav_ASR	but there was always that one period even in those very difficult years that my always talked to me after we watched the emails
71-1_3216.464_5.16.wav_ASR	so that's one of the things that i would think of when i think of the word bird
71-1_3227.38_1.01.wav_ASR	what was the word again
71-1_3230.244_2.56.wav_ASR	well i don't know if you wanna hear that story
71-1_3233.039_0.485.wav_ASR	oh my god
71-1_3233.991_2.78.wav_ASR	well i okay
71-1_3236.777_13.094.wav_ASR	well i can tell you a recent one that will not be right there because really when you're trying to get married or anything like that
71-1_3250.021_10.775.wav_ASR	and i'll talk about something i did last summer and since my stroke i've been trying to push myself a little bit
71-1_3260.881_2.569.wav_ASR	and again i'm much more tired than i useta be
71-1_3263.61_5.251.wav_ASR	but i'm still trying push my boundaries to find out exactly what's possible
71-1_3268.93_1.28.wav_ASR	well and how much can i do
71-1_3270.29_1.827.wav_ASR	and how long i drove
71-1_3272.13_3.6.wav_ASR	and how many hours a day can i you know be active
71-1_3275.741_2.789.wav_ASR	and so i worked with this nonproportion
71-1_3279.53_5.7.wav_ASR	and we were having a event in northern wisconsin off the noman region
71-1_3285.397_2.48.wav_ASR	and it's a our group is called wave
71-1_3289.337_1.68.wav_ASR	we do with firstnamee my firstnamem firstnamee
71-1_3291.677_3.779.wav_ASR	so i i had a headache for this well firstnamew
71-1_3295.737_1.06.wav_ASR	and i hadta get up
71-1_3296.957_5.26.wav_ASR	think i left town had five to get up there by eight
71-1_3302.331_5.519.wav_ASR	we had a visit all day long and talking and you know different things going on
71-1_3307.891_1.32.wav_ASR	it was really hard
71-1_3310.051_3.538.wav_ASR	and i was ready to drive home by five o'clock by five o'clock
71-1_3314.151_2.269.wav_ASR	and about an hour on the
71-1_3317.011_2.559.wav_ASR	three or four hours at three and a half hour
71-1_3319.71_2.98.wav_ASR	but i can't drive anymore today
71-1_3323.47_1.68.wav_ASR	my head was just
71-1_3326.15_3.68.wav_ASR	and i needed to sleep really quickly
71-1_3329.87_2.42.wav_ASR	and i learned to listen to myself
71-1_3332.61_4.86.wav_ASR	my body says you're tired you'll pull over and you run
71-1_3337.649_5.112.wav_ASR	you don't just look around three and drink some coffee and you keep on going
71-1_3343.27_1.34.wav_ASR	so i pulled into this hotel
71-1_3345.85_1.66.wav_ASR	it i like them a lot
71-1_3347.849_3.041.wav_ASR	you know i didn't have a reservation or anything
71-1_3351.11_9.614.wav_ASR	and i was just looking for a place that had an opening so i could go in and get out of my eyes and not hafta drive anymore
71-1_3360.85_10.96.wav_ASR	but because i was as tired as i was and because i was put to my bedroom my aphasia had clearly blurred
71-1_3372.95_2.18.wav_ASR	so i walked in this house
71-1_3375.69_3.36.wav_ASR	and there were lots of animals
71-1_3379.64_2.57.wav_ASR	well actually i didn't know that at all
71-1_3382.66_1.98.wav_ASR	but i thought it said baltimore
71-1_3385.14_0.809.wav_ASR	but i wasn't sure
71-1_3386.18_0.937.wav_ASR	well i walked in the door
71-1_3388.0_2.42.wav_ASR	and there's a woman behind the the desk
71-1_3390.82_0.48.wav_ASR	and i said
71-1_3391.54_2.24.wav_ASR	you know i'm here for a room
71-1_3394.62_0.32.wav_ASR	and i said
71-1_3395.02_1.08.wav_ASR	do you have any questions
71-1_3397.62_5.68.wav_ASR	and and of course that's what happens with aphasia is you see words
71-1_3403.92_3.86.wav_ASR	and now academics couldn't have been a professor
71-1_3408.16_3.161.wav_ASR	and people are wearing masks
71-1_3411.64_1.783.wav_ASR	and they're being very careful about that
71-1_3413.72_2.58.wav_ASR	but of course i was trying to say
71-1_3416.34_1.56.wav_ASR	do you have a
71-1_3418.62_1.778.wav_ASR	you know what you know is
71-1_3420.7_1.02.wav_ASR	you have aphasia
71-1_3422.16_3.26.wav_ASR	and the went into her computer program
71-1_3426.26_1.62.wav_ASR	yeah everybody here's been fantastic
71-1_3428.38_0.711.wav_ASR	all we know is mom
71-1_3429.38_0.988.wav_ASR	wait a minute everything down
71-1_3430.72_0.54.wav_ASR	and i'm just saying
71-1_3431.88_0.98.wav_ASR	so you have a room
71-1_3433.14_0.664.wav_ASR	and she said
71-1_3433.92_1.033.wav_ASR	yes yes yes yes
71-1_3435.16_0.545.wav_ASR	don't worry
71-1_3435.705_1.0.wav_ASR	we follow code
71-1_3436.845_0.623.wav_ASR	and don't worry about it
71-1_3437.565_1.797.wav_ASR	oh you're not gonna get it here
71-1_3439.805_1.863.wav_ASR	and she gave me a umbrella
71-1_3441.825_6.66.wav_ASR	and i realize that was one way to cure things up is you just go with it you know
71-1_3448.76_1.911.wav_ASR	we wanna see if she had aphasia
71-1_3451.44_0.31.wav_ASR	and i said
71-1_3452.165_0.98.wav_ASR	you have a back
71-1_3453.98_1.77.wav_ASR	and so we just went with back and forth
71-1_3456.24_2.03.wav_ASR	and then finally my way back to school
71-1_3459.14_2.56.wav_ASR	you have an email room that i can sleep in
71-1_3462.68_5.02.wav_ASR	so i got the room went in drunk a lot of cold water and literally slept for twelve hours
71-1_3468.94_0.48.wav_ASR	yeah
71-1_3471.54_2.08.wav_ASR	so that's another stroke
71-1_3478.5_0.5.wav_ASR	okay
71-1_3480.14_0.8.wav_ASR	oh
71-1_3481.62_20.94.wav_ASR	and i guess if i were going to choose something to talk about how i paid my way through my university i would talk about firstnamesc and firstnamesc
71-1_3504.63_14.68.wav_ASR	and i raced beginning at kind of a little cop that was near where i lived because i had no car
71-1_3520.12_1.31.wav_ASR	and i could just bike there
71-1_3522.42_1.45.wav_ASR	and they were very kind
71-1_3524.03_2.94.wav_ASR	and i did the breakfast
71-1_3528.1_14.32.wav_ASR	but i learned very quickly after about six months that you would get paid ten to fifty percent as a tip based on the prices of the restaurants
71-1_3543.14_8.24.wav_ASR	what made sense was to find the restaurant that was the most expensive in terms of prices and where there
71-1_3552.167_3.873.wav_ASR	you doing the exact same part of firstnamesc
71-1_3556.39_19.218.wav_ASR	if they're only paying five dollars for their medicals for their health and their pay you two or four dollars for it
71-1_3575.98_5.36.wav_ASR	so what i learned to do is keep going to more and more emotional distress
71-1_3582.46_20.82.wav_ASR	and i mean the the maybe untold stories that work in the real close friends are just good
71-1_3604.84_2.74.wav_ASR	so that's why i ended up doing
71-1_3608.2_4.664.wav_ASR	and but it was so interesting to me as that i worked just hard
71-1_3613.32_4.157.wav_ASR	and i use the same sort of you know
71-1_3618.84_5.61.wav_ASR	you hafta sort a rehabilitation list that you're in the middle of doing
71-1_3624.45_1.994.wav_ASR	well other you're going to the bar to drink
71-1_3626.65_1.508.wav_ASR	you're going here to get your food
71-1_3628.39_1.405.wav_ASR	you're gonna go to school more war
71-1_3630.11_0.946.wav_ASR	you're gonna give me your check
71-1_3631.51_5.578.wav_ASR	you hafta keep them all kind of revolving all the time
71-1_3637.31_4.757.wav_ASR	trying to decide exactly how you're going to paris each of those tasks
71-1_3642.067_10.0.wav_ASR	it's really i mean being aware of being aware of it
71-1_3653.687_3.66.wav_ASR	it's just bare that they don't pay people any money to do that
71-1_3657.49_4.33.wav_ASR	but i was lucky because i made a number of money that i was still able to graduate
71-1_3662.01_8.22.wav_ASR	and i wasn't paying the deed of the amount money that grds are paid now which is out
71-1_3672.05_0.61.wav_ASR	what's her name
71-1_3673.93_2.38.wav_ASR	so yes for my university
71-1_3676.61_1.701.wav_ASR	that was very different
71-1_3678.311_5.3.wav_ASR	but yeah i had no students because i worked as a waitress in restaurants
71-1_3698.06_0.59.wav_ASR	you know you
71-1_3699.03_2.999.wav_ASR	and it's really mentally kind of like
71-1_3703.14_1.235.wav_ASR	you got you know three minutes
71-1_3704.68_0.709.wav_ASR	and i can go back
71-1_3705.62_0.591.wav_ASR	and i'll go to school
71-1_3706.54_0.366.wav_ASR	you know
71-1_3707.62_2.536.wav_ASR	it's sort of like it's kind of a challenge
71-1_3710.2_0.816.wav_ASR	it's kind of fun
71-1_3713.34_0.455.wav_ASR	yeah
71-1_3718.76_0.845.wav_ASR	and you're gonna say
71-1_3719.76_0.59.wav_ASR	and they needed water
71-1_3720.7_1.28.wav_ASR	and you need more coffee over there
71-1_3722.26_0.96.wav_ASR	you got this going on
71-1_3723.52_4.32.wav_ASR	and i will say that the second place i worked at tried to try
71-1_3728.62_8.414.wav_ASR	and when i went to get a physical they were trying to figure out why this muscle on this arm was stronger than this one
71-1_3738.16_0.74.wav_ASR	there's something going on
71-1_3739.09_0.75.wav_ASR	here's a girl
71-1_3739.97_0.49.wav_ASR	and i said
71-1_3740.68_1.82.wav_ASR	and i'm just really sorry
71-1_3743.1_1.92.wav_ASR	yes yes
71-1_3753.971_14.825.wav_ASR	well if i were going to make peanut butter and jelly sandwich i would begin by pulling out the bread
71-1_3769.311_2.802.wav_ASR	and taking out two slices of bread
71-1_3772.113_2.019.wav_ASR	and and laying them on the table
71-1_3774.633_8.24.wav_ASR	and i would go and get the jar of jelly and the jar peanut butter
71-1_3783.713_4.173.wav_ASR	and i would bring probably a spoon and a knife with me
71-1_3788.57_2.863.wav_ASR	and i would begin with the peanut butter peanut butter
71-1_3792.068_2.272.wav_ASR	it's really difficult to say it
71-1_3794.488_0.84.wav_ASR	peanut butter
71-1_3796.268_4.045.wav_ASR	and i would spread that on one side of the bread
71-1_3800.828_3.96.wav_ASR	the other piece of bread i would put on
71-1_3805.108_1.06.wav_ASR	we'll use a spoon
71-1_3806.568_1.011.wav_ASR	and i would pull out the jar
71-1_3807.92_4.373.wav_ASR	and i would spread that evenly on that piece of bread
71-1_3812.7_2.72.wav_ASR	then i would close the two of them together
71-1_3816.12_6.32.wav_ASR	we would close the tops back on the jelly and the peanut butter
71-1_3822.66_0.63.wav_ASR	put them away
71-1_3823.88_1.4.wav_ASR	and then i would eat my sandwich
71-1_3832.11_5.6.wav_ASR	well i don't do it often
71-1_3838.45_1.708.wav_ASR	you know not a lot of things i should
71-1_3840.85_15.069.wav_ASR	when i do my laundry decide the fact that i do have washing machine downstairs i tend to go to the one laundry mat because i can do all of it at one time
71-1_3856.37_2.654.wav_ASR	and i only wanna do it once a week or every other week
71-1_3859.024_4.476.wav_ASR	because it's just something i find kind of boring to do
71-1_3863.904_3.04.wav_ASR	what what i do is
71-1_3868.044_1.74.wav_ASR	well first i hafta do this to mom
71-1_3870.184_1.23.wav_ASR	so let me think about this
71-1_3871.644_3.54.wav_ASR	and all of my daughters
71-1_3875.33_5.584.wav_ASR	and i usually use the cell test to find out whether they go into the hospital or not
71-1_3880.914_18.7.wav_ASR	when i decide that everything needs to be washed with all the towels handcloths and the other towels handcloths that are hanging in the kitchen i would all of them in
71-1_3900.01_5.52.wav_ASR	it was a cinderella's laundromat
71-1_3907.24_0.66.wav_ASR	and i would put them
71-1_3908.31_4.39.wav_ASR	we would carry it to the back side of my back of my back
71-1_3913.6_8.52.wav_ASR	well i would make sure that i could use for the currency in the laundry room
71-1_3923.11_1.57.wav_ASR	and i would go to the laundry room
71-1_3924.88_6.327.wav_ASR	we would find the largest member that was able to do all of my hair at one time in one minute
71-1_3931.207_5.18.wav_ASR	and i would put the laundry in
71-1_3937.23_12.357.wav_ASR	if they didn't all fit at the clothing that could be washed at a higher lower temperature washing machine
71-1_3950.36_1.814.wav_ASR	make sure the soap was in
71-1_3952.46_2.068.wav_ASR	oh i would make sure i had enough care
71-1_3955.36_6.792.wav_ASR	and then i would probably go by foot or something there being washed
71-1_3962.36_0.924.wav_ASR	come back
71-1_3963.54_1.44.wav_ASR	they're in the drive
71-1_3965.86_2.403.wav_ASR	well i don't really feel them the way i'm supposed to
71-1_3968.54_0.71.wav_ASR	well i just thought
71-1_3969.66_4.29.wav_ASR	well and then put them away kind of as i use them when i
71-1_3985.92_4.75.wav_ASR	you mean what would i choose to wear or
71-1_3995.3_0.57.wav_ASR	oh i said
71-1_3996.39_11.38.wav_ASR	well the first thing i would do every morning is start my coffee because that really is gonna happen before i make decisions about what math is what
71-1_4008.33_2.38.wav_ASR	oh i was part of the
71-1_4011.9_2.75.wav_ASR	and i usually do the four over over
71-1_4015.51_1.41.wav_ASR	and i really thought
71-1_4017.61_2.19.wav_ASR	so i usually would grind the coffee
71-1_4020.33_1.78.wav_ASR	started the the water
71-1_4023.83_2.36.wav_ASR	and i would go into my bed
71-1_4026.63_3.12.wav_ASR	and generally i have some idea what i'm gonna do
71-1_4030.63_3.28.wav_ASR	and if only because i hafta dig stuff up sometimes
71-1_4033.91_1.26.wav_ASR	and i don't wanna have any
71-1_4035.602_4.45.wav_ASR	well i don't really have time to look a lot in the morning
71-1_4040.49_2.54.wav_ASR	so i'm gonna be aware of what i'm gonna wear all the time
71-1_4043.51_5.14.wav_ASR	so i usually start well clearly understand
71-1_4049.59_3.481.wav_ASR	and then whatever cost or cost i'm worried
71-1_4053.071_3.66.wav_ASR	and at that point it the water's usually ready
71-1_4057.231_2.079.wav_ASR	so yeah i got my lines clear
71-1_4059.631_10.319.wav_ASR	well i'm running around here half dressed and then figuring out what kind of shirt i'm gonna wear whether and then trying to make decisions about how cold it is
71-1_4070.191_1.359.wav_ASR	so i need a wheelchair
71-1_4071.75_1.32.wav_ASR	do i need to write one
71-1_4073.07_2.819.wav_ASR	and while the cops are making
71-1_4076.37_2.828.wav_ASR	but the time the cops made me go on my bedclothes on
71-1_4079.87_6.666.wav_ASR	and i take the coffee with me in the bathroom when i make decisions about insurance and all that other stuff
71-1_4086.94_4.822.wav_ASR	but you know the basics all i have to worry about it
71-1_4091.79_5.715.wav_ASR	and if i'm irritated and don't know how i'm doing i'm tired and don't know what i'm doing
71-1_4098.11_1.432.wav_ASR	so i have a lot of black clothes
71-1_4100.07_0.77.wav_ASR	well there's that
71-2_14.77_15.16.wav_ASR	well i think my favorite part about where i live and i live on the near east side of massachusetts is that i'm close to the lake
71-2_30.89_1.34.wav_ASR	well firstnamem is cisco
71-2_32.41_2.38.wav_ASR	we we have four different languages that are here
71-2_35.21_8.54.wav_ASR	and the firstnamem actually comes from a word that actually speaks for law
71-2_44.69_5.4.wav_ASR	so a block away from where i live is lake
71-2_50.725_3.302.wav_ASR	and it's the biggest of the lakes
71-2_54.665_6.7.wav_ASR	and what i like the most about it is a bike path to my
71-2_62.83_6.42.wav_ASR	the lake is to my left with a running path that goes along it
71-2_70.27_7.38.wav_ASR	and i literally can get pretty much everywhere that i need to go in the city of miami
71-2_79.43_1.82.wav_ASR	and i'm very close to the lake
71-2_82.17_4.02.wav_ASR	so one of the things i do when i run
71-2_86.95_2.98.wav_ASR	well now i would pretty much call it fast walking
71-2_90.071_3.86.wav_ASR	and not not not my
71-2_94.531_6.34.wav_ASR	in my prime i would run about seven miles a month earlier
71-2_100.931_2.26.wav_ASR	and i would go get it down about seven minutes
71-2_103.351_3.4.wav_ASR	well i'm pretty much just walking and
71-2_107.621_3.7.wav_ASR	and we're more like eleven minutes miles
71-2_111.741_2.56.wav_ASR	you know but i usually get about five and every morning
71-2_114.621_7.309.wav_ASR	it's it's kind of medical in the sense that you can look at the water
71-2_122.181_1.029.wav_ASR	you can see the bird
71-2_123.87_10.3.wav_ASR	it's just much more difficult than it would be to be in a tree
71-2_134.77_3.32.wav_ASR	so that's one of the things i really like about where i live
71-2_139.91_1.36.wav_ASR	turn
71-2_142.244_0.5.wav_ASR	oh
71-2_144.217_0.467.wav_ASR	oh oh
71-2_144.93_1.073.wav_ASR	well i don't think that i'm
71-2_146.764_2.154.wav_ASR	well not sure that's the right word that i mean
71-2_149.284_0.5.wav_ASR	and i mean
71-2_153.748_0.593.wav_ASR	what is it
71-2_155.384_1.306.wav_ASR	oh i just see the word
71-2_156.884_0.526.wav_ASR	well i kept saying
71-2_157.764_1.566.wav_ASR	well i'm screwing that word i guess
71-2_159.584_0.92.wav_ASR	well no i wasn't
71-2_160.706_2.562.wav_ASR	well i hear a word that i already know
71-2_163.426_0.544.wav_ASR	and i keep saying
71-2_164.206_1.044.wav_ASR	that's what i'm saying that wrong
71-2_165.746_4.624.wav_ASR	but i i just hafta be reunited with words that i actually already know
71-2_171.106_0.564.wav_ASR	oh yes
71-2_173.086_3.54.wav_ASR	well long ago much better than being on a treadmill
71-2_177.146_2.769.wav_ASR	and i the block away which is why like living here
71-2_179.915_0.5.wav_ASR	yeah
71-2_200.31_2.58.wav_ASR	again my speech is not reliable
71-2_204.23_8.987.wav_ASR	but the most part when i speak i know what i'm going to say
71-2_213.77_16.481.wav_ASR	but if i try to say something that's more complicated something in my world or become more realistic my words don't come out the way i like to say them
71-2_230.251_8.589.wav_ASR	or the words are in my brain but i'm not quite able to articulate them the way that i want to
71-2_238.97_3.38.wav_ASR	generally i know right away when i'm in the state
71-2_243.091_1.339.wav_ASR	but sometimes i don't
71-2_244.631_2.0.wav_ASR	yes dearie i i said to someone
71-2_246.696_3.48.wav_ASR	and well we got this election coming up in january first
71-2_250.676_1.27.wav_ASR	and she said
71-2_253.536_0.404.wav_ASR	why for
71-2_253.94_0.621.wav_ASR	that's abck
71-2_254.576_0.84.wav_ASR	and i said
71-2_255.492_0.747.wav_ASR	what did i say
71-2_256.376_0.528.wav_ASR	and she said
71-2_256.996_0.815.wav_ASR	you said firstnamej
71-2_258.98_1.021.wav_ASR	well it feels like janu
71-2_260.696_3.525.wav_ASR	and again i try to just wind those and figure out how to get past it
71-2_264.41_8.22.wav_ASR	but i simply cannot trust that what will come out of my mouth is what i'm actually trying to say
71-2_273.01_14.82.wav_ASR	and i don't know how to fix that except just to keep trying to recover those language pals that have been depressed and try to catch them fast
71-2_295.73_2.62.wav_ASR	yes i remember exactly when i had a stroke
71-2_298.52_5.42.wav_ASR	well i had a stroke on january first twenty twenty one
71-2_320.33_14.302.wav_ASR	so i certainly had baltimore head firstnamel and did not know what it was for two days
71-2_335.13_1.573.wav_ASR	and then of course they admitted me
71-2_336.703_9.4.wav_ASR	but it was past the window to be able to give me some type of drugs that might help up the clot
71-2_347.563_2.227.wav_ASR	so i answered the hospital
71-2_350.403_1.92.wav_ASR	they assume i would have another stroke
71-2_353.183_0.607.wav_ASR	and i have not
71-2_354.09_4.36.wav_ASR	and they have not been able to find the causes of the illness
71-2_359.72_1.67.wav_ASR	and i suppose it was the perfect stroke
71-2_362.04_12.44.wav_ASR	and i assume it might have been a conversation working out really hard because of the pandemic and not being able to have christmas
71-2_374.76_2.765.wav_ASR	those were pre christmas day
71-2_378.52_3.0.wav_ASR	we were in a position then where it was pretty easy
71-2_381.743_3.632.wav_ASR	and and i don't know what else it could be
71-2_385.583_5.67.wav_ASR	literally there's there's physical nothing wrong with my body
71-2_391.703_3.994.wav_ASR	and all of my numbers indicate that i should not have a stroke
71-2_395.843_2.223.wav_ASR	and yes i had a stroke
71-2_398.363_1.62.wav_ASR	so yeah and
71-2_400.181_2.92.wav_ASR	peanut butter and jelly
71-2_403.981_4.263.wav_ASR	which at some point i i just moved on from that i guess
71-2_408.721_0.379.wav_ASR	yeah
71-2_418.32_17.68.wav_ASR	well last i said a week ago most of the recovery has been physical or healthcare or help from many medical professionals
71-2_437.57_8.66.wav_ASR	and i think that's kind of a travesty in the sense that people have that
71-2_446.73_3.68.wav_ASR	and i was careless as having a medical stroke
71-2_451.57_12.92.wav_ASR	we're in the position of the personnel to come to communicate if we're given the right information with certain times
71-2_464.99_16.04.wav_ASR	so i think the first six months after stroke is really cruel in terms of rehabilitation because you're blind is bad luck to bring back language recovery
71-2_482.13_11.14.wav_ASR	well i'm really disappointed in the american health insurance insurance that i was not given what i should have thought
71-2_493.53_18.08.wav_ASR	so what i've done on my own is really impressive my my my oldest firstnamem firstnamec married firstnamem firstnamec
71-2_511.89_1.417.wav_ASR	well i've already understood that
71-2_513.307_1.654.wav_ASR	and i've been doing that for about ten years
71-2_515.327_10.103.wav_ASR	and i gave up drinking completely though i don't really think that was a huge one last summer
71-2_525.43_10.02.wav_ASR	but it might introduce firstnamem
71-2_536.21_4.1.wav_ASR	it might increase inflammation in my body
71-2_540.325_10.3.wav_ASR	and that something that i'm trying to work very strong to make sure that i have an injury impairment
71-2_551.465_1.7.wav_ASR	and i've improved my exercise
71-2_553.585_1.6.wav_ASR	again i'm already i
71-2_559.81_19.778.wav_ASR	and i've experienced the cognitive of the very complex cognitive tests that i do every single day to make sure that my focus and concentration levels are really high
71-2_579.588_2.895.wav_ASR	and again i was a firstnamem
71-2_582.748_15.385.wav_ASR	so i have already done a lot of research every day doing a lot of close work every day trying to develop and we've arranged together every single day
71-2_598.133_2.617.wav_ASR	and i've done it much more conscious than in the past
71-2_601.85_7.16.wav_ASR	reading is always reliable in the sense that i have the option of alphabet
71-2_609.473_2.297.wav_ASR	and i do sometimes use the wrong word
71-2_612.753_2.617.wav_ASR	and i remember caught it when i at it
71-2_615.79_3.34.wav_ASR	and i always hadta attend it before the stroke too
71-2_619.37_9.39.wav_ASR	so i don't know to what extent those mistakes are correct or whether that's just the way that right
71-2_628.91_4.36.wav_ASR	and sometimes you do a rough draft to get the ideas out
71-2_633.443_2.915.wav_ASR	and then you remember it the second time around
71-2_637.303_9.727.wav_ASR	so i i think the only difference from the stroke until the stroke and before is making sure i always get up
71-2_647.963_4.187.wav_ASR	before the stroke i tried to get sleep
71-2_652.45_7.12.wav_ASR	but if i didn't power on because i have a cellphone that i hafta
71-2_660.87_8.901.wav_ASR	now it's a priority for me to make sure that i speak as much as i can
71-2_670.05_5.06.wav_ASR	but at that i just have a reason every single day that i always done
71-2_676.49_0.563.wav_ASR	really well
71-2_677.41_1.165.wav_ASR	exactly every day
71-2_679.05_2.72.wav_ASR	push my brain as much as i can
71-2_682.23_7.28.wav_ASR	they made a tent to take back up a language skills
71-2_689.79_3.4.wav_ASR	it was taking semesters before the stroke
71-2_693.397_2.653.wav_ASR	when i was in high school when i was in high school
71-2_696.33_3.6.wav_ASR	and i picked up a little bit of denise when i lived in korea
71-2_701.01_4.263.wav_ASR	but i thought spanish would be much more useful than french
71-2_706.37_2.1.wav_ASR	so i started taking a spanish class
71-2_708.69_4.73.wav_ASR	and i hadta decide it because it was late at night
71-2_713.57_1.99.wav_ASR	it just really wasn't working out for me
71-2_716.7_10.19.wav_ASR	but from what i remember recently i think one of the things that might be really helpful to realize my english is to pick up spanish
71-2_727.56_1.88.wav_ASR	you know i don't
71-2_729.6_1.14.wav_ASR	that thought it might be confusing
71-2_731.12_2.971.wav_ASR	but well not try it you know
71-2_734.091_1.949.wav_ASR	why not is what happened
71-2_736.54_3.066.wav_ASR	so yeah that may be what i do next i think
71-2_739.76_1.333.wav_ASR	what i'm already doing
71-2_767.08_3.158.wav_ASR	what do you see
71-2_771.54_4.68.wav_ASR	happy sad
71-2_779.25_0.7.wav_ASR	oh
71-2_782.83_5.9.wav_ASR	and i'm gonna talk about my rationing what happened on nine eleven and two thousand and two thousand and two thousand and one
71-2_790.19_2.46.wav_ASR	and i was tired
71-2_793.11_3.98.wav_ASR	was the beginning of the the spring semester in two thousand and two
71-2_797.09_4.16.wav_ASR	and and my daughter had gone to school
71-2_803.03_9.82.wav_ASR	so as soon she left at at about eight five i turned on the computer because i hadta finish myself
71-2_813.15_3.66.wav_ASR	yes i i should have already finished my son
71-2_817.67_1.9.wav_ASR	and it was generally done
71-2_819.73_2.089.wav_ASR	but i was kind of playing with somebody else
71-2_822.23_5.923.wav_ASR	oh on my epcol polynesian palace because i just wanted to just adopted a little bit
71-2_828.41_1.08.wav_ASR	so i wasn't alone
71-2_830.33_2.92.wav_ASR	obviously the radar was not because i had to consult
71-2_833.352_4.423.wav_ASR	or i certainly wasn't much troubled when i was trying to do my work
71-2_837.872_12.614.wav_ASR	so i was in this zone of civilization and sinai which won't ever just going through these different art collectors and dinosaurs which one was trying to do
71-2_851.51_5.54.wav_ASR	and at two o'clock in the afternoon i was gonna take a break
71-2_857.21_3.32.wav_ASR	and i was gonna go to my gym and work out
71-2_861.07_1.14.wav_ASR	and it was a beautiful day
71-2_862.61_1.64.wav_ASR	well cinderella
71-2_868.85_0.8.wav_ASR	and i turned on the radio
71-2_870.87_3.98.wav_ASR	and the announcer said
71-2_875.69_2.16.wav_ASR	don't really know if the schools are gonna close
71-2_878.53_0.64.wav_ASR	and i kept saying
71-2_879.77_1.12.wav_ASR	the school is gonna close
71-2_881.09_0.48.wav_ASR	what's the word
71-2_888.143_3.145.wav_ASR	and and i got to the the jam
71-2_892.33_2.473.wav_ASR	and there were colours every day
71-2_895.423_2.206.wav_ASR	they were in the desk when you come in
71-2_897.723_1.36.wav_ASR	and that never ever
71-2_899.443_1.827.wav_ASR	everybody looked really upset
71-2_901.963_1.96.wav_ASR	so i i'm walking in there saying
71-2_904.483_2.874.wav_ASR	thinking happy that i don't know about
71-2_907.37_1.5.wav_ASR	but everybody knows about it
71-2_909.35_2.12.wav_ASR	they're all staring at at the screen
71-2_911.55_3.34.wav_ASR	so i went to the second one where my tread
71-2_915.83_3.818.wav_ASR	and again the trills were not any way near us running along the lake
71-2_919.77_3.262.wav_ASR	but that's what i was gonna do that day because i hadta do some lip stuff
71-2_923.27_1.915.wav_ASR	and that's when i saw it
71-2_925.185_12.8.wav_ASR	at that point by two o'clock they were just reeling it over and over and around the two planes that were hitting the the window doors inside
71-2_938.265_2.813.wav_ASR	and they were introducing people who are trying to get away
71-2_941.365_1.64.wav_ASR	and everything is covered with ashes
71-2_944.49_6.22.wav_ASR	and i remember getting on the treadmill and listening to music and you know putting on my headphones and listening to it
71-2_951.07_7.56.wav_ASR	and i just kept going fast and fast and fast because the ambulance of what happened was just so shocked
71-2_959.41_3.86.wav_ASR	so i kinda use that you know to exercise my work
71-2_963.53_2.82.wav_ASR	and i got out of there
71-2_966.61_1.02.wav_ASR	and i went home and said
71-2_967.91_0.384.wav_ASR	you mean
71-2_968.294_4.966.wav_ASR	well i got a really close friend that lives in denise that works near the pennsylvania
71-2_973.35_2.086.wav_ASR	and so is he alone
71-2_975.69_0.829.wav_ASR	what's going on
71-2_977.21_0.94.wav_ASR	so i tried to call
71-2_978.45_3.78.wav_ASR	well of course i couldn't get through because all the singers were were dead
71-2_982.23_3.06.wav_ASR	now no one could get home and dessert
71-2_985.57_1.836.wav_ASR	everything was shot down
71-2_988.71_2.16.wav_ASR	and i got on one
71-2_991.09_0.94.wav_ASR	and i started email
71-2_992.31_1.48.wav_ASR	and then i emailed my doctor
71-2_993.97_1.78.wav_ASR	it was in the political science department
71-2_995.93_0.34.wav_ASR	and cinderella said
71-2_996.81_2.067.wav_ASR	we're gonna have a couple on campus
71-2_999.41_1.76.wav_ASR	we're gonna invite the community
71-2_1001.32_2.481.wav_ASR	and we're going to explain what is going on
71-2_1004.36_5.934.wav_ASR	and we're gonna explain all of them
71-2_1010.3_3.871.wav_ASR	we're gonna explain the aphasia of it
71-2_1014.18_3.5.wav_ASR	we're gonna talk about the history of
71-2_1018.48_2.588.wav_ASR	we're gonna explain exactly what's going on here
71-2_1021.068_3.442.wav_ASR	and everybody got back to me and me
71-2_1024.788_2.32.wav_ASR	you mean they everyone responded to it
71-2_1027.288_1.502.wav_ASR	and i'd be happy to talk about this
71-2_1029.048_5.302.wav_ASR	and i'll be happy to talk about the questions in arizona
71-2_1034.35_7.22.wav_ASR	and maybe that's related to what's going on with the the the bums that are
71-2_1041.762_18.784.wav_ASR	all we know at that point that they were coming from philadelphia and the colorado and the western state and the world trade center is
71-2_1060.546_2.0.wav_ASR	and how it is that we're gonna be or
71-2_1063.386_1.58.wav_ASR	they were amazed with us
71-2_1066.026_2.694.wav_ASR	oh yeah it all came together really cool
71-2_1069.006_1.514.wav_ASR	we went to bed at one o'clock in the morning
71-2_1071.126_4.007.wav_ASR	finally got a email back from firstnamee who was fine
71-2_1075.986_3.141.wav_ASR	and got up to campus the next day
71-2_1079.127_3.12.wav_ASR	and all the lessons were just crashed
71-2_1082.467_8.34.wav_ASR	and all we did is talk about what happened in every single class hour after hours after hours
71-2_1091.927_2.073.wav_ASR	oh right now that's that's a lot better
71-2_1094.327_0.6.wav_ASR	yeah
71-2_1095.507_3.195.wav_ASR	it was a great palindrome by the way
71-2_1098.702_2.177.wav_ASR	we think we had five hundred people
71-2_1101.002_4.48.wav_ASR	it's standing long standing standing
71-2_1106.562_0.607.wav_ASR	my turn to say
71-2_1107.262_1.0.wav_ASR	he's standing
71-2_1108.642_3.021.wav_ASR	people hadta stand in the back
71-2_1111.942_1.56.wav_ASR	what what i'm trying to say is sound
71-2_1115.89_2.82.wav_ASR	and i'll always freeze that i useta be able to say
71-2_1118.87_0.92.wav_ASR	and i start to say
71-2_1119.99_1.393.wav_ASR	and i forget with the other in the middle
71-2_1122.11_1.8.wav_ASR	standing room alone
71-2_1124.33_0.389.wav_ASR	yeah we
71-2_1124.719_2.671.wav_ASR	fill up the place bicycle when i was a young child
71-2_1127.69_1.1.wav_ASR	and everybody's question
71-2_1129.59_0.76.wav_ASR	how do they help us
71-2_1130.57_2.4.wav_ASR	and that's what we became with
71-2_1133.59_0.94.wav_ASR	oh oh okay
71-2_1136.424_12.445.wav_ASR	other than i missed the whole thing because of course i was on line right around where we were
71-2_1189.34_19.84.wav_ASR	well this seems to be taken place in naborhood because the homes are relatively close to each other
71-2_1209.06_5.336.wav_ASR	and it looks like what's going on is a boy is in the backyard
71-2_1214.88_2.2.wav_ASR	and he's playing with his soccer
71-2_1217.52_1.92.wav_ASR	he's practicing his car
71-2_1220.38_11.126.wav_ASR	and unfortunately this time the ball doesn't go where he hoped it would go and crashes into the window
71-2_1232.06_5.1.wav_ASR	and it looks like it might have been the window of his next door neighbor
71-2_1237.38_1.26.wav_ASR	it couldn't be his father
71-2_1238.86_0.86.wav_ASR	it's difficult to know
71-2_1239.78_7.2.wav_ASR	well but it was next to the yard in which was next to his soccer ball
71-2_1247.88_3.96.wav_ASR	well it hit the the glass of the window and broke it
71-2_1252.48_4.08.wav_ASR	and unfortunately there was a man that was sitting in the chair right next to the window
71-2_1257.78_7.66.wav_ASR	and the soccer ball not only broke the window but went through the house
71-2_1266.32_2.88.wav_ASR	well apparently they have no screams from what i'm guess
71-2_1269.48_2.687.wav_ASR	so it can't be because we have medicals here
71-2_1272.167_11.407.wav_ASR	and in any case the ball ended up in the house in the home directly where the man was sitting
71-2_1284.62_3.27.wav_ASR	and he was not pleased about this
71-2_1288.15_5.76.wav_ASR	he stood up and looked out the window to try to figure out who had broken the window
71-2_1294.2_1.43.wav_ASR	well where did the ball come from
71-2_1295.93_9.0.wav_ASR	and who is the person who had reached that ball tore his window
71-2_1305.71_7.06.wav_ASR	he's clearly that there's going to be some kind of rehabilitation as a result of this
71-2_1313.51_3.88.wav_ASR	because if it's his son his son is going to school
71-2_1317.638_12.22.wav_ASR	and if it's a newspaper and probably some sort of palindrome and probably some sort of palindrome that's been broken
71-2_1331.61_2.368.wav_ASR	so firstnamer and the surgeon
71-2_1351.36_23.18.wav_ASR	well we're gonna tell older children this story mother knows best with the name of firstnamep which was called firstnamedp or sixth
71-2_1374.637_1.24.wav_ASR	and it was very painful
71-2_1376.717_2.203.wav_ASR	you know the father's
71-2_1379.217_1.12.wav_ASR	mother is the housewife
71-2_1380.877_2.16.wav_ASR	the father knows best
71-2_1383.339_19.92.wav_ASR	and in any case this particular story is gonna be mother knows best with their children
71-2_1403.327_4.073.wav_ASR	but not always but in this particular case that's unfortunate
71-2_1407.4_17.237.wav_ASR	and and what's going on is this child and the child's mother is demanding over a umbrella with him when he leaves
71-2_1424.637_5.175.wav_ASR	and the mother is saying because they're getting ready for the boy to go off on his own
71-2_1430.477_1.44.wav_ASR	and the mother is saying
71-2_1432.357_10.134.wav_ASR	it's on what we see with the clothes that are outside of it looks like it's gonna rain
71-2_1442.577_1.295.wav_ASR	well i think you should take an umbrella
71-2_1443.872_2.02.wav_ASR	and the little boy is going like
71-2_1446.272_1.58.wav_ASR	you're not taking an umbrella
71-2_1448.132_1.546.wav_ASR	and i don't need one
71-2_1450.032_1.204.wav_ASR	and i don't care if it rains
71-2_1451.572_0.969.wav_ASR	and not gonna mess
71-2_1453.572_2.904.wav_ASR	and i'm fine on my own
71-2_1457.132_0.708.wav_ASR	so she said
71-2_1458.152_1.904.wav_ASR	well alright you know best
71-2_1460.812_1.116.wav_ASR	and she says goodbye to him
71-2_1462.212_0.403.wav_ASR	you know what you're saying
71-2_1462.615_2.1.wav_ASR	if she's still holding the umbrella
71-2_1465.335_0.768.wav_ASR	he helps out
71-2_1466.655_2.06.wav_ASR	and it's not just a sprinkle
71-2_1468.935_3.82.wav_ASR	but it really starts to rain really hard
71-2_1472.915_1.22.wav_ASR	it's a downpour
71-2_1475.7_2.625.wav_ASR	and he doesn't have a hat
71-2_1478.655_2.945.wav_ASR	so the rain is getting inside
71-2_1481.94_2.26.wav_ASR	and he's getting really really wet
71-2_1484.32_4.93.wav_ASR	his clothes are getting dressed and saturday saturday with the water
71-2_1489.82_1.78.wav_ASR	so he gets about hemoglobin
71-2_1492.22_1.78.wav_ASR	and he can't even see it is going off
71-2_1494.3_3.58.wav_ASR	so he hits back to his mother very
71-2_1499.24_0.76.wav_ASR	he looks at them
71-2_1501.22_2.46.wav_ASR	and she has the glass not to say
71-2_1503.88_0.744.wav_ASR	well i told you so
71-2_1505.06_1.279.wav_ASR	because mother knows best
71-2_1506.48_1.32.wav_ASR	they knew the word
71-2_1508.74_1.78.wav_ASR	and he stands her and looks at her
71-2_1510.86_1.98.wav_ASR	and she ends up the umbrella
71-2_1513.76_0.96.wav_ASR	and he had a job again
71-2_1515.14_3.02.wav_ASR	and this time remember in his brain
71-2_1519.26_3.04.wav_ASR	my mother's not always wrong about everything
71-2_1524.14_4.02.wav_ASR	and of course he forgets by the next week when somebody comes up
71-2_1528.48_7.687.wav_ASR	where we are in this week he is now assured that his mother actually has wisdom which he doesn't yet have
71-2_1536.5_2.081.wav_ASR	my mother's name firstnamesb
71-2_1555.22_3.121.wav_ASR	well speaking of firstnamej in the newspaper
71-2_1559.54_8.9.wav_ASR	what had happened here because the cat was sitting on the porch
71-2_1569.36_3.67.wav_ASR	and the cat has the right to sit on the branch
71-2_1573.78_3.17.wav_ASR	but the next door neighbor has a dog
71-2_1576.95_6.958.wav_ASR	and the dog came out and immediately saw the cat and ran over and started barking at the cat
71-2_1584.11_1.22.wav_ASR	and the cat was stuck
71-2_1586.07_5.36.wav_ASR	well the cat ran from the dog and ran up the tree because that was close
71-2_1591.15_6.0.wav_ASR	and that was a way to get away from the dog because the dog couldn't climb
71-2_1597.65_2.042.wav_ASR	so the cat climbed up the tree
71-2_1600.41_0.894.wav_ASR	what do you call the young kid
71-2_1601.49_6.55.wav_ASR	it's a cat that just barely a kitten and isn't really a costume to be that high up
71-2_1608.43_1.61.wav_ASR	so the cat crawled up
71-2_1610.78_6.66.wav_ASR	the little girl ran out saw her cat was up in the tree and called her father and said
71-2_1619.16_1.18.wav_ASR	cat is up in the tree
71-2_1621.04_3.96.wav_ASR	and she's out on the far
71-2_1625.76_9.82.wav_ASR	and it doesn't look like she's finding her way to get back out because she's alone and clearly wants to be rescued
71-2_1636.4_1.22.wav_ASR	so please help me
71-2_1638.16_2.86.wav_ASR	please help me get my cat out of the tree
71-2_1641.3_3.6.wav_ASR	well the father's trying to be cheerful and the cinderella
71-2_1645.16_4.36.wav_ASR	so he immediately goes into the grass and finds his ladder and finds his ladder
71-2_1650.2_21.487.wav_ASR	and the palm for him was he would simply be able to climb his way up to the limb where the cat was grabbed probably put it inside his shirt
71-2_1671.68_2.39.wav_ASR	and then he could be you know the hero
71-2_1674.76_5.62.wav_ASR	he could fall his father's rescue
71-2_1681.42_2.26.wav_ASR	and unfortunately he got up in the tree
71-2_1684.54_10.49.wav_ASR	and the cinderella rescued the ladder against the tree in the way he really needed it
71-2_1695.33_1.1.wav_ASR	and it fell
71-2_1697.33_4.1.wav_ASR	so now we have two people that hafta be rescued from the tree
71-2_1701.65_7.1.wav_ASR	we have the cat that is still meowing loudly out in the far
71-2_1709.29_12.14.wav_ASR	and of course the father can't reach it because he's his way to move into these limbs without breaking them down
71-2_1721.65_1.78.wav_ASR	and then he would fall down and get her
71-2_1724.19_6.76.wav_ASR	so at this point the mother who knows best has called the fire department and said
71-2_1731.81_2.587.wav_ASR	we got a first stroke going on here
71-2_1734.59_1.211.wav_ASR	well that is what she said
71-2_1735.801_6.58.wav_ASR	but that's what she thought in her brain because she doesn't know about perfumes
71-2_1742.881_2.24.wav_ASR	can you please bring
71-2_1745.553_16.023.wav_ASR	unfortunately we now need help from fire firefighters to not only get the cat out to help rescue the cat
71-2_1761.576_6.523.wav_ASR	and my daughter is still having because she's worried about the cat
71-2_1768.376_1.494.wav_ASR	and now she's worried about her dad
71-2_1770.876_2.274.wav_ASR	and the dog is still barking
71-2_1773.756_3.1.wav_ASR	that's what she'd been doing is she's about ready to be done
71-2_1777.576_1.228.wav_ASR	is the fire firefighters are here
71-2_1779.076_1.061.wav_ASR	and they're coming over
71-2_1780.05_2.35.wav_ASR	and they're going to help the man get down first
71-2_1782.71_3.09.wav_ASR	and they're going to reach out and get the cat
71-2_1786.3_8.752.wav_ASR	and what the mother's gonna do is gonna go and grab the dog and put him in the other room so that everybody will relax a bit
71-2_1796.11_3.213.wav_ASR	and everybody can make it out of the tree without getting hurt
71-2_1799.323_1.586.wav_ASR	and he says
71-2_2004.09_16.38.wav_ASR	and what we're actually looking for here is american military and social military and what the current military in south america
71-2_2021.77_1.86.wav_ASR	so we're gonna start with that
71-2_2023.99_13.24.wav_ASR	and this is an example of the very recent rules that were applicable to women in certain cases
71-2_2038.46_5.74.wav_ASR	now what we're seeing here is a little bit clumsy
71-2_2045.26_10.16.wav_ASR	and the both cases what we had were two families with children
71-2_2056.56_3.02.wav_ASR	and each of them had a spouse that died
71-2_2061.01_13.758.wav_ASR	her husband had one daughter who was living with him
71-2_2075.16_1.256.wav_ASR	but his wife had died
71-2_2076.416_3.656.wav_ASR	so he had a young daughter who was about six years old
71-2_2080.296_11.24.wav_ASR	and firstnamer firstnamec will go back to what will say their own children
71-2_2091.936_1.731.wav_ASR	they hadta have a woman
71-2_2093.856_0.741.wav_ASR	it was her room
71-2_2094.68_3.78.wav_ASR	well people were relatively rigid in terms of what they were allowed to do
71-2_2099.12_3.78.wav_ASR	so he hadta find a wife and order to care for his daughter
71-2_2103.96_13.22.wav_ASR	and another part of town recently last summer we have a man and wife who had two children
71-2_2118.02_0.76.wav_ASR	and he died
71-2_2119.64_8.66.wav_ASR	so the only way that she would be able to survive as a female is to marry another man that would marry her
71-2_2129.4_2.86.wav_ASR	so they're both looking for another
71-2_2133.36_1.3.wav_ASR	and they meet each other
71-2_2135.0_28.16.wav_ASR	and of course what the husband is looking for the women or you know will take his father and you know will do all the other things that women are supposed to be in this society
71-2_2164.74_1.14.wav_ASR	so they meet each other
71-2_2166.5_3.74.wav_ASR	and he's got the impression that she's gonna be a wonderful wife
71-2_2170.64_3.8.wav_ASR	and she certainly grows all over his daughter
71-2_2175.66_1.62.wav_ASR	and so they married
71-2_2177.28_12.12.wav_ASR	they're now three children two daughters from her original family his daughter
71-2_2189.86_2.76.wav_ASR	and they've now blended into this new society
71-2_2193.69_11.26.wav_ASR	the father then follows his rule which is go out and makes money for the family and leaves the house under the assumption of the stepmother
71-2_2205.31_21.673.wav_ASR	the stepmother on the other hand if she's not afraid her parents her birth daughters and is going to treat other stepdaughters as if she's a maid
71-2_2227.87_6.94.wav_ASR	and for whatever reason the father doesn't notice when he sees when he is home
71-2_2235.41_10.02.wav_ASR	and so what we have is this really terrible situation that exercise for cinderella
71-2_2245.527_4.893.wav_ASR	well cinderella got a beautiful mother who loved her
71-2_2250.667_1.201.wav_ASR	and she was close to her father
71-2_2252.027_0.76.wav_ASR	and she lost her mom
71-2_2253.147_9.1.wav_ASR	now she's also in this situation where she's clearly treated differently than her stepdaughters stepdaughters
71-2_2262.887_2.555.wav_ASR	ten years ago
71-2_2265.442_1.074.wav_ASR	we happen all the time
71-2_2267.022_0.954.wav_ASR	and you know moving on
71-2_2269.122_1.278.wav_ASR	and they live in sinai
71-2_2270.462_8.32.wav_ASR	there's no way that women can improve their physical appearance except through marriage
71-2_2279.762_2.46.wav_ASR	is the only possible option to them
71-2_2282.222_18.073.wav_ASR	and so they're professional artists and also be attracted to the hollywoods and all of a sudden partners that are available to them
71-2_2300.295_2.36.wav_ASR	and i don't know what happens if they're not healthy
71-2_2303.295_2.211.wav_ASR	and i guess they just fake it
71-2_2305.815_2.972.wav_ASR	and in any case that's not part of this particular story
71-2_2309.455_1.22.wav_ASR	oh she's great
71-2_2310.915_3.032.wav_ASR	and so that's one complication she doesn't hafta deal with
71-2_2313.947_8.6.wav_ASR	and in any case on the other side of the city at a fire last year is
71-2_2323.465_20.82.wav_ASR	and again while the prince has also a lot of anxiety power and he's at the top of his college and also distracted to marry
71-2_2344.363_9.7.wav_ASR	because the plan is that he will marry a wife and that white will then bear him children
71-2_2354.443_6.44.wav_ASR	and those children then mean that will continue until the next december
71-2_2361.383_1.861.wav_ASR	so he may not wanna get married
71-2_2363.24_6.92.wav_ASR	and we don't really know what his firstnamee is or annette
71-2_2370.56_2.72.wav_ASR	but he understands what his job is
71-2_2373.42_1.38.wav_ASR	he hasta find a woman
71-2_2375.14_1.42.wav_ASR	he hasta find a part
71-2_2377.46_11.7.wav_ASR	and his plan is to find someone who's retired while he focuses on the recovery social structure of which they exercise
71-2_2389.76_4.76.wav_ASR	so the plan is he's gonna get this over with quick
71-2_2394.609_4.6.wav_ASR	just they're gonna have this huge dance this huge ball
71-2_2400.449_1.88.wav_ASR	and everyone in the kingdom
71-2_2403.749_2.623.wav_ASR	and i'm assuming we're pretty much middle class and above
71-2_2406.669_3.7.wav_ASR	he's not really going to the hospital class
71-2_2410.569_1.731.wav_ASR	it's not part of this at all
71-2_2413.36_14.64.wav_ASR	is involved all of the elementary females who are not married who will like to be married to him so that he can walk through and make his
71-2_2429.0_1.96.wav_ASR	and again this is clear
71-2_2432.56_5.54.wav_ASR	so last fall which i've never seen and never would see
71-2_2438.84_2.588.wav_ASR	but i certainly know aware of it
71-2_2441.428_16.26.wav_ASR	that that women are gonna be tested and grade out of other available women to be able to be married with
71-2_2458.96_11.18.wav_ASR	so anyway all three of these women the two step sisters and cinderella all know that they're illegal
71-2_2470.64_6.62.wav_ASR	and they'll start thinking about how wonderful their situation would be if they get
71-2_2477.759_2.965.wav_ASR	and and again it's not talking about love
71-2_2480.919_2.54.wav_ASR	well not talking about you know
71-2_2485.819_3.132.wav_ASR	we're not talking about people that are compatible with each other
71-2_2489.099_5.541.wav_ASR	we're talking about they will be attracted enough for this mail to choose them
71-2_2495.14_6.668.wav_ASR	and then there life situation will improve because those are the only obstacles that are available to them
71-2_2502.2_11.34.wav_ASR	and there's a very recent city in colorado which is very miserable for people with fibromyalgia
71-2_2514.72_1.813.wav_ASR	so they're all getting ready
71-2_2516.76_1.25.wav_ASR	and they know what they hafta do
71-2_2518.04_0.98.wav_ASR	they have a look
71-2_2519.46_1.52.wav_ASR	so they hafta have a really nice dress
71-2_2521.32_1.34.wav_ASR	and their hair is to be fixed up
71-2_2522.8_14.67.wav_ASR	and they hafta sometime make them stand out from the other ones and order to be enrolled in this degree college course that they're gonna be enrolled in
71-2_2538.05_7.3.wav_ASR	so because the stepmother favors her own daughters she pulls out whatever money they have available
71-2_2545.61_13.82.wav_ASR	and she gets them first dresses that you know with hairdressers dress up and they make up and everything else to get them hair done and everything else
71-2_2560.48_2.99.wav_ASR	ten o'clock pretty much she's on her own
71-2_2563.97_8.22.wav_ASR	so she gets out a book that she got from her mother which has puzzles
71-2_2572.57_8.51.wav_ASR	because she's very smart and very careful and because she knows how to do a lot of the email work in the house she knows how to say
71-2_2581.9_5.18.wav_ASR	so she pulls together some scraps of material that are available to her
71-2_2587.26_3.6.wav_ASR	and she puts together this really cool dress really
71-2_2591.12_1.64.wav_ASR	and you know it's kind of off the shoulder
71-2_2593.16_3.109.wav_ASR	and you know it's kind of pink which kind of plays off her hair
71-2_2597.18_1.602.wav_ASR	and she's ready to go
71-2_2599.24_1.68.wav_ASR	and she's doing the best that she can
71-2_2600.92_1.16.wav_ASR	and that's what she has a
71-2_2602.7_0.86.wav_ASR	and she's ready
71-2_2603.98_2.02.wav_ASR	and of course her mother said
71-2_2606.3_1.06.wav_ASR	our neurosurgeon
71-2_2609.46_2.94.wav_ASR	you are not of our story
71-2_2612.88_1.4.wav_ASR	you are a princess

71-2_2622.98_4.02.wav_ASR	and they the stepsisters of course have got their shoe from their mother
71-2_2627.22_1.94.wav_ASR	they know to be really real cool to her
71-2_2629.38_1.02.wav_ASR	so they left at her
71-2_2631.4_4.92.wav_ASR	and she goes out in the barn to take care of the animals because that kind of her refrigerator
71-2_2636.32_4.32.wav_ASR	that's the place where she can go and get some kind of affection from the other end
71-2_2641.04_0.764.wav_ASR	and she's out there
71-2_2642.1_1.3.wav_ASR	you know she's

71-2_2667.6_1.24.wav_ASR	and she dresses it

71-2_2821.17_8.52.wav_ASR	even her stepsisters don't know who this woman is because she dresses out
71-2_2830.55_10.16.wav_ASR	all the other people that are watching all they can think of is she must be from a really rich

71-2_2887.88_2.89.wav_ASR	and there's there's cinderella between
71-2_2891.62_0.875.wav_ASR	and he said
71-2_2893.18_1.008.wav_ASR	he's thinking at his mind
71-2_2894.42_1.321.wav_ASR	well i thought this was gonna be awful
71-2_2896.04_2.52.wav_ASR	and i thought this was gonna be a dirty a dirty
71-2_2898.78_2.795.wav_ASR	but i really like her
71-2_2902.0_1.34.wav_ASR	and this is this
71-2_2903.86_2.26.wav_ASR	it was helping for something this math
71-2_2906.281_1.956.wav_ASR	well i was prepared for something else
71-2_2908.461_1.931.wav_ASR	this just couldn't work
71-2_2910.761_2.955.wav_ASR	so he wants to spend time with her as much as he can
71-2_2913.941_0.479.wav_ASR	oh well firstnamesu
71-2_2914.681_0.98.wav_ASR	and she's in it too

71-2_2917.761_1.52.wav_ASR	it's just this wonderful bike
71-2_2920.001_4.289.wav_ASR	and then she looks up at the clock and sees that it's five minutes to midnight
71-2_2926.49_28.8.wav_ASR	and she knows that she realizes that she realizes firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnam
71-2_2956.938_4.418.wav_ASR	he she knows at that illusion will also be gone
71-2_2961.538_9.22.wav_ASR	you she's pretty sure that what he really wanted is all the stuff all the stuff they go along with wells
71-2_2971.438_5.015.wav_ASR	so she knows as soon as she realizes who she really is it's gonna be over
71-2_2976.453_4.78.wav_ASR	so she raises away as quick as she can because she wants to get away
71-2_2981.093_8.34.wav_ASR	when she doesn't see the look in his eye when he sees who her real is and how her real dress
71-2_2990.23_2.14.wav_ASR	so he doesn't understand what happened
71-2_2992.653_0.437.wav_ASR	here she goes
71-2_2993.173_0.717.wav_ASR	what did he say
71-2_2994.053_1.277.wav_ASR	did you say something to the firstnamer
71-2_2995.46_1.51.wav_ASR	or where she had it
71-2_2997.36_6.02.wav_ASR	and she races away as quickly as she can so quickly that she trips on her shoe
71-2_3003.6_0.62.wav_ASR	and she
71-2_3004.74_1.712.wav_ASR	and her shoe falls off
71-2_3006.6_1.342.wav_ASR	and she doesn't have time to grab it
71-2_3008.32_0.93.wav_ASR	and she's gotta go
71-2_3009.56_0.89.wav_ASR	and she's gonna get away
71-2_3010.96_1.49.wav_ASR	so she makes it around the corner
71-2_3012.45_3.64.wav_ASR	her and immediately it happened
71-2_3016.65_9.027.wav_ASR	the ball dress is transformed back into her rag
71-2_3025.677_7.746.wav_ASR	the pumpkin luckily she didn't get into it because i don't know what would have happened if she were actually inside the pumpkin
71-2_3033.917_1.461.wav_ASR	it's gone
71-2_3035.637_0.493.wav_ASR	it's a pumpkin
71-2_3036.697_2.343.wav_ASR	and the horses are gone
71-2_3039.7_1.22.wav_ASR	oh they're rats again
71-2_3041.9_5.82.wav_ASR	so she watches homeless in the back because you know they don't care what she's doing
71-2_3047.96_2.44.wav_ASR	and she could be out in the jungle the barn or whatever
71-2_3051.18_1.98.wav_ASR	and she remembers her mom
71-2_3053.64_0.44.wav_ASR	and she says
71-2_3054.52_2.96.wav_ASR	hey i got to see what it was like to be on the other side of it
71-2_3058.28_1.562.wav_ASR	maybe i can be contaminated
71-2_3059.842_2.694.wav_ASR	or maybe they're some other way that i can get out of here
71-2_3062.542_1.178.wav_ASR	at least i had
71-2_3064.362_9.62.wav_ASR	least i know that if i had the appropriate clothes i could walk into a security at that level and i could
71-2_3075.322_2.431.wav_ASR	many times he's back in the palace
71-2_3078.142_1.402.wav_ASR	he's chasing after her
71-2_3079.8_11.914.wav_ASR	it's point of what's going on in his brain is that all this money is all this one is playing hard because she left
71-2_3092.42_1.26.wav_ASR	so there's kind of a mystery there
71-2_3093.8_0.92.wav_ASR	and he's stuck the shoe
71-2_3095.48_0.44.wav_ASR	and he says
71-2_3096.62_2.419.wav_ASR	and i want that one more
71-2_3099.039_1.554.wav_ASR	and he says that to his father
71-2_3101.459_0.874.wav_ASR	well i will get married
71-2_3102.659_1.457.wav_ASR	well i'll do everything you want me to do
71-2_3104.319_1.26.wav_ASR	well for example my obituary
71-2_3106.019_2.317.wav_ASR	but i'm only gonna marry a woman i wanna be with
71-2_3108.479_1.188.wav_ASR	and i decided who it is
71-2_3109.899_0.481.wav_ASR	it's her
71-2_3110.579_0.492.wav_ASR	the prince
71-2_3111.559_1.82.wav_ASR	my firstnamem word
71-2_3113.739_1.359.wav_ASR	and i've got her shoe
71-2_3115.098_9.104.wav_ASR	so all i hafta do now is go around and see if i can figure out who's fit who's fit in to that shoe
71-2_3124.478_2.226.wav_ASR	and then that will be the person
71-2_3126.704_14.559.wav_ASR	because he's beginning to understand in his mind that there are some mathematical statistics and how much money they make
71-2_3141.263_17.44.wav_ASR	and he's beginning to think if they their souls could just be soul mates that that would be somebody positive in society was
71-2_3158.75_4.86.wav_ASR	so he's thinking at this point he's thinking much more broadly than his father is
71-2_3163.91_2.82.wav_ASR	and so they got this this bird
71-2_3167.87_7.62.wav_ASR	if he can find a woman who's feet fits into those glass slippers he will know who that person is
71-2_3175.61_0.918.wav_ASR	and they'll look at her
71-2_3176.528_4.36.wav_ASR	and you'll be able to know that this person that his shoe
71-2_3181.928_1.599.wav_ASR	and that the person that he will be
71-2_3184.23_8.169.wav_ASR	and because the way society works is if you're rich you can marry down but if you're you're not gonna be their choice
71-2_3192.59_7.512.wav_ASR	if you're poor and you wanna marry up you're gonna be vulnerable some kind of social climbers
71-2_3200.21_5.812.wav_ASR	so you're pretty much neat now in some way
71-2_3207.09_0.38.wav_ASR	so
71-2_3208.27_0.924.wav_ASR	he's male
71-2_3209.37_0.56.wav_ASR	and she's playing
71-2_3210.23_5.02.wav_ASR	and give the porsche limouses of them she doesn't get to ask him
71-2_3215.67_1.58.wav_ASR	he hasta ask her
71-2_3217.53_2.64.wav_ASR	and this is the goes back two hundred years
71-2_3220.23_10.62.wav_ASR	and this is and this is the way in which firstnamese two or three decades ago
71-2_3232.95_1.66.wav_ASR	so he's going around
71-2_3234.63_9.058.wav_ASR	and of course this is clearly an excellent way to find the part of the mystery woman who got away
71-2_3244.37_1.53.wav_ASR	but he's not well enough to do
71-2_3246.27_1.395.wav_ASR	and you see aphasia
71-2_3248.05_0.952.wav_ASR	you see the one i want
71-2_3249.19_4.215.wav_ASR	who saw the woman you know with the great carriage
71-2_3253.405_1.7.wav_ASR	firstnamej he useta call this doctor
71-2_3255.445_1.264.wav_ASR	everybody's looking for her
71-2_3256.825_0.684.wav_ASR	they can't find it
71-2_3258.025_3.705.wav_ASR	so we're gonna start with the the shoe because he's got something in front of him
71-2_3262.625_10.345.wav_ASR	and they appreciate that he will be going city to city see if women would come the woman that will fit the shoe
71-2_3273.59_2.54.wav_ASR	so first the stepdaughters
71-2_3276.77_4.492.wav_ASR	he passed away the night of the ball
71-2_3281.67_5.34.wav_ASR	but all we gotta do at this point is get our feet to fit into that shoe
71-2_3287.15_7.66.wav_ASR	and of course they look at this and realize that as soon as he finds the right one because he knows that as soon as he finds the right one
71-2_3298.01_6.16.wav_ASR	and clearly even if those shoes didn't fit the stepsisters it wouldn't match
71-2_3304.47_1.08.wav_ASR	her be no
71-2_3305.92_1.24.wav_ASR	just they'd be no customers
71-2_3307.5_1.43.wav_ASR	but you know they don't understand that
71-2_3309.14_4.5.wav_ASR	they're really behind in terms of understanding human relationships
71-2_3314.91_9.46.wav_ASR	firstnamec is she knows if she has the opportunity to connect with him again he can take her out of the situation that she's in
71-2_3324.63_1.94.wav_ASR	and they did consent
71-2_3326.99_0.66.wav_ASR	they should know
71-2_3327.87_0.666.wav_ASR	what do they did
71-2_3328.77_1.6.wav_ASR	it was very impressive
71-2_3331.15_16.88.wav_ASR	but for whatever reason because of the fairy godmother she's been given that opportunity to step out of her rule and move into a princess
71-2_3349.85_4.94.wav_ASR	so when they come up to the house both of the stepdaughters go
71-2_3355.33_3.9.wav_ASR	me try very hard to see if their feet will fit into the shoe
71-2_3359.65_1.118.wav_ASR	and they they don't
71-2_3361.07_2.251.wav_ASR	doing everything that he can
71-2_3363.39_2.46.wav_ASR	and this point the prince is just very distressed
71-2_3366.67_1.663.wav_ASR	he doesn't think he's gonna find her again
71-2_3368.45_4.78.wav_ASR	and he'll be stuck with somebody else that his father will probably arrange for him
71-2_3374.21_1.02.wav_ASR	and he finally said
71-2_3375.45_9.07.wav_ASR	there are other women in this house who could possibly be eligible for this
71-2_3385.34_2.26.wav_ASR	and cinderella stepsisters
71-2_3388.1_5.46.wav_ASR	and this is the biggest thing she's ever done because her stepmother is just gonna punish her for this after
71-2_3394.22_0.66.wav_ASR	and she said
71-2_3395.354_0.61.wav_ASR	here
71-2_3396.64_1.68.wav_ASR	and the stepmother turns and looks at it
71-2_3398.32_11.3.wav_ASR	and she's ready to punish her and firstnamer for a while and really make her life miserable
71-2_3410.66_4.26.wav_ASR	but the person that's working with the prince said
71-2_3415.8_1.04.wav_ASR	and he said everybody
71-2_3417.006_1.52.wav_ASR	oh mom i'm not now
71-2_3419.206_5.75.wav_ASR	and she stepped forward did bright at the family member
71-2_3426.49_1.26.wav_ASR	and she sits down
71-2_3428.266_4.56.wav_ASR	and her foot fits the shoe
71-2_3433.786_1.224.wav_ASR	the prince looks at her
71-2_3435.486_0.884.wav_ASR	her eyes meet
71-2_3437.19_5.92.wav_ASR	and once again he knows he's wet his
71-2_3444.51_11.84.wav_ASR	and at that point all of the power that the prince has to be able to protect her from her stepmother is kind of fun
71-2_3457.31_6.494.wav_ASR	all of her beautiful clothes come back though we're beginning to think this might be an illusion in the first place
71-2_3465.03_1.22.wav_ASR	the stepmother said
71-2_3467.17_0.966.wav_ASR	he's out of my hand
71-2_3468.27_3.048.wav_ASR	well i had no umbrella to punch her more
71-2_3471.91_15.74.wav_ASR	and the prince pulls her out and brings her back to the palace where she has been living
71-2_3488.11_2.18.wav_ASR	and she's gonna have to learn how to maneuver
71-2_3490.38_2.51.wav_ASR	her she's gonna learn how to talk better
71-2_3493.22_6.463.wav_ASR	so she's gonna learn how to control herself as a lady
71-2_3500.06_5.22.wav_ASR	all the things that are associated with with a higher social class
71-2_3505.28_7.11.wav_ASR	but because they connected at a human level this is gonna work
71-2_3569.68_4.16.wav_ASR	just thinking about telling you about the one i told you last
71-2_3574.16_1.744.wav_ASR	well i hafta come out of the news and that
71-2_3575.904_16.746.wav_ASR	when i was in the third grade which means i was very good with being able to read
71-2_3594.17_4.66.wav_ASR	but there were some details that i was not completely clear about
71-2_3599.49_5.1.wav_ASR	and one of those is what is a quarter after on a clock
71-2_3606.01_7.8.wav_ASR	and i mean i certainly knew that the order candle or hand was the hour
71-2_3614.27_3.18.wav_ASR	and the long hospital was the medicine
71-2_3618.41_10.9.wav_ASR	but for my professional from my my in my early twenties or a quarter after it met twenty five
71-2_3629.95_0.94.wav_ASR	didn't mean fifteen
71-2_3632.237_7.116.wav_ASR	and what it happened is my older sister was had stayed home sick that day
71-2_3640.43_4.54.wav_ASR	and i was supposed to go to her elementary school teacher
71-2_3645.277_2.053.wav_ASR	and she was in the fifteenth grade
71-2_3647.95_6.86.wav_ASR	and i was supposed to get her home home work and bring it home to her so that she could return the next day
71-2_3655.69_1.8.wav_ASR	and so i went to my therapist and said
71-2_3657.81_4.4.wav_ASR	and i'm sposta go to michigan state
71-2_3662.55_3.64.wav_ASR	and i'm supposed to pick up my sisters home
71-2_3667.09_0.66.wav_ASR	and she said
71-2_3668.13_1.372.wav_ASR	what do you go at court after
71-2_3669.502_1.648.wav_ASR	so i said
71-2_3671.37_0.632.wav_ASR	yeah i will
71-2_3672.79_7.687.wav_ASR	well i thought credit after was twenty five minutes after because in my mind that's what made sense
71-2_3680.63_1.36.wav_ASR	the courtier is twenty five minutes
71-2_3682.55_2.16.wav_ASR	three or four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve one one two three four five six seven eight nine ten
71-2_3685.29_6.464.wav_ASR	so far after will be three twenty five which is what she's saying
71-2_3691.83_1.241.wav_ASR	curtsy after the hour
71-2_3693.83_6.8.wav_ASR	so i waited till three twenty five minutes before the school is close
71-2_3701.57_3.218.wav_ASR	it's way too late for me to be going and doing what i'm supposed to be doing
71-2_3704.71_1.76.wav_ASR	you know i was sposta done at ten minutes earlier
71-2_3706.77_5.92.wav_ASR	well i'm watching the clock till exercise three twenty five and getting up and going to do what i'm supposed to do
71-2_3713.17_1.54.wav_ASR	and i ran out
71-2_3715.13_4.3.wav_ASR	and of course it's a mess because i'm missing the end of my class
71-2_3720.41_4.7.wav_ASR	her class last semester class is closed down
71-2_3726.15_4.02.wav_ASR	so i get back to my class probably at three thirty five
71-2_3730.99_3.236.wav_ASR	my teacher is still waiting there because my stroke is still in the hospital
71-2_3734.91_1.24.wav_ASR	did you wave so long
71-2_3736.33_0.6.wav_ASR	and she says
71-2_3737.07_2.17.wav_ASR	and i went actually when you told me to go
71-2_3739.78_1.66.wav_ASR	you told me to go to college
71-2_3742.38_0.58.wav_ASR	and she said
71-2_3743.24_2.52.wav_ASR	oh no you didn't go until three twenty five
71-2_3746.02_0.42.wav_ASR	and i said
71-2_3746.78_1.46.wav_ASR	but it's not that cardoform
71-2_3749.18_19.93.wav_ASR	and so at the age of eight i understand that when december firstnamed and their firstnamesj and not twenty five months after an hour and a half
71-2_3769.95_0.381.wav_ASR	oh how nice
71-2_3770.47_0.576.wav_ASR	oh i don't know
71-2_3783.83_0.927.wav_ASR	you know well to me
71-2_3784.77_0.667.wav_ASR	and i was eating
71-2_3785.65_0.876.wav_ASR	it's still messy
71-2_3786.87_2.118.wav_ASR	you know cut you know cuter after the hour
71-2_3788.988_1.9.wav_ASR	or cut it in half
71-2_3791.248_1.687.wav_ASR	they just weren't clear about it
71-2_3793.668_2.282.wav_ASR	now not that i actually talked back to them
71-2_3796.328_1.262.wav_ASR	you know i was in a hospital
71-2_3797.748_1.362.wav_ASR	you never talk back to anyone
71-2_3799.368_1.8.wav_ASR	well i was really confused
71-2_3809.35_6.62.wav_ASR	you think of a good bird
71-2_3816.149_18.351.wav_ASR	when i think to talk about this story i think i'm gonna talk about when i learned how to read because at the time i did i was asked if i could speak the bird
71-2_3836.08_11.38.wav_ASR	and of course growing up in an independent family which we never made my own thanksgiving dinner by myself
71-2_3847.78_2.32.wav_ASR	well generally we would go to my grandmother's house
71-2_3850.98_1.12.wav_ASR	and she had a little shower
71-2_3852.94_2.427.wav_ASR	so or josh
71-2_3855.367_3.059.wav_ASR	my father was the second oldest of that family
71-2_3859.04_2.22.wav_ASR	or job was to bring some life
71-2_3861.92_7.327.wav_ASR	and usually we would bring something else better than it be cinderella or something else bread
71-2_3869.707_2.393.wav_ASR	we never made the tour
71-2_3872.607_2.173.wav_ASR	you're never responsible for doing anything at all
71-2_3874.78_1.654.wav_ASR	that and we were talking
71-2_3876.434_0.914.wav_ASR	they're playing football
71-2_3877.82_5.48.wav_ASR	you know i hang out with my in the kitchen with the women because they were kind of restricted that
71-2_3883.46_1.96.wav_ASR	and the man would be in the living room watching football
71-2_3886.28_4.902.wav_ASR	and yeah you would just try to do those jelly rolls
71-2_3891.42_2.44.wav_ASR	but anyway i was by myself
71-2_3893.937_6.46.wav_ASR	well i think it was a cinderella and
71-2_3903.017_2.6.wav_ASR	and i was working as a waitress
71-2_3906.217_1.753.wav_ASR	and i didn't have a car
71-2_3909.03_2.46.wav_ASR	and i couldn't get enough time off from work
71-2_3911.917_1.736.wav_ASR	they didn't have enough cinderella there
71-2_3913.653_4.9.wav_ASR	so for whatever reason i hadta work on wednesday before thursday
71-2_3919.253_1.48.wav_ASR	and i was gonna be depressed
71-2_3920.873_2.933.wav_ASR	but i was gonna miss this big family event
71-2_3924.413_4.96.wav_ASR	but i decided that i was still going to make sure that i had the treatment
71-2_3929.773_1.74.wav_ASR	but i still had trouble
71-2_3931.715_1.84.wav_ASR	but i still had
71-2_3934.135_1.48.wav_ASR	that i still had distress
71-2_3935.995_1.437.wav_ASR	and those are the things i like to do
71-2_3937.995_2.438.wav_ASR	so i was gonna go through this because now i'm an adult right
71-2_3940.455_1.144.wav_ASR	and i know how to do all this
71-2_3941.995_1.475.wav_ASR	and why shouldn't i be able to do
71-2_3943.535_0.973.wav_ASR	it can't be hard
71-2_3945.135_1.145.wav_ASR	it comes out the other
71-2_3946.495_1.92.wav_ASR	it looks like you turn that on
71-2_3948.615_1.065.wav_ASR	you put the turkey
71-2_3949.895_1.065.wav_ASR	you leave it for a long time
71-2_3951.06_1.38.wav_ASR	five and eventually you pull it
71-2_3952.98_1.427.wav_ASR	and then you eat it right
71-2_3954.407_0.765.wav_ASR	can i do that
71-2_3956.5_5.3.wav_ASR	so the two daughters before thanksgiving after i'm called
71-2_3962.12_0.88.wav_ASR	and everyone was saying
71-2_3963.12_1.013.wav_ASR	you're not gonna be here
71-2_3964.3_1.612.wav_ASR	can't believe you're not gonna be her
71-2_3965.912_1.841.wav_ASR	and i'm feeling all depressed in all this
71-2_3967.94_2.64.wav_ASR	but i get home i pick up this turkey
71-2_3970.948_2.557.wav_ASR	and i don't get a particular big one
71-2_3973.708_0.995.wav_ASR	it's pretty big
71-2_3974.748_3.832.wav_ASR	probably twenty pounds which is certainly more than i need
71-2_3979.388_1.599.wav_ASR	but you know i don't know
71-2_3981.128_5.18.wav_ASR	smaller than the ones that my family has ever used for thanksgiving
71-2_3986.648_1.44.wav_ASR	so i pick up this
71-2_3989.32_4.94.wav_ASR	after i get home from work on wednesday i pull it out of the fridge
71-2_3994.86_1.6.wav_ASR	you kind of see where i'm going here with this
71-2_3997.14_1.16.wav_ASR	and pull it out of the fridge
71-2_3998.92_0.655.wav_ASR	and she says
71-2_3999.94_8.707.wav_ASR	if i put it in the morning on thursday morning i should be able to eat probably four or five months in the afterno
71-2_4008.6_3.427.wav_ASR	you know and you know i're you know how to make pies and all that stuff
71-2_4012.36_2.28.wav_ASR	and i stick it in the oven
71-2_4015.16_2.54.wav_ASR	my put tin foil over it
71-2_4018.12_1.74.wav_ASR	and i got the temperature correct
71-2_4020.98_0.76.wav_ASR	put it in
71-2_4022.48_2.3.wav_ASR	and you know in the meantime i'm getting really hungry
71-2_4025.22_1.08.wav_ASR	see you know the day is going
71-2_4026.96_2.58.wav_ASR	the other skills really good
71-2_4030.16_1.799.wav_ASR	well i'm already got the phone that are you
71-2_4032.82_2.322.wav_ASR	well i thought the police because i've had time to bake them
71-2_4035.7_1.44.wav_ASR	and i got to the hospital
71-2_4037.36_0.82.wav_ASR	and i'm watching tv
71-2_4038.6_1.326.wav_ASR	and so it's about four o'clock
71-2_4040.14_5.623.wav_ASR	and i invited my nextdoor neighbor to come over and help thanksgiving with me
71-2_4045.6_2.7.wav_ASR	and i pulled out of the hospital
71-2_4048.88_8.18.wav_ASR	and i open the other door pull out the the turkey and take off the tin foil
71-2_4058.22_5.156.wav_ASR	and all of a sudden i notice it's still kind of rough on the top
71-2_4063.76_1.56.wav_ASR	it's
71-2_4065.473_3.02.wav_ASR	and what apparently i didn't understand them
71-2_4068.773_3.506.wav_ASR	and i i didn't know that there's actually a process that yeah
71-2_4072.673_10.555.wav_ASR	so what i have is a turkey which is over cooked on the top part of it
71-2_4083.413_1.1.wav_ASR	there's blood everywhere
71-2_4084.791_4.6.wav_ASR	or you know when you wake up you're sposta have cereus
71-2_4089.731_1.877.wav_ASR	well i'm having blood coming out of it
71-2_4092.3_1.672.wav_ASR	well i got my next door neighbor
71-2_4094.631_1.127.wav_ASR	so what do we gonna eat
71-2_4095.771_0.429.wav_ASR	and i says
71-2_4096.271_1.769.wav_ASR	well it looks like it's not done yet
71-2_4098.231_1.569.wav_ASR	and i don't know why is taking this long
71-2_4101.011_1.629.wav_ASR	and i said
71-2_4103.091_0.989.wav_ASR	well let's see the guy
71-2_4104.66_1.34.wav_ASR	so i put it back in the up
71-2_4106.3_0.82.wav_ASR	we eat the pizza
71-2_4107.6_2.94.wav_ASR	we started eating you know whatever i've got in the house
71-2_4110.92_3.32.wav_ASR	and i keep opening the other door and chucking it
71-2_4114.46_1.1.wav_ASR	well not done
71-2_4115.9_3.62.wav_ASR	oh and finally at this point my my neurosurgeon
71-2_4119.66_2.687.wav_ASR	you know not really hungry anymore because we've been eating
71-2_4122.347_5.32.wav_ASR	and i think i had some macaroni and cheese in the refrigerator
71-2_4127.947_0.653.wav_ASR	we didn't know that
71-2_4128.987_0.853.wav_ASR	you're already having the problem
71-2_4130.887_1.513.wav_ASR	you know we're eating other stuff
71-2_4132.587_2.053.wav_ASR	you know we're drinking beer pretty much at that point
71-2_4135.127_1.673.wav_ASR	and it still just wasn't
71-2_4136.987_0.32.wav_ASR	well i said
71-2_4137.427_1.789.wav_ASR	think there's something wrong with my arm
71-2_4139.216_4.64.wav_ASR	for whatever reason this bird did not cut
71-2_4144.716_6.64.wav_ASR	so basically i finally took it out of the refrigerator
71-2_4152.1_1.576.wav_ASR	it was half cut
71-2_4154.1_6.54.wav_ASR	and then i found out the next day from my aunt that it was positive three or four days ago
71-2_4161.66_3.14.wav_ASR	and that's the only way that it's cool either
71-2_4164.8_10.968.wav_ASR	and i never told anybody other than my firstnamee did not work out is not because i forgot the thought
71-2_4175.98_2.66.wav_ASR	but because i told the other just didn't work
71-2_4178.98_0.94.wav_ASR	and that's the
71-2_4180.26_1.499.wav_ASR	that's the one i went with right
71-2_4181.86_0.46.wav_ASR	did not
71-2_4182.62_1.64.wav_ASR	they would have laughed at me forever
71-2_4184.269_5.704.wav_ASR	or they're not known to me for decades or not knowing something as basic as that
71-2_4190.749_3.091.wav_ASR	but it's the first bird i ever tried to
71-2_4194.709_2.56.wav_ASR	and there's they need to tell you the details
71-2_4197.749_2.931.wav_ASR	you know there's more involved than just sitting in the office
71-2_4201.309_1.4.wav_ASR	so no
71-2_4202.869_1.276.wav_ASR	well i didn't even tell you
71-2_4204.145_0.66.wav_ASR	but i didn't take
71-2_4205.385_11.22.wav_ASR	the next was actually inside paper and was stuck inside the newspaper which i didn't even know because it was too frozen
71-2_4217.465_4.355.wav_ASR	well when i finally was able to get it out i had paper in there too on top
71-2_4222.245_1.467.wav_ASR	cut them in half
71-2_4223.712_2.033.wav_ASR	essentially i ate it
71-2_4225.772_5.36.wav_ASR	and i just hacked it up and kind of took it in c t
71-2_4231.613_1.392.wav_ASR	but i don't use it all
71-2_4244.36_0.39.wav_ASR	and you said
71-2_4246.12_3.22.wav_ASR	oh okay
71-2_4250.31_12.91.wav_ASR	and going to talk about hotel that i stayed in when i was living in korea and was traveling with five other people
71-2_4263.273_6.26.wav_ASR	now in this particular case what it happened is we were on christmas breakfast
71-2_4270.133_3.68.wav_ASR	so we had a month off in which there were no classes
71-2_4274.793_1.429.wav_ASR	and so all of a sudden
71-2_4276.413_2.08.wav_ASR	we're about twenty five of us there
71-2_4278.663_5.439.wav_ASR	we were between the ages of ninety and twenty one and were in europe
71-2_4284.483_8.28.wav_ASR	and we have the ability to be able to use which means ambulance trusses which means ambulance trusses
71-2_4293.323_0.72.wav_ASR	you're basically
71-2_4294.543_3.437.wav_ASR	and i can't remember what it called at this point
71-2_4297.98_2.54.wav_ASR	but i think it was about hundred dollars you pay
71-2_4300.82_16.44.wav_ASR	you could actually go anywhere as far south as far north as long as far north as long as long ago
71-2_4317.626_3.34.wav_ASR	so you know we had all these ways of trying to do it
71-2_4321.286_2.024.wav_ASR	you know we would sleep on train
71-2_4323.546_4.404.wav_ASR	we would take things at night so that we wouldn't hafta worry about it
71-2_4328.866_1.9.wav_ASR	but we're now
71-2_4331.086_2.44.wav_ASR	we were several of us that were traveling
71-2_4333.686_1.58.wav_ASR	it was with a friend called firstnamec
71-2_4335.298_4.36.wav_ASR	and we were connecting in with firstnamec and firstnamec
71-2_4339.721_2.975.wav_ASR	and and we were coming
71-2_4342.838_1.313.wav_ASR	they traveled from somewhere else
71-2_4344.198_2.045.wav_ASR	we're all gonna meet together in room
71-2_4346.718_4.949.wav_ASR	and we figured we would also stay in a hotel together to save money you know
71-2_4351.738_2.52.wav_ASR	you would have two
71-2_4354.57_1.472.wav_ASR	so there was a camera
71-2_4356.47_1.518.wav_ASR	and one of us would sleep with firstnamec
71-2_4357.988_3.735.wav_ASR	and and then two women would be in the other both
71-2_4362.65_1.8.wav_ASR	so it's new york city right
71-2_4364.61_1.672.wav_ASR	because this is christmas
71-2_4366.73_2.06.wav_ASR	we arrived in raleigh
71-2_4369.51_2.46.wav_ASR	and the first thing we we would do when
71-2_4372.105_3.44.wav_ASR	and we were gonna meet with each other at the train station
71-2_4376.45_1.74.wav_ASR	we all met at the train station
71-2_4378.485_2.025.wav_ASR	we all got in with a half an hour of each other
71-2_4380.725_0.585.wav_ASR	we're connected
71-2_4381.31_17.334.wav_ASR	the first thing we would always do is go to the insurance center and get the firstnamesc and where the healthcare professionals are you know basically what we're gonna be
71-2_4399.31_1.66.wav_ASR	well there's a guy there working
71-2_4400.97_1.48.wav_ASR	and he was about twenty
71-2_4402.65_5.436.wav_ASR	very tricycle man who said
71-2_4408.77_2.324.wav_ASR	and he was just trying to figure with us too
71-2_4410.93_1.58.wav_ASR	well there're three americans women
71-2_4412.97_0.805.wav_ASR	this one guy
71-2_4414.09_1.187.wav_ASR	and he's traveling with us
71-2_4415.73_2.32.wav_ASR	and and he just said
71-2_4418.51_1.44.wav_ASR	oh you're gonna be in roll
71-2_4420.19_0.352.wav_ASR	and we said
71-2_4420.542_1.785.wav_ASR	you know we're gonna be in a couple of days
71-2_4423.022_0.528.wav_ASR	your phone
71-2_4423.642_1.191.wav_ASR	well we don't have plans
71-2_4425.142_0.92.wav_ASR	we're just traveling
71-2_4426.362_1.68.wav_ASR	and we're open to any explanation
71-2_4428.462_0.4.wav_ASR	and he said
71-2_4428.922_1.677.wav_ASR	well we're gonna be having a party tonight
71-2_4431.182_1.62.wav_ASR	who would you like to come to our party
71-2_4433.777_1.345.wav_ASR	and of course you know
71-2_4435.601_1.401.wav_ASR	car crash will come to your party
71-2_4437.262_1.273.wav_ASR	we don't know anybody here
71-2_4438.722_1.324.wav_ASR	of course we'll come to your parties
71-2_4440.046_0.685.wav_ASR	so now useta
71-2_4440.731_1.855.wav_ASR	we loved to go in theitalian party
71-2_4442.966_1.106.wav_ASR	and yeah
71-2_4444.486_4.06.wav_ASR	well see the movie the talk and take which news it could go very different
71-2_4448.786_0.842.wav_ASR	but that's not what happened
71-2_4450.606_1.32.wav_ASR	so we get our hotel
71-2_4453.086_0.895.wav_ASR	and we checking
71-2_4454.966_4.62.wav_ASR	and the guy behind the desk looked at all of us and said
71-2_4459.59_1.88.wav_ASR	you all wanna be in one room together
71-2_4462.21_0.62.wav_ASR	and we said
71-2_4463.448_1.886.wav_ASR	one one room two beds
71-2_4466.53_1.558.wav_ASR	and he looked at firstnamec
71-2_4468.088_2.082.wav_ASR	and and he pulled it aside and said
71-2_4470.79_1.3.wav_ASR	you must not be alert
71-2_4472.41_4.094.wav_ASR	if i were in that room i would not be able to sleep the entire night
71-2_4476.504_3.19.wav_ASR	they're tired night all of these beautiful women around
71-2_4480.57_2.338.wav_ASR	and he hadn't come out yet
71-2_4482.944_3.806.wav_ASR	but about a year later after that when we all had a reunion
71-2_4487.104_0.926.wav_ASR	you know i'm gay
71-2_4488.81_0.614.wav_ASR	and i said
71-2_4489.544_1.514.wav_ASR	oh we we didn't know that
71-2_4491.584_4.638.wav_ASR	yeah then i was thinking at the time you know he he actually knew he was dying
71-2_4496.25_7.099.wav_ASR	but one of the things that made him that was gay is when at that altitude man had said
71-2_4504.19_3.358.wav_ASR	we wouldn't be able to sleep if i were in the room with these beautiful women
71-2_4508.07_0.96.wav_ASR	and he was thinking
71-2_4509.29_1.838.wav_ASR	you know i'm not interested in anything
71-2_4511.51_1.94.wav_ASR	yes well eventually boston
71-2_4513.97_1.867.wav_ASR	well maybe there's a reason for that
71-2_4515.85_1.695.wav_ASR	yeah but i don't know
71-2_4518.19_2.637.wav_ASR	so we we we actually stopped with firstnamec
71-2_4520.91_0.704.wav_ASR	that was
71-2_4523.37_1.48.wav_ASR	and i mean there was no
71-2_4525.51_3.045.wav_ASR	they didn't matter i mean who we're gonna sleep with
71-2_4528.59_1.436.wav_ASR	he was like my brother at that point
71-2_4530.79_1.74.wav_ASR	so firstnamek and i stopped in one bed
71-2_4532.73_0.64.wav_ASR	it was a dog
71-2_4533.83_2.42.wav_ASR	and firstnamesc and firstnamec slipped in the other one
71-2_4536.43_6.242.wav_ASR	and we put all our stuff up you know our back packs and are sleeping bad
71-2_4542.95_1.454.wav_ASR	and we all went to this party
71-2_4544.65_2.441.wav_ASR	and everybody's really well dressed at this party
71-2_4547.69_2.18.wav_ASR	you work jeans
71-2_4558.543_1.81.wav_ASR	everybody's all mad up
71-2_4560.543_2.446.wav_ASR	and there we are looking like we look
71-2_4563.963_5.82.wav_ASR	and the whole thing at the party became the focus of
71-2_4569.795_5.22.wav_ASR	so this guy is sleeping with all three of you in the hospital
71-2_4575.455_8.129.wav_ASR	well that's all we talked about all night was just that firstnamew had three different women that he was having sex with
71-2_4583.835_2.445.wav_ASR	and so you know but
71-2_4586.535_3.105.wav_ASR	well first i could be an american man and travel with three women
71-2_4589.64_1.073.wav_ASR	and you know it
71-2_4591.62_1.186.wav_ASR	her husband was so embarrassed
71-2_4593.08_2.472.wav_ASR	oh oh well emergency by the whole thing
71-2_4595.68_0.879.wav_ASR	we
71-2_4597.78_4.75.wav_ASR	what's interesting is on the way back we stopped again in the bathroom
71-2_4602.76_3.63.wav_ASR	firstnamep came out of the bathroom and said
71-2_4607.06_1.72.wav_ASR	well i just had the raincoats on
71-2_4609.0_0.74.wav_ASR	and we're gonna be
71-2_4609.96_0.5.wav_ASR	help him
71-2_4610.475_1.125.wav_ASR	he said
71-2_4611.66_1.84.wav_ASR	well i was at the university
71-2_4614.02_1.751.wav_ASR	and i was standing there
71-2_4615.94_0.733.wav_ASR	and i was pee
71-2_4617.72_1.59.wav_ASR	and all of a sudden this man came
71-2_4619.54_4.24.wav_ASR	and he could have gone to the other side of the world of neurology
71-2_4624.08_1.411.wav_ASR	came and stood right next to me
71-2_4626.74_0.6.wav_ASR	and he said
71-2_4627.405_1.298.wav_ASR	and i don't know what that mean
71-2_4628.703_0.68.wav_ASR	and i says
71-2_4630.703_0.392.wav_ASR	oh no
71-2_4631.095_1.208.wav_ASR	you have a telephone you know
71-2_4632.523_0.44.wav_ASR	and he said
71-2_4633.223_4.051.wav_ASR	and he had the biggest peanut butter i ever seen
71-2_4637.563_0.429.wav_ASR	oh oh
71-2_4638.163_1.275.wav_ASR	you know some how
71-2_4640.283_2.322.wav_ASR	thinking about that a year later at kind of made sense
71-2_4642.723_0.997.wav_ASR	at the time i was
71-2_4643.84_0.556.wav_ASR	and i don't know
71-2_4644.543_1.18.wav_ASR	you see this is what it tells you
71-2_4645.732_10.149.wav_ASR	we just thought altitude men were so stressed that somebody would not be able to sleep when he's exhausted because
71-2_4656.872_1.771.wav_ASR	could not sleep if i were in that room
71-2_4658.952_2.411.wav_ASR	just couldn't manage all those women around them
71-2_4661.432_1.043.wav_ASR	we're sharing a bathroom
71-2_4663.072_0.5.wav_ASR	oh my
71-2_4663.885_1.9.wav_ASR	oh oh anyway yeah
71-2_4665.989_3.342.wav_ASR	that's better than the one where i hadta say
71-2_4669.685_0.92.wav_ASR	do you have any questions
71-2_4670.828_2.306.wav_ASR	and this is when i took you last week
71-2_4673.345_2.38.wav_ASR	and i don't have a lot of health stories
71-2_4676.085_0.796.wav_ASR	yeah and
71-2_4677.505_0.76.wav_ASR	that was now
71-2_4683.67_0.73.wav_ASR	thank you
71-2_4684.79_1.88.wav_ASR	we're very talk about my okeydo
71-2_4687.29_1.19.wav_ASR	so i'm coming up with a different word
71-2_4688.98_22.04.wav_ASR	well i useta have this thing that i would do to family members and friends which involved them in person
71-2_4711.28_5.98.wav_ASR	and what i would do is i would usually go cry
71-2_4718.12_0.593.wav_ASR	we're gonna get up
71-2_4718.88_1.542.wav_ASR	it would assume myself in the table
71-2_4720.7_0.485.wav_ASR	and i would go
71-2_4721.32_1.92.wav_ASR	and i would talk to the aphasia
71-2_4723.38_1.18.wav_ASR	and i would say something like
71-2_4724.78_0.758.wav_ASR	is my cousin
71-2_4725.64_1.14.wav_ASR	it's his birthday today
71-2_4727.48_2.1.wav_ASR	he doesn't like any attention
71-2_4729.698_4.925.wav_ASR	and so is there any point in time in which you could bring us a cake
71-2_4734.623_3.695.wav_ASR	and then we could really appreciate him singing really loud and around
71-2_4738.31_3.62.wav_ASR	and usually the weather stuff they're always
71-2_4742.318_0.971.wav_ASR	well we don't know how to do that
71-2_4743.298_0.762.wav_ASR	well that would be fun
71-2_4744.738_1.792.wav_ASR	so i had this thing about doing that
71-2_4746.63_5.9.wav_ASR	and very often i would bring my own candles be the kind that don't blow up
71-2_4752.99_5.848.wav_ASR	oh no you're right because then you can really realize people
71-2_4758.97_1.497.wav_ASR	yeah that was my
71-2_4761.43_2.915.wav_ASR	so it was my cousin's birthday
71-2_4764.86_4.14.wav_ASR	and his relationship with his girl friend has just ended
71-2_4769.48_3.76.wav_ASR	and he's always kind of quiet and and shy
71-2_4774.06_7.648.wav_ASR	so i decided that what we should really do is we should go a lot of attention to him because this would be good for him
71-2_4782.483_4.66.wav_ASR	so there were about fifteen of us there in the family
71-2_4787.403_2.28.wav_ASR	we're all sitting in the same
71-2_4790.743_1.267.wav_ASR	you're in the same boat
71-2_4792.783_6.78.wav_ASR	well i decided that would actually aid to the event if we had people singing from a distance around him
71-2_4800.425_7.26.wav_ASR	well i i took my knees and nephews with me to talk to the wheelchair staff
71-2_4808.085_1.875.wav_ASR	and firstnamee was then sick
71-2_4810.545_1.415.wav_ASR	and firstnamee was eight
71-2_4812.62_1.14.wav_ASR	so they came with me
71-2_4813.825_0.36.wav_ASR	and i said
71-2_4814.405_1.486.wav_ASR	what's what we're gonna do to deal
71-2_4815.905_1.236.wav_ASR	and we're going to go there
71-2_4817.285_1.99.wav_ASR	we're going to surprise him on his birthday
71-2_4819.275_11.285.wav_ASR	so what we hafta do is we hafta make sure that everybody understands at some point and that they shouldn't know in advance
71-2_4831.135_4.64.wav_ASR	so firstnamee is over talking to i don't know somebody else
71-2_4836.42_3.78.wav_ASR	and firstnamee and firstnamee are running and i am running around talking to everyone
71-2_4840.48_2.887.wav_ASR	okay now you hafta sing very loud
71-2_4843.64_1.672.wav_ASR	you gotta be very very quiet
71-2_4845.6_1.096.wav_ASR	yeah
71-2_4847.02_9.14.wav_ASR	so he hears firstnamee talking to the i think it was his brother probably my other cousin saying
71-2_4856.255_2.8.wav_ASR	now remember to sing very loudly loud
71-2_4859.535_1.02.wav_ASR	you know
71-2_4861.135_1.305.wav_ASR	and enjoying this whole process
71-2_4864.14_0.78.wav_ASR	and i don't know
71-2_4865.495_0.665.wav_ASR	can you be so nice
71-2_4866.355_0.48.wav_ASR	and he's crying
71-2_4867.715_1.611.wav_ASR	what are they going to do
71-2_4869.355_1.262.wav_ASR	he knew something was coming
71-2_4871.42_5.18.wav_ASR	but he didn't know about the type of protection that we had put in
71-2_4876.94_5.5.wav_ASR	do you know about the hospital animals that wouldn't been wouldn't blow out
71-2_4882.7_11.06.wav_ASR	he didn't know that we're gonna get the in the international west western state people were waiting on the tables to bring it
71-2_4894.34_6.12.wav_ASR	and he didn't know that everybody in my family would really enjoy the tire process though i know
71-2_4900.46_6.912.wav_ASR	and you know we get very kind of loud when we do things like this
71-2_4907.74_2.645.wav_ASR	you know of course they came from behind
71-2_4910.64_5.579.wav_ASR	and i only thought one food service was going to bring the cake
71-2_4917.02_1.8.wav_ASR	and firstnamese we had the six or so
71-2_4919.0_1.337.wav_ASR	everybody asked to come along
71-2_4920.337_2.048.wav_ASR	oh oh my gosh
71-2_4922.677_1.435.wav_ASR	it came from behind
71-2_4924.697_6.411.wav_ASR	he could tell that it was coming because everybody and the other side or raining and looking at him
71-2_4931.777_2.24.wav_ASR	and firstnamee and firstnamee just last
71-2_4934.457_1.743.wav_ASR	well really thinking around it tell
71-2_4936.937_0.93.wav_ASR	it's time to sing now
71-2_4938.097_0.862.wav_ASR	it's time to sing
71-2_4938.959_2.806.wav_ASR	you know and he got dead got done
71-2_4941.979_0.74.wav_ASR	he smiled
71-2_4943.099_1.014.wav_ASR	you blew it out
71-2_4944.419_1.009.wav_ASR	came back up again
71-2_4945.559_0.321.wav_ASR	and i says
71-2_4946.139_1.029.wav_ASR	you must be getting old
71-2_4947.999_3.841.wav_ASR	do you at least have the ability to call out the ambulance
71-2_4951.84_1.08.wav_ASR	just can you leave doo
71-2_4953.279_0.841.wav_ASR	and then
71-2_4955.019_0.65.wav_ASR	come on
71-2_4955.879_0.703.wav_ASR	it's going off
71-2_4956.739_1.861.wav_ASR	and he's looking at me
71-2_4958.6_2.165.wav_ASR	and he got down and said
71-2_4961.02_4.396.wav_ASR	you know firstnamep i'm gonna remember this
71-2_4965.96_1.081.wav_ASR	well i'm gonna remember that
71-2_4967.18_0.36.wav_ASR	and i said
71-2_4967.76_1.097.wav_ASR	was it a surprise
71-2_4968.88_0.538.wav_ASR	yes she says
71-2_4969.54_2.689.wav_ASR	it was not a surprise when i heard firstnamee say
71-2_4972.7_2.78.wav_ASR	remember to sing very loudly loud
71-2_4976.56_11.193.wav_ASR	so i think that i you know i think i handed the wheelchair i think i gave it off so well because she carried it off so well
71-2_4988.7_0.52.wav_ASR	and i said
71-2_4989.46_1.132.wav_ASR	it was so much fun
71-2_4990.7_0.32.wav_ASR	and she says
71-2_4991.1_1.881.wav_ASR	well unfortunately it's all much fun
71-2_4992.981_3.44.wav_ASR	and and firstnamee looked at me and just looked at me
71-2_4998.102_3.085.wav_ASR	well alright anyway that was fine
71-2_5001.681_0.427.wav_ASR	that is
71-2_5016.87_9.94.wav_ASR	back in the days when i would make peanut butter and jelly sandwich because of course i can't anymore for all sorts of reasons
71-2_5026.95_5.193.wav_ASR	shower is saturday and all of a sudden and all of a sudden it's
71-2_5032.23_5.632.wav_ASR	but back in the days when i would have done this what would've started out with the bread
71-2_5038.61_13.295.wav_ASR	and i would have toasted it because the test test works better for me than it comes to peanut butter and jelly
71-2_5052.65_3.64.wav_ASR	so i would begin by putting it in the toaster
71-2_5056.23_6.16.wav_ASR	and while it's toast out i would fold out the peanut butter and the jelly
71-2_5063.89_6.546.wav_ASR	when the bread comes out of the toaster i would begin with the peanut butter
71-2_5070.71_0.899.wav_ASR	that goes on the bottom
71-2_5071.89_4.232.wav_ASR	what i would do with a knife is i would pull out some peanut butter
71-2_5076.47_2.8.wav_ASR	well i would spread it evenly on the bread
71-2_5079.93_2.64.wav_ASR	then i would take the other piece of toast
71-2_5083.17_7.54.wav_ASR	and i would take a spoon and spoon out some jelly
71-2_5091.25_1.174.wav_ASR	rid it around even
71-2_5093.29_1.54.wav_ASR	and then put the two of them together
71-2_5095.33_3.74.wav_ASR	and probably slice it before eating
71-2_5100.37_1.46.wav_ASR	and i don't need things like that anymore
71-2_5102.25_1.58.wav_ASR	if i did that how i would do it
71-2_5111.35_0.5.wav_ASR	and
71-2_5112.173_4.003.wav_ASR	well i think we talked about last week
71-2_5116.353_4.662.wav_ASR	well i'm not done my lunch since last week which is why i really needta do it at this point
71-2_5122.17_24.64.wav_ASR	when i do laundry what i'm able to do is not separate them from color and white water which can also be washed in cold water which is also much better
71-2_5147.64_14.38.wav_ASR	so all of my children are already put aside because as close to firstnamem they ended up in my
71-2_5163.84_1.68.wav_ASR	so when it's time to do laundry
71-2_5205.68_2.96.wav_ASR	my plan is probably tomorrow
71-2_5208.96_5.54.wav_ASR	you have a break in between two different appointments that will allow me to do that
71-2_5214.8_4.46.wav_ASR	what i'm going to do is i pull into the laundry which is on the first wash
71-2_5221.0_3.28.wav_ASR	oh i think about twenty one hundred
71-2_5224.612_5.38.wav_ASR	and i will walk in two a mile size washer machine
71-2_5230.452_2.529.wav_ASR	well i will put all of my laundry in
71-2_5233.212_2.606.wav_ASR	well not separated by color or white
71-2_5236.572_4.435.wav_ASR	and i will then at the hospital at the hospital at the top of it
71-2_5241.89_6.96.wav_ASR	then i will put in enough carrots to be able to begin the cycle
71-2_5249.67_3.44.wav_ASR	and i will wash on my clothes on
71-2_5253.83_7.3.wav_ASR	after the courtors are in i push the cold water war
71-2_5261.412_5.86.wav_ASR	and then i take note of the fact that will take twenty five minutes for it to wash
71-2_5300.51_7.94.wav_ASR	because it towers and swirls and swirls and swirls and swirls that will take longer to dry
71-2_5309.73_7.36.wav_ASR	and then i threw it all in the hammer and take it home and then somebody pulled it or put it away
71-2_5317.17_8.72.wav_ASR	and sometimes i just take right out of the clean hammer and put it on my my my body or whatever i need it
71-2_5335.726_1.6.wav_ASR	and i said
71-2_5338.086_0.904.wav_ASR	well i've never done that
71-2_5339.206_1.26.wav_ASR	and i have tried
71-2_5341.05_1.916.wav_ASR	we'll make very clear that i have tracheotomy
71-2_5343.826_8.14.wav_ASR	and have not ever suggested in doing so for different reasons
71-2_5352.99_2.016.wav_ASR	if i wanted to do it correctly
71-2_5355.43_3.92.wav_ASR	and this is what it says on the cinderella
71-2_5360.33_1.64.wav_ASR	well which has never worked for me
71-2_5362.41_2.88.wav_ASR	but this is certainly the way that we would do
71-2_5365.51_1.04.wav_ASR	and i would get
71-2_5368.81_1.36.wav_ASR	or i would get it
71-2_5370.83_2.38.wav_ASR	and i would go to a plant
71-2_5374.88_3.677.wav_ASR	and there is one that about a mile and half away from where i live
71-2_5378.64_3.28.wav_ASR	and you buy a special type of
71-2_5384.1_1.523.wav_ASR	it it comes in a bag
71-2_5385.8_1.105.wav_ASR	and i think it is
71-2_5387.32_6.933.wav_ASR	well i know is that it's further enough that you should be able to grow things on it
71-2_5394.253_3.88.wav_ASR	and i would put this into a pot
71-2_5398.493_12.547.wav_ASR	and i would make sure that there was a old in it for firstnamel will be able to drain out into a tray
71-2_5412.06_6.94.wav_ASR	put the pot near a window so that there's enough
71-2_5420.54_3.72.wav_ASR	and what i would do is make sure that the
71-2_5424.56_4.012.wav_ASR	well first i would read the descriptions on the c t pc which i've done before
71-2_5429.36_2.358.wav_ASR	shoes you hafta go down about two inches
71-2_5431.718_2.05.wav_ASR	you take a seed
71-2_5434.438_1.243.wav_ASR	you please it
71-2_5436.118_0.689.wav_ASR	you call firstnamesc
71-2_5437.218_1.782.wav_ASR	you water it
71-2_5439.278_1.558.wav_ASR	and you leave it alone
71-2_5441.258_2.82.wav_ASR	and probably nurses takes it course
71-2_5444.438_5.88.wav_ASR	in my particular situation one time i didn't have enough sun
71-2_5451.69_10.26.wav_ASR	another time i simply over watered it to the point that the soil was so saturated that the seed root
71-2_5463.05_8.069.wav_ASR	and i think the other time it was too cold in my apartment to be able to struggle in the way that was supposed to
71-2_5471.119_2.542.wav_ASR	but i've seen other people do it
71-2_5473.819_1.78.wav_ASR	and i know the process exercise
71-2_5475.839_4.031.wav_ASR	well i just been able to actually do it in a way that makes it actually work
71-2_5480.75_10.703.wav_ASR	yeah so yes i'm still in the medical state of what you're supposed to be able to do
71-2_5491.453_11.589.wav_ASR	but i haven't figured out how to keep the soil dry enough so that it can spread out to the point that i forgot it
71-2_5503.85_5.443.wav_ASR	so i think there's a balance i haven't yet to be able to do it
84-1_17.07_2.48.wav_ASR	and i would hafta say one of my favorite trips
84-1_19.816_4.091.wav_ASR	my wife and i have two sons at old now
84-1_24.096_5.94.wav_ASR	and for a number of years we went skiing in united states
84-1_31.276_2.24.wav_ASR	and i really enjoyed the opera
84-1_33.838_6.2.wav_ASR	so my youngest was probably about three years old and my oldest was probably
84-1_40.738_1.181.wav_ASR	well it was probably a little later
84-1_42.198_2.46.wav_ASR	you like five and six and
84-1_45.878_4.42.wav_ASR	and i was just so much fun to get out there and and
84-1_50.529_3.88.wav_ASR	and i i could ski already but my two kids
84-1_55.149_1.45.wav_ASR	my wife sleep a little bit
84-1_56.809_3.24.wav_ASR	my two kids became pretty good girls
84-1_60.329_3.354.wav_ASR	and i'm pretty sure that a lot of them was
84-1_63.693_8.407.wav_ASR	we had a guy when we were in and in
84-1_72.333_1.915.wav_ASR	just lost the name of a place
84-1_74.633_3.58.wav_ASR	and when we were in the united states
84-1_78.653_2.88.wav_ASR	and we were gifted with him for a number of years
84-1_81.538_1.66.wav_ASR	he did a really good job
84-1_83.198_9.633.wav_ASR	and i hope that will give me a little bit of sense of how much i enjoy my kids and nobody i enjoyed seeing them well when i couldn't
84-1_100.218_1.397.wav_ASR	it was very nice
84-1_127.149_12.52.wav_ASR	well i just got upset to be part of the bar again in philadelphia and pennsylvania
84-1_141.089_3.08.wav_ASR	well i would say my my my skills
84-1_144.711_5.549.wav_ASR	and i i i think my skills are pretty good
84-1_150.311_2.822.wav_ASR	they're never gonna be great as they once were
84-1_153.811_8.199.wav_ASR	so i would say on a scale one to ten right now i would say i'm probably a cinderella
84-1_162.21_3.04.wav_ASR	and so i feel like i'm made a lot of progress
84-1_165.81_5.761.wav_ASR	but i know that there's more progress i need to make especially with big words
84-1_172.07_1.91.wav_ASR	big words can be difficult for me
84-1_174.17_3.53.wav_ASR	so i do see a speech therapist once a week
84-1_177.77_3.733.wav_ASR	and she's been extremely excellent for me
84-1_181.503_0.887.wav_ASR	and i like her
84-1_182.39_6.734.wav_ASR	and i also have some work out of me
84-1_189.203_1.429.wav_ASR	the two of them are just great
84-1_196.9_1.27.wav_ASR	oh i remember that pretty well
84-1_207.12_2.95.wav_ASR	well my wife was aware for the week
84-1_210.39_2.78.wav_ASR	you had a house in oxford memorial
84-1_214.15_3.64.wav_ASR	and i remember that week end because i hadta work
84-1_217.968_4.82.wav_ASR	and i thought the biggest thing we could do for the week and was to stay home
84-1_223.738_8.03.wav_ASR	so i think she probably went down there on maybe wednesday or thursday
84-1_232.508_2.66.wav_ASR	and i came home from work on friday
84-1_236.128_0.848.wav_ASR	had dinner
84-1_236.976_0.998.wav_ASR	and i did some work
84-1_238.176_2.0.wav_ASR	and i get up the next morning
84-1_240.536_5.24.wav_ASR	well that was the thirtieth
84-1_247.676_1.721.wav_ASR	and i felt pretty good
84-1_249.716_1.188.wav_ASR	when i went about my day
84-1_251.576_2.08.wav_ASR	and i went out for a bicycle ride
84-1_254.296_1.0.wav_ASR	and i came home
84-1_255.22_20.6.wav_ASR	and and that night was the night that ruled the world maybe after four or five
84-1_276.504_5.66.wav_ASR	and so on saturday night i went to bed a little bit earlier
84-1_282.524_4.46.wav_ASR	well i thought they might be some biology
84-1_287.724_3.66.wav_ASR	and i also thought it would be helpful in the mornings
84-1_291.464_1.784.wav_ASR	so i could clean up a little bit
84-1_293.7_2.69.wav_ASR	so we live in florida
84-1_297.14_2.43.wav_ASR	and i went to bed around ten thirty
84-1_300.6_5.7.wav_ASR	and that night saturday night there was a lot of volunteers in indiana philadelphia
84-1_307.16_3.84.wav_ASR	and i remember that that was burned
84-1_315.929_2.242.wav_ASR	and so i got up
84-1_318.529_2.98.wav_ASR	oh i i live in a fairly secure place
84-1_322.129_4.884.wav_ASR	and the next morning i got up really early and went outside
84-1_327.229_1.08.wav_ASR	it was a total mess
84-1_329.189_1.324.wav_ASR	so i started cleaning up
84-1_331.129_3.4.wav_ASR	and sometimes the during the day i felt a little bit shakier
84-1_334.969_1.819.wav_ASR	so i went back home
84-1_337.0_1.019.wav_ASR	and i rested for a little
84-1_338.309_1.26.wav_ASR	we went out got a paper
84-1_340.069_2.184.wav_ASR	and then i felt pretty good for the rest of the day
84-1_342.769_10.717.wav_ASR	and sometimes on that sunday night between may june first and august i mean and firstnamee firstnamem and firstnamee firstnamese firstnamese firstnamese firstnamese firstnamese firstnamese firstnamese firstnamese firstnamese firstnamese firstnamese firstnamese firstnamese firstnamese firstnamese firstnamese firstnamese firstnamese firstnamese firstnamese firstnamese firstnamese firstnamese firstnamese firstnamese firstnamese firstnamese firstnamese firstnamese firstnamese firstnamese firstnamese firstnamese firstnamese firstnamese firstnamese firstnamese firstnamese firstnamese firstnamese firstnamese firstnamese firstnamese firstnamese firstnamese firstnamese firstnamese firstnamese firstnamese firstnamese firstnamese firstnamese firstnamese firstnamese firstnamese firstnamese firstnamese firstnamese firstnames
84-1_354.11_3.04.wav_ASR	and in the morning my wife could not get a hold of me
84-1_357.75_1.397.wav_ASR	so we have a dollar amount here
84-1_359.39_0.831.wav_ASR	and he went out
84-1_360.85_1.3.wav_ASR	and i was on the floor
84-1_362.37_2.0.wav_ASR	and so he called an ambulance
84-1_364.67_4.58.wav_ASR	my my wife was in oxford maryland
84-1_369.477_7.22.wav_ASR	so she was told that i had better that
84-1_377.397_1.08.wav_ASR	and i'm bad with pronouns
84-1_378.897_3.68.wav_ASR	that my wife would come home
84-1_382.428_8.24.wav_ASR	and i have two sons one who is in northwestern and one who is in southwestern
84-1_391.348_6.86.wav_ASR	and they were told it was probably a good idea for them to come home because i wasn't sure what was gonna happen
84-1_398.267_6.5.wav_ASR	and so i remember distinctly that i was brought into the emergency room
84-1_405.227_2.72.wav_ASR	and apparently i i could not say loud enough
84-1_407.987_2.86.wav_ASR	my my voice was very garbled
84-1_411.47_14.3.wav_ASR	but the end by the end of the period my my wife told me later that she she wasn't sure what kind of shape i'd be in
84-1_425.77_14.463.wav_ASR	but by the end of the surgery which was awful she thought the surgery thought that i was going to be able to live
84-1_440.31_3.579.wav_ASR	they didn't know how much exercise i'll be able to do
84-1_444.38_6.0.wav_ASR	so i i spent about six weeks in raleigh
84-1_451.21_2.29.wav_ASR	and i came out not sure what i could
84-1_453.84_4.18.wav_ASR	so today i i feel pretty good about my voice
84-1_458.6_2.9.wav_ASR	because i said i still feel like there's more i can do
84-1_462.06_4.25.wav_ASR	so as i think i'm about seventy percent right now
84-1_478.63_9.28.wav_ASR	well i was in rehab for eight weeks about a place that's about maybe eight blocks from here
84-1_488.29_1.76.wav_ASR	and it was a time when it was covid
84-1_490.47_3.04.wav_ASR	so it wasn't really easy for me to see people
84-1_494.13_3.84.wav_ASR	well one of the people we live
84-1_498.084_2.28.wav_ASR	because i live in a high story building
84-1_501.2_9.29.wav_ASR	one of the persons was maybe the second or third command at firstnamej which is where i went to for my rehab
84-1_511.17_8.41.wav_ASR	and this person who's name is firstnamek was allowed to get two people into see me at day
84-1_520.09_3.903.wav_ASR	well i got to see well my two sisters came in
84-1_524.19_2.789.wav_ASR	and my my children came in
84-1_527.21_2.02.wav_ASR	and then my wife came in
84-1_529.33_4.5.wav_ASR	so i had a very good teacher
84-1_534.47_8.45.wav_ASR	and so each day i would have o t p t and speech
84-1_543.73_2.66.wav_ASR	well that was every day except for saturday and sunday
84-1_554.07_3.15.wav_ASR	well what and there's nothing i can do about it
84-1_558.98_2.94.wav_ASR	so i i mean i understand i hadta deal with that
84-1_562.65_2.916.wav_ASR	and all of a sudden all these deals with it but i try to
84-1_590.17_3.99.wav_ASR	well i hafta tell you i've had a pretty good life until my stroke
84-1_595.73_3.421.wav_ASR	well i would say that one of the best things that ever happened to me was
84-1_599.151_7.46.wav_ASR	and i was in a program at a school called firstnamep
84-1_607.212_12.7.wav_ASR	and when i was there part of the this program revealed it made it so that i hadta spend a semester a
84-1_620.93_9.96.wav_ASR	and drowning in seven grade through high school and then into college i spoke french pretty well
84-1_631.61_7.66.wav_ASR	because i had a teacher in in washington who was at the time going out with one of the cubbies baseball players
84-1_639.596_3.36.wav_ASR	and so she was friends
84-1_643.098_1.783.wav_ASR	and she useta talk about that a lot
84-1_645.456_2.323.wav_ASR	and so i took a class from her
84-1_648.376_1.811.wav_ASR	and somehow i did pretty well
84-1_650.376_6.36.wav_ASR	so when i was in the program at at westminster
84-1_657.064_3.6.wav_ASR	and i would say one of the happiest occasions for me was graduation
84-1_661.59_8.094.wav_ASR	well i i won't be doing pretty well at the school and even though i had gotten in on a wait list
84-1_670.684_1.52.wav_ASR	and it was really exciting
84-1_672.25_9.12.wav_ASR	and i i i knew a bunch of people in my class but i was really close with the class of eighty
84-1_681.67_2.875.wav_ASR	and it was just a fun time for me
84-1_684.545_1.765.wav_ASR	well i was president of my fraternity
84-1_687.01_6.06.wav_ASR	and i i met someone who became one of my closest friends
84-1_693.27_2.1.wav_ASR	he was the professor at wisconsin
84-1_695.55_2.306.wav_ASR	so i it was really nice
84-1_698.38_8.68.wav_ASR	after i graduated from high school i spent some vacation with him and some of my relatives
84-1_707.68_2.16.wav_ASR	he he was someone who was remarried
84-1_710.58_2.476.wav_ASR	he went to harvard law school
84-1_713.273_5.48.wav_ASR	and at the end of his freshman year he went down to the mud club college
84-1_719.733_2.72.wav_ASR	and he went down to the books store
84-1_722.973_3.56.wav_ASR	and he bought all books about american history
84-1_726.863_7.22.wav_ASR	so he went back to go back to campus and he changed
84-1_734.443_1.76.wav_ASR	he was already in college
84-1_736.563_2.08.wav_ASR	he'd been under general anesthesia
84-1_739.263_4.24.wav_ASR	and he and he after his first year of wind the mooc he said
84-1_743.663_0.992.wav_ASR	it wasn't for me
84-1_744.8_5.82.wav_ASR	and he went to at harbor he went to a program in atlanta russia
84-1_756.57_3.48.wav_ASR	yeah i i was really it was a good place for me
84-1_764.754_4.32.wav_ASR	and i haven't been visiting since my stroke
84-1_769.655_5.279.wav_ASR	but i useta be familiar involved it at the university
84-1_775.834_6.1.wav_ASR	and my youngest my youngest son went there after spending a year and a half
84-1_782.807_7.94.wav_ASR	and he did really well at the school
84-1_790.907_3.04.wav_ASR	so i was very excited for him
84-1_828.61_2.67.wav_ASR	well i happened to know these pictures well
84-1_832.07_3.18.wav_ASR	it's a story about a kid playing soccer
84-1_836.05_3.3.wav_ASR	and he sticks the ball
84-1_839.99_3.52.wav_ASR	and went went through the window of a near house
84-1_843.796_24.848.wav_ASR	and later on side the one of the young or middle age husband was married by one of the older people who lived in the house
84-1_868.644_20.254.wav_ASR	and then he looked out the window to see if he could hit the soccer ball so that landed on his lap i think
84-1_907.89_1.94.wav_ASR	the this one i'll know
84-1_909.988_8.342.wav_ASR	it's about a young boy who when he went to school he was determined whether or not to take an umbrella
84-1_918.59_2.6.wav_ASR	he decided not to take the umbrella
84-1_921.69_2.48.wav_ASR	and it turned out that it it started raining
84-1_924.87_1.88.wav_ASR	so he went back home
84-1_926.94_1.818.wav_ASR	and he was soaking wet
84-1_929.34_2.127.wav_ASR	but i apparently he changed his clothes
84-1_932.02_5.76.wav_ASR	and he went back outside with a umbrella so that he could get to school
84-1_938.24_6.041.wav_ASR	well i assume he went to school on time but i really don't know whether that's part of the story or not
84-1_957.58_7.15.wav_ASR	so this is a little girl maybe under ten who had a cat who was stuck up in the tree
84-1_965.45_7.58.wav_ASR	so apparently the dad got off his get a ladder
84-1_973.283_3.967.wav_ASR	girl girl was on tricycle
84-1_977.59_1.904.wav_ASR	and he stopped and looked at the cat
84-1_979.94_19.956.wav_ASR	so the the the the the cat went up to get the the the the the the the father went up to get the cat
84-1_999.896_13.754.wav_ASR	and i guess the the ladder got kicked away so that the husband was stuck up there with the cat
84-1_1014.556_2.6.wav_ASR	and the dog started barking
84-1_1017.78_2.68.wav_ASR	and eventually the fire department came
84-1_1021.24_0.94.wav_ASR	they were able
84-1_1022.44_0.5.wav_ASR	prince
84-1_1023.32_0.654.wav_ASR	don't know
84-1_1024.06_3.563.wav_ASR	but i think they were able to get the cat and get the man down
84-1_1188.54_7.06.wav_ASR	so this is a story about a young woman named cinderella
84-1_1196.189_19.982.wav_ASR	and she was working at a police lady and two people who had grown up with her and were interested in trying to get someone to marry them
84-1_1216.59_15.38.wav_ASR	so it turned out that the that there was an young prince who was living with her with his family
84-1_1232.85_29.52.wav_ASR	and the young person could find out if the people from the community could find out if the people were positive interested in in having a relationship with the prince
84-1_1263.48_2.52.wav_ASR	well i don't remember the name of the president
84-1_1266.09_4.89.wav_ASR	but so they sent her out an invitation to all the people in the community
84-1_1272.04_9.98.wav_ASR	and the two young ladies who lived with her who lived with her
84-1_1284.38_8.84.wav_ASR	her older mother decided that they would go to the ball and started getting dressed to go to the ball
84-1_1293.98_17.52.wav_ASR	but cinderella who was a carriage and was stuck doing things like washing clothes and cleaning the floor and stuff like that she found out about their being this
84-1_1312.413_4.54.wav_ASR	and she wanted to know if there was some way she could attend
84-1_1317.593_1.78.wav_ASR	so she said
84-1_1320.333_2.28.wav_ASR	don't remember exactly how it happened
84-1_1323.133_6.02.wav_ASR	and she was able to get into touch with somebody i think they called the fairy
84-1_1330.065_3.52.wav_ASR	and she talked to the fairy godmother
84-1_1334.45_20.985.wav_ASR	and so while the two people from the house were going with her her old lady to the dance she decided that she could go
84-1_1355.435_4.2.wav_ASR	so she got dressed up in fancy clothes
84-1_1360.415_5.337.wav_ASR	and she was told by the fairy godmother that she could go to the ball
84-1_1365.795_1.72.wav_ASR	but she had only one recall
84-1_1368.295_2.94.wav_ASR	and that is that she be back by midnight
84-1_1371.407_11.811.wav_ASR	so she went to the ball and fell in love with the prince and was having a good time with the prince
84-1_1383.218_12.28.wav_ASR	but when the clock struck midnight cinderella knew that she hadta get out of there
84-1_1396.098_5.08.wav_ASR	so she raised for the door and down the steps and into the carriage
84-1_1401.35_2.26.wav_ASR	but soon the carriage
84-1_1404.69_9.9.wav_ASR	and she was by herself with i think some young people who may have been rabbits and other members of the community
84-1_1415.23_19.09.wav_ASR	so she found out that the young princess was looking for the young lady who had disappeared at midnight
84-1_1434.84_11.51.wav_ASR	and he sent out a i guess some sort of plea or something that if the person was around she should close contact him
84-1_1446.76_12.16.wav_ASR	and when that didn't happen then a young man went around the village to see if by chance anybody knew anything about this young girl
84-1_1459.92_3.1.wav_ASR	and when she went to the house that had the two
84-1_1463.595_2.1.wav_ASR	because you might be now called
84-1_1468.04_9.89.wav_ASR	and she i think somehow got a hold of cinderella who may be watching clothes in the basement or something
84-1_1478.88_7.897.wav_ASR	and when she was brought upstairs the one shoe that had been left behind she tried on that one shoe
84-1_1486.777_13.623.wav_ASR	and it fit her so that the young prince was going to communicate this young lady
84-1_1501.077_2.06.wav_ASR	and so i guess they got back together
84-1_1503.537_1.94.wav_ASR	and eventually they got married
84-1_1550.75_3.76.wav_ASR	never really had a lot of exercises with clots
84-1_1555.47_3.2.wav_ASR	it was pretty much always on time
84-1_1559.37_10.68.wav_ASR	and when i was in high school there for some reason was no real time on what time i had to get home
84-1_1570.61_8.74.wav_ASR	so i went to a lot of parties on friday night and saturday night and could come home when i wanted
84-1_1579.38_20.6.wav_ASR	and i think it was the last part of my two schools decided that you know that the two of them really hadta teach me how to be comfortable with myself and when to be able to know when i was out too late
84-1_1600.084_3.495.wav_ASR	so i mean there were a few times when i was out late
84-1_1604.124_2.309.wav_ASR	nothing really ever happened to me
84-1_1606.924_3.866.wav_ASR	and then when i went to college i would come home during the summer
84-1_1611.804_6.56.wav_ASR	and i remember that i was involved with a couple young ladies
84-1_1618.528_4.623.wav_ASR	but i would go out with them but i couldn't get home when i wanted to
84-1_1623.52_6.58.wav_ASR	and i remember one summer i had a job that required me to be at work at six o'clock in the morning
84-1_1630.928_3.42.wav_ASR	so sometimes during the summer i would stay at home and then go to work
84-1_1645.61_7.485.wav_ASR	well so i worked a lot particular when i had i turned out to be
84-1_1653.47_2.186.wav_ASR	think i may have told this
84-1_1655.73_0.463.wav_ASR	and i said
84-1_1656.193_3.42.wav_ASR	but i worked for a french company for one
84-1_1660.878_8.049.wav_ASR	and i when i had my stroke i started thinking about things i could do
84-1_1668.927_8.2.wav_ASR	because really between vacation and between a lot of time i spent particularly with my children
84-1_1678.067_2.92.wav_ASR	they were in a town in new jersey called princess
84-1_1681.727_2.08.wav_ASR	and they both played a lot of hockey
84-1_1684.367_2.89.wav_ASR	so i never really had a lot of time
84-1_1687.246_2.783.wav_ASR	but one thing i've decided i'm going to do
84-1_1690.506_4.76.wav_ASR	with in the next year we're gonna be moving a little further south
84-1_1695.886_3.08.wav_ASR	and i thought that one thing i could do was bird
84-1_1699.586_2.933.wav_ASR	because i've always had an interest in that
84-1_1702.606_1.984.wav_ASR	well i've never really focused on that
84-1_1705.086_1.62.wav_ASR	and i really thought particularly
84-1_1706.856_2.9.wav_ASR	now i ride a three wheel bicycle
84-1_1709.936_4.506.wav_ASR	and i can't write a two wheel bicycle like i useta do
84-1_1714.521_16.081.wav_ASR	so i'm really hoping that we move i can learn about birds and maybe become because i think that would be a good thing for me to do
84-1_1736.76_2.52.wav_ASR	oh so did she live in bloomington
84-1_1760.0_20.64.wav_ASR	well i guess when i started traveling for this french company when i started the prophecies cinderella and mexican
84-1_1780.938_3.5.wav_ASR	but they quickly figured out that i could speak
84-1_1785.098_1.94.wav_ASR	so the girls were in front
84-1_1787.898_2.948.wav_ASR	and i was one of the few girls outside of france
84-1_1791.078_1.06.wav_ASR	it was in the united states
84-1_1793.658_4.48.wav_ASR	well they useta send me to various places
84-1_1798.398_5.96.wav_ASR	and i remember that i stayed in a real nice hotel in
84-1_1805.978_2.42.wav_ASR	and i also stayed in a nice hotel
84-1_1809.158_3.84.wav_ASR	when i was in a nice hotel when i went to china
84-1_1813.177_5.8.wav_ASR	and i also was in a nice hotel when i was in
84-1_1822.457_6.54.wav_ASR	so i and during one of the times i was there and it was the fourth of july
84-1_1829.537_3.16.wav_ASR	so i remember that the stepbrother got me a little cake
84-1_1833.15_7.12.wav_ASR	so i i i don't really need a big o t all of my wife likes them
84-1_1841.05_10.3.wav_ASR	oh i always thought i was in places that i could be comfortable even when
84-1_1851.626_2.28.wav_ASR	you i i do remember saying one month old
84-1_1854.01_5.896.wav_ASR	well i was in birmingham alabama for to be part of a case that was pending
84-1_1860.446_2.235.wav_ASR	and we stayed in a god hotel the hotel
84-1_1862.726_3.066.wav_ASR	even though even that turned out to be good for me
84-1_1865.941_11.7.wav_ASR	so it was a good way for me to learn about the way different hospitals can treat me different
84-1_1878.421_3.38.wav_ASR	well i was in a hotel in a bed part of town at firstnameb
84-1_1882.0_1.381.wav_ASR	remember that pretty well
84-1_1897.088_7.408.wav_ASR	well when i was in college there was firstnamesp
84-1_1904.816_0.654.wav_ASR	and i told you
84-1_1905.47_0.58.wav_ASR	the problem
84-1_1906.59_6.9.wav_ASR	and over the three and over thirty five years
84-1_1913.91_2.92.wav_ASR	and in nineteen ninety nine he died
84-1_1917.85_5.54.wav_ASR	but before that time she and a group of people
84-1_1923.607_16.1.wav_ASR	there was one person from the class of sixty one one person who was me and a person from the class of eighty
84-1_1939.914_5.6.wav_ASR	the three of us or the six five of us became very good friends
84-1_1945.874_9.776.wav_ASR	and every year because firstnamew did not have any friends
84-1_1955.75_8.1.wav_ASR	he had a child who died when when when he was i think maybe six or seven years old
84-1_1964.11_8.96.wav_ASR	and so one thing he useta do once a quarter from november he'll us useta go out to new york city
84-1_1973.501_5.94.wav_ASR	and we we we would i went for my graduation
84-1_1979.861_3.68.wav_ASR	and i went for every year there after about twenty five years
84-1_1983.921_5.12.wav_ASR	well i went to a place that's no longer an exercise but it's called delu
84-1_1989.678_3.6.wav_ASR	and it was a very nice
84-1_1994.718_3.712.wav_ASR	and we just had a wonderful time ever year
84-1_1998.43_14.51.wav_ASR	so i really think back on that last month i had with these people and how much fun i still keep in contact with them
84-1_2012.94_5.74.wav_ASR	and so these people are very well known people
84-1_2019.2_6.8.wav_ASR	and so i've already had one of the wheels has already died
84-1_2026.88_4.22.wav_ASR	he was the head of this thing called the
84-1_2031.651_17.0.wav_ASR	it's a big it's a big for a family
84-1_2048.851_0.828.wav_ASR	they forgot the name
84-1_2049.811_1.4.wav_ASR	they have a huge truck
84-1_2051.568_3.28.wav_ASR	and so he's gonna retire and move back to new york
84-1_2055.648_10.086.wav_ASR	so i'm very excited that at the end summer i'm gonna be meeting with them and these people who go back to the class of six two
84-1_2066.128_2.086.wav_ASR	so i'm looking forward to it
84-1_2068.397_8.98.wav_ASR	and i some days i i would be in a little better strength than i am now
84-1_2077.677_3.26.wav_ASR	they all know i had a stroke
84-1_2081.677_3.36.wav_ASR	and i i'm really looking forward
84-1_2085.17_5.06.wav_ASR	most days sometimes i think that maybe i shouldn't go because i'm not far enough long
84-1_2090.73_1.56.wav_ASR	but it's
84-1_2093.19_1.8.wav_ASR	can't remember what we were talking about
84-1_2100.86_4.44.wav_ASR	so so we went to this very nice restaurant
84-1_2105.464_2.296.wav_ASR	we did it for about twenty five years
84-1_2108.22_5.907.wav_ASR	and it was a place for me and for the other people that were in the group
84-1_2114.08_11.39.wav_ASR	we useta do it every year in december because our family people from the firstnamem people had a birthday
84-1_2132.16_4.04.wav_ASR	it was a french restaurant called louisville
84-1_2137.66_14.62.wav_ASR	well it's if you go back to the Nineteen seventies and eighty five years ago two fifty nine years ago
84-1_2152.28_7.02.wav_ASR	you know it's in a nice old building that has three or four floors
84-1_2159.56_1.7.wav_ASR	and it was excellent
84-1_2161.495_22.32.wav_ASR	and because firstnamew he knew the staff really well so that when we came in for the birthday party it was just fantastic
84-1_2184.085_1.14.wav_ASR	it was really nice
84-1_2189.53_1.988.wav_ASR	it's not there anymore yeah
84-1_2191.525_0.84.wav_ASR	it was so
84-1_2192.725_1.984.wav_ASR	there was an honor and his wife
84-1_2195.385_3.86.wav_ASR	and i think they eventually you know was
84-1_2199.985_8.94.wav_ASR	and they sold the restaurant to a guy who was i think from either french or german
84-1_2210.365_2.624.wav_ASR	and he did not do a very good job
84-1_2212.939_7.3.wav_ASR	so it i would say after three or four years it it doesn't exercise anymore
84-1_2224.89_2.489.wav_ASR	you know we're so we're going to
84-1_2228.519_2.26.wav_ASR	well the fellow who was
84-1_2231.118_5.52.wav_ASR	because i couldn't remember the name of the place that he was involved in my accident
84-1_2237.538_4.0.wav_ASR	but he has one son who's got three wonderful children
84-1_2242.058_2.84.wav_ASR	and they live in north carolina
84-1_2245.216_14.64.wav_ASR	so my my friend who's now wold is has fixed up a place i think in the fifty or sixty years in new york
84-1_2260.677_6.594.wav_ASR	so i know that's where the party's gonna be because the aftermath is apparently finished now
84-1_2267.297_1.81.wav_ASR	he's been working on it for a couple years
84-1_2290.78_3.59.wav_ASR	oh interestingly enough i had one for lunch
84-1_2296.1_4.56.wav_ASR	you i like it once in a while
84-1_2300.734_16.34.wav_ASR	one of the people who was part of the group one of six or six five
84-1_2317.101_4.2.wav_ASR	and he has a peanut butter and jelly sandwich every day for lunch
84-1_2321.761_2.78.wav_ASR	well what you do is you take two pieces of bread
84-1_2325.321_9.159.wav_ASR	my bread i have my bread in the freezer because i only use a certain amount of it every day
84-1_2335.061_1.789.wav_ASR	so i take the pieces of bread out
84-1_2336.89_7.96.wav_ASR	and i i they come to room temperature
84-1_2347.07_2.92.wav_ASR	and then i have a special peanut butter that i use
84-1_2350.01_1.08.wav_ASR	you're gonna be a cop
84-1_2353.6_1.85.wav_ASR	well the peanut butter there is natural
84-1_2356.05_2.9.wav_ASR	well that's the peanut butter i buy
84-1_2359.35_3.68.wav_ASR	and i we have a few children that are around
84-1_2363.63_3.48.wav_ASR	so i would open the jar take some peanut butter
84-1_2367.83_2.504.wav_ASR	and then i would take different kinds of jelly
84-1_2370.434_9.058.wav_ASR	but right now i'm on a kick where i have blood blueberry strawberry and raspberry together in the mix
84-1_2380.014_1.86.wav_ASR	and i put that on the sandwich
84-1_2382.514_2.34.wav_ASR	then i close the sandwich
84-1_2385.454_3.553.wav_ASR	and you can either cut it in half or leave it whole
84-1_2389.007_2.9.wav_ASR	and for some stupid reason i always leave it home
84-1_2392.387_1.62.wav_ASR	and i had what was a nice salon
84-1_2394.347_5.34.wav_ASR	so i had that about one thirty for my two children
84-1_2413.71_5.31.wav_ASR	well firstnamew some i still try to do but i think my wife probably does more of it
84-1_2420.092_4.906.wav_ASR	oh i would choose what kind of temperament i would want it
84-1_2424.998_6.36.wav_ASR	but typically i would choose cold water because most of the stuff i need to watch is cold water
84-1_2431.958_3.042.wav_ASR	so i would in the special we have a machine
84-1_2435.278_2.14.wav_ASR	well we live in the park
84-1_2437.656_7.8.wav_ASR	we live in an area that useta be that we hafta buy the condo
84-1_2446.076_9.42.wav_ASR	but because we're getting ready to move next year we sold our condominium and we moved into a rental unit in the same building
84-1_2455.617_4.36.wav_ASR	so we would get the water out
84-1_2461.32_13.017.wav_ASR	well once the water is set it it it comes out on the side
84-1_2474.39_1.33.wav_ASR	so there's nothing on the top
84-1_2476.55_1.89.wav_ASR	so we hafta load the wash
84-1_2479.39_8.06.wav_ASR	and then we put the laundry detergent in it and started it
84-1_2487.48_6.74.wav_ASR	and you can see it from the we can see it from the
84-1_2495.135_8.325.wav_ASR	and not something that's it's easy to see from the floor
84-1_2504.52_2.52.wav_ASR	and so we put it on white
84-1_2507.302_4.58.wav_ASR	and it usually last for some reason for an hour and five minutes
84-1_2512.062_3.808.wav_ASR	but after an hour and five minutes the wash is done
84-1_2515.962_6.0.wav_ASR	if we have particular clothes that need to be put on the line
84-1_2522.162_4.18.wav_ASR	and the rest of it will go into the dryer where it would dry
84-1_2526.352_8.24.wav_ASR	and then it would be ready to be folded and put in the cupboard of drawers that we use for lunch
84-1_2535.332_2.932.wav_ASR	my wife has quite a few more than i do
84-1_2538.264_8.158.wav_ASR	but it's a place where we can put our stuff and use it as we need to
84-1_2557.42_3.87.wav_ASR	well you hafta understand that now i have it take me a while
84-1_2562.42_5.82.wav_ASR	so i usually get up in the morning
84-1_2568.47_8.6.wav_ASR	and i will put on my underwear
84-1_2578.86_3.09.wav_ASR	and then i would put on my
84-1_2583.37_2.06.wav_ASR	and i would put on my side
84-1_2586.38_6.68.wav_ASR	and then i would lie in bed for a little bit and do exercise because exercise is very important to me
84-1_2593.52_9.62.wav_ASR	especially even though i'm really more than three years ago it still important for me to to get some exercise and every day
84-1_2603.74_0.96.wav_ASR	so i do that
84-1_2604.776_5.64.wav_ASR	and then i will tip one on the tv
84-1_2610.876_6.2.wav_ASR	and i'll get dress the rest of my way which includes my socks
84-1_2617.536_4.7.wav_ASR	and you haven't seen this but i wear a brace on my right foot
84-1_2622.416_1.873.wav_ASR	so i put that on as well
84-1_2624.77_4.28.wav_ASR	and i i started my day
84-2_12.09_1.1.wav_ASR	my favorite holiday
84-2_13.79_9.28.wav_ASR	it's easy thanks because i have a very small family but usually the family comes as well as my two sons
84-2_24.03_1.468.wav_ASR	and now one of them's married
84-2_25.77_2.32.wav_ASR	what the and the other is gonna be married pretty soon
84-2_28.25_4.26.wav_ASR	so i look forward to a table with a few more people
84-2_32.564_2.32.wav_ASR	well i have two sisters
84-2_35.624_2.44.wav_ASR	one of them who is i think i told you in new york
84-2_38.244_1.46.wav_ASR	one of them will live in chicago
84-2_40.424_2.76.wav_ASR	so they typically come
84-2_43.573_14.028.wav_ASR	and for many many years i have told my stroke i was in charlotte which i do on a globe
84-2_58.053_1.58.wav_ASR	so it's really nice
84-2_60.413_2.52.wav_ASR	now i don't do it on the globe anymore
84-2_63.47_4.5.wav_ASR	and we don't hafta have a place at the shore but we don't have that anymore
84-2_68.71_4.28.wav_ASR	so i somebody else cooks it in the oven
84-2_78.94_7.65.wav_ASR	well i've been the host for thanksgiving since my mother died in ninety nine
84-2_86.96_1.04.wav_ASR	so it's been awhile
84-2_92.66_0.372.wav_ASR	it is
84-2_93.22_2.6.wav_ASR	it's nice but it doesn't last forever long
84-2_100.512_2.1.wav_ASR	we celebrated halloween
84-2_103.112_6.44.wav_ASR	and so we we don't even give permission anymore
84-2_109.668_11.36.wav_ASR	unfortunately both of the young ladies that my two sons married are both not judicious
84-2_121.788_3.708.wav_ASR	one of them i think has no relation which is fine with me
84-2_125.777_3.18.wav_ASR	and one of them i think is basilic
84-2_130.297_4.6.wav_ASR	but i think she likes cinderella is well
84-2_154.92_3.84.wav_ASR	my speech is probably the thing that i'm working on the most
84-2_159.16_7.84.wav_ASR	and as you know i useta be a lawyer and i've just gone back on accident
84-2_167.46_3.07.wav_ASR	so i can still be alive if i wanna be alive
84-2_171.22_15.68.wav_ASR	but i feel that a lot of times especially with small words and pronouns and nouns and right i'm not great with them
84-2_187.36_3.34.wav_ASR	so that that i hafta think for awhile
84-2_190.722_2.64.wav_ASR	absolutely now that firstnamel does not
84-2_193.622_1.4.wav_ASR	long ago all the driving
84-2_195.302_2.954.wav_ASR	well i hafta remember like which is left in which is right
84-2_198.782_1.54.wav_ASR	and i confesses me some time
84-2_200.742_3.33.wav_ASR	and i'm pretty good about barking at them forever
84-2_204.582_2.796.wav_ASR	and i'm hoping that i'll be able to drive at some point
84-2_207.378_8.784.wav_ASR	that's not a drive because i've always driven a lot but i've never been particularly interested in driving
84-2_216.44_9.7.wav_ASR	well i just do it because my wife and my two kids when they were around sometime they would drive by the
84-2_227.22_6.2.wav_ASR	but now since my stroke my wife does all the driving
84-2_234.05_6.33.wav_ASR	and as i think maybe in a year or so i may be in a year or so i may be able to start driving again
84-2_240.74_0.76.wav_ASR	and i'm not sure
84-2_247.16_2.58.wav_ASR	don't tell my wife that yes it's true
84-2_257.54_0.74.wav_ASR	yeah
84-2_263.0_2.98.wav_ASR	oh yeah i remember my stroke pretty well
84-2_273.18_11.211.wav_ASR	well i was in the hospital for about eight days before i went to firstnamej hospital which is also connected to firstnamej hospital
84-2_285.39_20.682.wav_ASR	and that's where in my area of town which is near firstnametown we go down into firstnamep which is probably around maybe ten blocks from here we go down to firstnamej which is probably around the same
84-2_306.65_15.44.wav_ASR	and i remember i remember you know i think i told you that on sunday morning i went out because there was a riot in minnesota
84-2_322.53_1.5.wav_ASR	well i forget his name right now
84-2_324.03_2.88.wav_ASR	so there's a huge ride
84-2_327.03_2.723.wav_ASR	we had a building actually burned here
84-2_330.29_4.617.wav_ASR	and i went out at about six o'clock in the morning to start climbing up
84-2_335.07_2.209.wav_ASR	and i was one of the few people out there
84-2_337.63_2.1.wav_ASR	and i remember they being a ten o'clock
84-2_339.843_5.105.wav_ASR	and so i was there about six o'clock in the morning
84-2_345.103_1.957.wav_ASR	and then i went to get a news paper
84-2_347.387_0.994.wav_ASR	it didn't feel great
84-2_348.683_2.769.wav_ASR	so i lie lay down for a little bit
84-2_351.763_2.48.wav_ASR	and then i went to work in the afterno
84-2_354.303_6.287.wav_ASR	and by the evening i was starting to feel a little worse but not terrible worst
84-2_361.05_2.15.wav_ASR	and i went to bed around ten thirty
84-2_364.003_2.577.wav_ASR	and i had my stroke in the middle of the night
84-2_367.183_3.063.wav_ASR	and in the morning my wife could not get a hold of me
84-2_370.723_2.645.wav_ASR	so we have a cousins who came up and found me
84-2_373.648_1.7.wav_ASR	and they took me to the hospital
84-2_375.668_2.58.wav_ASR	that's when i spent about eight days in hospital
84-2_378.928_4.34.wav_ASR	because because i was drowning
84-2_383.468_2.537.wav_ASR	so i really didn't see anybody there
84-2_386.828_5.56.wav_ASR	and i felt it was difficult for me because i felt my talking was not great
84-2_392.4_3.057.wav_ASR	and i also it was just difficult for me
84-2_395.58_4.82.wav_ASR	so it was i must have watched tv
84-2_400.74_2.02.wav_ASR	and it i was in a room by myself
84-2_402.991_12.52.wav_ASR	and eventually on a monday night the about a week later i went to mexico which is only about six blocks away
84-2_415.551_0.838.wav_ASR	it was pretty close
84-2_416.971_3.157.wav_ASR	so that's when i stayed for two months
84-2_430.74_2.047.wav_ASR	oh well i've done a lot of things to try to get better
84-2_433.0_1.662.wav_ASR	and i don't know if all of them work but
84-2_435.24_3.841.wav_ASR	so i was in the hospital for four weeks
84-2_439.239_9.64.wav_ASR	and every day except the weekend i had o t and p t and p t
84-2_449.599_1.36.wav_ASR	and then i also had speech
84-2_451.039_1.499.wav_ASR	that was typical in the morning
84-2_453.139_4.394.wav_ASR	and then in the afterno i for awhile i didn't do anything
84-2_457.533_3.458.wav_ASR	but then eventually i started going to art
84-2_461.433_4.9.wav_ASR	and i i did some stuff but it wasn't really good
84-2_467.093_6.865.wav_ASR	and i thought by the time i left there i wasn't so sure i was gonna do it
84-2_474.15_7.18.wav_ASR	so i tried it a little bit more at mexico which is where i go for outpatient
84-2_481.83_0.958.wav_ASR	and it wasn't great
84-2_483.11_2.78.wav_ASR	so they introduced a music program
84-2_486.65_2.184.wav_ASR	and i was always interested in singing
84-2_489.35_2.38.wav_ASR	but i don't sing a lot
84-2_491.79_3.961.wav_ASR	and i don't sing on key
84-2_496.23_1.816.wav_ASR	well i thought it might be good
84-2_498.25_2.78.wav_ASR	so i took some singing lessons which i still take
84-2_501.63_4.7.wav_ASR	and then off to temple there's an aphasia program
84-2_506.586_10.4.wav_ASR	and so there's a singing program there which i think better because i get real sounds at megabanks
84-2_517.118_19.5.wav_ASR	and i also am on somebody called firstnamep and see how we try to do stuff to help people learn about aphasia and see how we can help other people who have aphasia
84-2_563.78_6.71.wav_ASR	well i have a lot of good experiences because i've had a pretty positive life
84-2_570.49_11.14.wav_ASR	and i spent up until first grade i went to school in columbus delhi korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea korea
84-2_582.166_13.72.wav_ASR	and then before my first and second graders i moved to chicago and was in a really nice suburb there called firstnamek
84-2_596.144_6.909.wav_ASR	and so growing up i i i was practicing in a lot of different things
84-2_603.184_3.92.wav_ASR	but i was not a great athlete but i was an okay enough athlete
84-2_607.264_4.74.wav_ASR	so i usually make the last firstnamesp on the phone
84-2_612.29_4.45.wav_ASR	and i really like playing hockey which we did out doors at the time
84-2_617.81_12.14.wav_ASR	and so i would say i learned a lot of exercises from hockey just about the game and about to set up different places
84-2_630.86_17.583.wav_ASR	and eventually eventually when i was in my what's called firstnamemlex which is fourth and fifth i was made captain of the team
84-2_648.56_1.971.wav_ASR	that was a really nice auditorium for me
84-2_650.531_4.636.wav_ASR	and i was and it was a good time for me
84-2_655.371_2.836.wav_ASR	my i was not on the email i was not on the email
84-2_658.411_5.549.wav_ASR	but there's enough pliers on the beam that i was pretty familiar with
84-2_664.191_1.68.wav_ASR	and all of them were from firstnamew
84-2_666.031_2.66.wav_ASR	so it was when i was in north carolina
84-2_668.951_1.04.wav_ASR	it's in north carolina
84-2_670.145_2.671.wav_ASR	so it was really nice to meet all the people
84-2_673.365_10.54.wav_ASR	and we would have games based on lake forest and from lake country to look
84-2_684.865_2.36.wav_ASR	so it was just nice to get to know some people
84-2_693.81_2.2.wav_ASR	and i did get hurt at firstnamel
84-2_696.361_5.44.wav_ASR	and i broke my broken collarbone
84-2_706.07_1.072.wav_ASR	it wasn't that bad
84-2_710.85_1.037.wav_ASR	it it can be
84-2_712.13_2.397.wav_ASR	but it wasn't bad for me
84-2_714.67_2.22.wav_ASR	maybe it wasn't a particular bad
84-2_717.63_4.6.wav_ASR	but i came home and i still wasn't feeling great
84-2_722.231_11.86.wav_ASR	so my dad took me to what was now part of northwestern hospital which is now part of northwestern medical center
84-2_735.0_4.82.wav_ASR	and so i remember i did some exercises and some other things
84-2_740.071_1.66.wav_ASR	and they said i had a broken collarbone
84-2_741.98_7.66.wav_ASR	so i i think it you know i i think i i actually broke my collarbone
84-2_751.48_1.24.wav_ASR	maybe it was only once
84-2_753.1_1.699.wav_ASR	and then i also broke my wrist
84-2_755.56_1.969.wav_ASR	but i can't remember exactly how i did that
84-2_765.892_4.149.wav_ASR	yeah you you can't have a case on that
84-2_776.028_1.013.wav_ASR	okay
84-2_777.152_1.08.wav_ASR	you had it before
84-2_781.243_1.08.wav_ASR	oh well oh well
84-2_785.063_2.76.wav_ASR	and so did you do that in college too
84-2_797.763_0.72.wav_ASR	oh good
84-2_845.89_2.26.wav_ASR	oh yes that's the same thing we saw last week
84-2_858.01_2.94.wav_ASR	so it's the story of a young man
84-2_861.0_5.48.wav_ASR	we'll say he's around twelve years old kicking a soccer ball
84-2_867.26_13.14.wav_ASR	and i guess one of the airfixes went through a plate glass window and landed next to someone who was probably either watching tv
84-2_880.69_3.33.wav_ASR	and so he saw the ball coming at him
84-2_884.43_10.34.wav_ASR	and he knows that a lamp had come to rescue him
84-2_895.09_3.248.wav_ASR	and i could see the ball coming at him
84-2_898.338_2.865.wav_ASR	so he might have caught the ball
84-2_902.03_2.001.wav_ASR	and and he wasn't sure what to do
84-2_904.138_2.02.wav_ASR	so he saw that the glass is broken
84-2_906.678_4.26.wav_ASR	so he went over to the window to see what had happened
84-2_911.418_4.592.wav_ASR	and i'm assuming that he saw the person who kicked the soccer ball
84-2_916.01_6.4.wav_ASR	but then perhaps but by then the person with the soccer ball had run away
84-2_930.177_7.24.wav_ASR	so it's the story of a young boy who was on his way to school
84-2_938.237_5.22.wav_ASR	and he wasn't sure that he needed an umbrella
84-2_943.61_7.119.wav_ASR	so he didn't take an umbrella because it maybe didn't look like it was gonna rain
84-2_951.25_5.94.wav_ASR	but as soon as she stepped outside and started walking a little bit the rain came down
84-2_957.89_1.84.wav_ASR	so he went back to his house
84-2_959.73_4.444.wav_ASR	and i he was all wet
84-2_964.39_3.26.wav_ASR	and his mother had a son on his face
84-2_967.95_1.755.wav_ASR	but there was nothing he could do
84-2_969.89_4.927.wav_ASR	so he got some news and went back out into the rain
84-2_975.35_1.92.wav_ASR	well this time he had an umbrella
84-2_988.79_6.25.wav_ASR	this is the picture of a young lady who had a cat stuck up in a tree
84-2_995.279_8.66.wav_ASR	so he got off his tricycle and saw i think what must have been his dad
84-2_1004.61_2.312.wav_ASR	his dad climbed up the tree
84-2_1007.139_3.56.wav_ASR	then the ladder broke and fell to the ground
84-2_1011.04_7.14.wav_ASR	there is a a pup who's trying to see if maybe the man or could come down
84-2_1018.34_18.709.wav_ASR	but she he was up there and needed to be rescued by the fire department who came over and passed i imagine also get the hospital down
84-2_1188.82_0.522.wav_ASR	got you
84-2_1190.29_11.04.wav_ASR	well so this story about cinderella and her two old stepdaughters and her old
84-2_1202.87_5.93.wav_ASR	so i leave that cinderella needed some help
84-2_1208.85_10.08.wav_ASR	and since she was able to get a job with the two stepsisters and the stepmother
84-2_1219.6_12.86.wav_ASR	and she was doing a lot of stuff like washing the clothes and cleaning the floors and doing stuff like that and probably also doing the laundry
84-2_1233.61_13.66.wav_ASR	and then it came to pass that there was a prince who lived in the castle with his father and firstnamesb and princess
84-2_1247.87_7.51.wav_ASR	and he he was looking for somebody to fall in love with
84-2_1255.91_10.09.wav_ASR	so they everybody in the town got an invitation to this big party that they were gonna have
84-2_1266.0_7.976.wav_ASR	so the two step sisters dress up in fine clothes and the mother went with them
84-2_1273.976_12.38.wav_ASR	and they were they went to the the prince the king was looking for
84-2_1286.996_3.0.wav_ASR	and so she decided to have this party
84-2_1290.119_5.02.wav_ASR	and so they were at the party
84-2_1295.299_12.78.wav_ASR	and then a fairy godmother came along and said to the young woman cinderella that cinderella should go to the party too
84-2_1308.226_9.88.wav_ASR	so she she was able to get a dress and some nice clothes
84-2_1319.006_8.0.wav_ASR	and they were invited to the wedding
84-2_1327.231_10.9.wav_ASR	and they came to the wedding and a celebration firstnamesc and i think of someone who was in the back
84-2_1338.211_7.36.wav_ASR	and they came out at the at the party
84-2_1345.673_6.279.wav_ASR	and the the prince was there
84-2_1352.133_2.54.wav_ASR	and the prince saw cinderella
84-2_1355.293_3.02.wav_ASR	and they had a very good time
84-2_1358.335_10.88.wav_ASR	but the prince had the cinderella had been told that she needed to be home by midnight
84-2_1370.035_5.014.wav_ASR	so as the clock struck twelve she knew she hadta get out
84-2_1375.049_3.707.wav_ASR	so he left and left the prince there
84-2_1378.756_17.48.wav_ASR	and as he went out to the circle cinderella turned back into a like a servant
84-2_1396.299_11.02.wav_ASR	and the prince prince was really upset about what had happened
84-2_1407.593_17.28.wav_ASR	so he he sent some people from his college to go out and see if they could find
84-2_1425.678_6.62.wav_ASR	and so she went to different houses and could not find anybody
84-2_1432.618_11.82.wav_ASR	when he went to the house where the two stepsisters lived she was wanting to know if anybody else was there
84-2_1444.93_13.02.wav_ASR	and somehow i think maybe he figured out that the young lady who was cinderella was in the other room
84-2_1458.25_1.72.wav_ASR	so he brought out cinderella
84-2_1460.57_2.92.wav_ASR	and the shoes fit
84-2_1463.42_8.56.wav_ASR	so he went back to the prince and told him about this person
84-2_1472.66_6.16.wav_ASR	and eventually the person became close again with the prince
84-2_1480.57_3.74.wav_ASR	and and in the end the prince and cinderella got married
84-2_1514.01_3.94.wav_ASR	and i don't remember what i talked about last week
84-2_1518.63_6.689.wav_ASR	so there was always a clock in my house growing up
84-2_1526.11_3.865.wav_ASR	and so i i knew pretty easily what time it was
84-2_1530.23_1.698.wav_ASR	oh i think i know the story
84-2_1531.9_8.72.wav_ASR	and so i remember specifically in the hospital that there wasn't really any time i hadta be home
84-2_1541.12_5.3.wav_ASR	so my parents said that you know when you get home is fine
84-2_1546.84_4.825.wav_ASR	you know obviously not too late but you you wanna have a good time
84-2_1551.665_5.02.wav_ASR	so especially on friday and saturday nights we useta go out when we
84-2_1556.735_4.043.wav_ASR	you useta drink beer and then go out
84-2_1561.105_4.17.wav_ASR	and so we would go to different parties which was a lot fun
84-2_1565.275_7.34.wav_ASR	but i always made it home except one time i actually fell asleep at the wheel
84-2_1573.075_7.54.wav_ASR	but i was driving
84-2_1580.922_5.48.wav_ASR	 somebody else named one of my friends who was named firstnameb was in the other
84-2_1587.065_3.064.wav_ASR	and he he yelled at me
84-2_1590.202_0.83.wav_ASR	and i woke up
84-2_1591.802_1.28.wav_ASR	well and it was in a stop
84-2_1593.302_0.94.wav_ASR	so nothing happened
84-2_1594.562_1.16.wav_ASR	and i was pretty lucky
84-2_1595.743_6.552.wav_ASR	so i guess it it's just good to know that a clock is also there now time it is
84-2_1602.295_18.18.wav_ASR	and then when i was in college i used to i did a couple different girls where i was from in in north carolina and
84-2_1621.213_5.323.wav_ASR	and so i had a job that started at six o'clock in the morning during the summer
84-2_1626.636_8.781.wav_ASR	so i useta stay out with my friends at my girls' house until about four in the morning and then go to work
84-2_1635.473_3.123.wav_ASR	or i'll come home and get my bike and then go to work
84-2_1638.596_3.3.wav_ASR	so it was fun but it was also pretty exhausting
84-2_1661.747_12.78.wav_ASR	and i think the only thing i can say about birds
84-2_1674.744_11.46.wav_ASR	and i remember even when i was in university i i mean i never thought about birds
84-2_1686.85_16.941.wav_ASR	but as i as i worked to get well i i guess that i worked a lot in when i was in when i was a lawyer
84-2_1703.791_4.937.wav_ASR	and then i went to a computer where i was for a long time
84-2_1709.271_8.12.wav_ASR	but now that i'm looking for stuff i'm pretty interested in doing one of the things i'm doing is birdwatching
84-2_1718.071_2.377.wav_ASR	so it's something i'm gonna try to do
84-2_1720.448_13.26.wav_ASR	and i i'm sure i told you but maybe i didn't that my that me and my my wife are gonna move to south carolina and in a community there where i feel i can do better work
84-2_1734.128_1.611.wav_ASR	so i like to try it
84-2_1735.948_1.252.wav_ASR	and i hope i'm good at it
84-2_1737.348_1.265.wav_ASR	and i hope i know what i'm doing
84-2_1738.613_8.402.wav_ASR	but it's important for me to find some hobbies that i can work on and try to get feel good about it
84-2_1751.233_2.428.wav_ASR	oh we've already picked the place
84-2_1753.973_1.755.wav_ASR	and you call firstnamew
84-2_1755.813_0.848.wav_ASR	you never been there
84-2_1757.804_3.6.wav_ASR	and it's off the coast of
84-2_1763.495_4.149.wav_ASR	about forty minutes from the firstnamer arizona
84-2_1768.604_1.36.wav_ASR	and it's a beautiful
84-2_1772.244_3.34.wav_ASR	well i don't wanna go to too much detail
84-2_1775.781_12.445.wav_ASR	but we we're correcting a place there that part of a cinderella that right on the beach
84-2_1788.901_5.343.wav_ASR	and so i my wife is down there right now
84-2_1794.244_5.8.wav_ASR	well and she could actually go into the building which is being conscious
84-2_1800.532_16.3.wav_ASR	and she was able to tell me that from my from where our mind is place my wife says that she can actually see the speech you know for the obsession
84-2_1817.192_13.006.wav_ASR	so for me that was really nice because i used my i useta have a place in oxford memorial which my wife really liked so much of it
84-2_1830.198_1.1.wav_ASR	it was the last on the water
84-2_1831.912_4.94.wav_ASR	and so now i feel that i've been able to give something you know
84-2_1837.124_5.433.wav_ASR	so i wanna find a place that would be good for her
84-2_1843.004_3.038.wav_ASR	and i mean it's gonna be a little hot for me
84-2_1846.364_6.04.wav_ASR	but i think it's gonna be worth it because it's gonna be great places for my wife
84-2_1861.804_4.88.wav_ASR	it's in south carolina or north carolina
84-2_1868.964_0.303.wav_ASR	wait a minute
84-2_1877.712_1.04.wav_ASR	well it's pretty curious
84-2_1879.112_1.64.wav_ASR	and i'm not very concerned so
84-2_1882.912_1.763.wav_ASR	it's i think it should be good
84-2_1885.012_4.164.wav_ASR	and we know some people down there who live there
84-2_1889.212_1.86.wav_ASR	so that's gonna be really helpful for two
84-2_1891.217_9.274.wav_ASR	but the person i know really well made a fortune and in a company that he was in
84-2_1900.657_4.7.wav_ASR	so he has a lot of places now all over the world involved in korea
84-2_1929.085_7.92.wav_ASR	well probably the hotel i stayed in some nice hotel
84-2_1937.925_5.3.wav_ASR	but probably the nicest hotel i stayed in was for my wedding
84-2_1943.216_11.64.wav_ASR	and i married a a law student when i was in college who lived in washington dc
84-2_1955.736_3.62.wav_ASR	so we got married at the four seasons hotel in jackson
84-2_1960.256_1.29.wav_ASR	and that was a real nice place
84-2_1961.546_2.702.wav_ASR	we we were able to be there for couple days
84-2_1964.566_2.56.wav_ASR	we had a fireman at our wedding
84-2_1967.137_1.529.wav_ASR	think it was about two hundred
84-2_1969.686_5.86.wav_ASR	and we were able to have a wedding on a sunday after
84-2_1976.586_2.56.wav_ASR	and we had a nice lunch
84-2_1979.209_12.504.wav_ASR	and then i remember that many of my friends went down to a bar firstnamedj and firstnamesj had a nice evening there
84-2_1992.089_1.731.wav_ASR	so for me it was a good place
84-2_1994.369_2.18.wav_ASR	but trouble i like being home
84-2_1996.549_3.359.wav_ASR	so i you know i did it
84-2_1999.989_0.545.wav_ASR	it was good
84-2_2000.709_3.348.wav_ASR	you know i like being where i am now
84-2_2196.154_4.351.wav_ASR	well i think i told you about my favorite restaurant in new york city
84-2_2200.505_1.925.wav_ASR	one that i went to for about twenty years
84-2_2204.4_1.8.wav_ASR	oh i won't talk about that
84-2_2206.653_12.64.wav_ASR	well here in philadelphia i've got to know a few restaurants
84-2_2219.853_5.936.wav_ASR	because i lived here when i first took a job
84-2_2225.789_3.92.wav_ASR	and i was a law school for a judge and firstnamee
84-2_2230.669_3.36.wav_ASR	and then i lived here for awhile i moved to phoenix
84-2_2234.197_14.716.wav_ASR	but one of the places i like to eat a lot all of it is gone in princeton which is how usable part in franklin
84-2_2249.537_1.139.wav_ASR	and i don't know if i told
84-2_2250.676_4.494.wav_ASR	but i useta be able to speak pretty well
84-2_2255.756_5.814.wav_ASR	and i like going there because they have a lot of good food
84-2_2262.196_5.2.wav_ASR	most of which is again two it's got to be over price like so many restaurants
84-2_2267.49_9.604.wav_ASR	but one thing i really like there is my my my husband that's really nice
84-2_2277.79_5.42.wav_ASR	and it can be cook different ways
84-2_2283.415_9.06.wav_ASR	and i like my meat very well not cook not cook most of the way
84-2_2293.155_8.88.wav_ASR	and it's a really nice place to get a jesus burger and either a salad or something
84-2_2302.33_4.163.wav_ASR	if if the friends are usually for my wife
84-2_2307.01_2.4.wav_ASR	so i usually find out getting a c t
84-2_2309.77_7.26.wav_ASR	but sometimes she makes me order the the the
84-2_2336.29_0.91.wav_ASR	oh we had this two
84-2_2337.64_6.1.wav_ASR	well the peanut butter and jelly sandwich for me is pretty easy to make
84-2_2344.78_4.14.wav_ASR	you go to the most of my bread is in the freezer
84-2_2349.56_2.46.wav_ASR	so i take out two pieces of bread
84-2_2352.03_13.906.wav_ASR	well i like a particular kind of peanut butter that is made at cosco which has nothing but peanut butter
84-2_2365.936_10.164.wav_ASR	and so i usually put when i have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich with later only for some reason i don't know
84-2_2376.676_2.695.wav_ASR	and then i'll take just about any jelly
84-2_2379.371_10.336.wav_ASR	but i've found a jelly at i think at firstnamesj that has three different types of fruit it
84-2_2389.5_27.09.wav_ASR	and so i put that with the peanut butter on a bread bread that i find to be very good
84-2_2416.69_4.042.wav_ASR	so i i'm gonna have a sandwich a little later today
84-2_2420.83_1.92.wav_ASR	and i'm probably gonna have a turkey sandwich
84-2_2423.13_2.155.wav_ASR	but yeah i like peanut butter and jelly al
84-2_2425.63_8.46.wav_ASR	and i've got the i've got the c t now to a sinuses
84-2_2440.382_15.965.wav_ASR	well we i think i may have told you that we useta live in the apartment that we owned across the hall
84-2_2456.416_4.325.wav_ASR	but we thought we could sell it to
84-2_2460.976_7.3.wav_ASR	and it turned out that the two of them bought it at a price that i think was pretty good
84-2_2468.485_11.2.wav_ASR	so while we were waiting for the place to be built in kewahui we moved it turned out across the hall where there's a rental unit
84-2_2479.5_13.0.wav_ASR	and so and there's a washer and a dryer with all the all the all the all the
84-2_2493.08_0.68.wav_ASR	the rooms
84-2_2494.18_4.5.wav_ASR	all the observations i guess you could say have a washer in a dryer
84-2_2499.03_7.61.wav_ASR	so usually there may be a couple people that may go to the wheelchair
84-2_2506.81_8.7.wav_ASR	but for the most part i will open the
84-2_2516.541_5.6.wav_ASR	it's a washer that works it it opens from the side
84-2_2522.721_4.203.wav_ASR	so i've put all a close together which is something i'm still able to do
84-2_2527.541_5.5.wav_ASR	and then i will turn on the wash
84-2_2533.721_1.86.wav_ASR	usually it's on a cold side
84-2_2535.923_4.6.wav_ASR	and once it starts moving a little bit i put in the detergent
84-2_2541.603_5.972.wav_ASR	and for some reason this this washer takes a long time
84-2_2548.263_2.18.wav_ASR	but in about an hour it's done
84-2_2550.963_2.58.wav_ASR	and the clothes have always come out pretty clean
84-2_2553.677_3.5.wav_ASR	so i then put them in the dryer
84-2_2558.157_3.06.wav_ASR	and that's about another forty five minutes
84-2_2561.777_10.454.wav_ASR	but usually with in two hours the clothes come out and they're ready to be folded which for me take a half an hour because i only have one at hand
84-2_2572.231_6.68.wav_ASR	and so what i've tried to do is just limit the stuff that i like the stuff that goes in my closet
84-2_2579.691_1.311.wav_ASR	and her own
84-2_2582.091_6.46.wav_ASR	yes she her clothes get washed with mine but i can't really put them away
84-2_2588.911_1.977.wav_ASR	and she's got a lot more clothing than i do
84-2_2605.921_5.7.wav_ASR	well i i grew up with a lot of flu
84-2_2612.441_6.897.wav_ASR	but somehow when i married firstnamel that was not one of the things that she was really interested in
84-2_2619.338_7.26.wav_ASR	so we have a few not a lot of facts around our apartment
84-2_2627.098_3.1.wav_ASR	but i had a birthday in march
84-2_2630.778_6.74.wav_ASR	and one of the people i've become very close with is a personal trainer named firstnamej
84-2_2637.618_7.84.wav_ASR	and so firstnamej has been with me for about two and a half years
84-2_2645.678_7.36.wav_ASR	and she got a small plant for me that is the only living plant in this apartment
84-2_2654.178_0.9.wav_ASR	and for some reason
84-2_2655.359_3.54.wav_ASR	and i got it at the end of
84-2_2661.499_3.353.wav_ASR	and for some reason the pound is still chuckling along
84-2_2664.959_0.989.wav_ASR	it's doing pretty well
84-2_2666.159_8.647.wav_ASR	so i feel good that i can keep a plant now for four months
84-2_2681.403_5.463.wav_ASR	and i think the biggest issue is that i don't hafta water it very often
84-2_2689.146_3.773.wav_ASR	but i can show it to you but i don't know what it is
84-2_2692.919_6.577.wav_ASR	maybe at the end if we have enough time i can see it
84-2_2699.679_5.76.wav_ASR	but it it it just hard for me to see because of the wind over there

63-1_316.275_1.26.wav_ASR	so he went out without it
63-1_318.802_1.81.wav_ASR	and he got soaked wet
63-1_321.731_2.41.wav_ASR	and so he went back
63-1_324.164_4.18.wav_ASR	and his mother was really mad
63-1_328.364_3.0.wav_ASR	and and so he took the umbrella
63-1_333.482_4.93.wav_ASR	and then when he got home he gave it to his mother
63-1_360.885_0.43.wav_ASR	okay
63-1_361.333_5.35.wav_ASR	you know do you just tell me right now
63-1_371.077_0.39.wav_ASR	oh okay
63-1_371.488_1.82.wav_ASR	and i'm remarried
63-1_373.954_9.02.wav_ASR	there's there's a ladder on the ground
63-1_382.989_5.11.wav_ASR	and and it was useta catch a cat
63-1_388.361_1.55.wav_ASR	but it was on the
63-1_390.248_1.3.wav_ASR	so i did
63-1_392.33_9.53.wav_ASR	and i needed to take the dog up to the boy so he could get it
63-1_402.248_11.88.wav_ASR	and he he couldn't get up because the dog was growling on
63-1_414.71_2.09.wav_ASR	so i got some fire
63-1_416.822_3.82.wav_ASR	and and he he got up there
63-1_421.431_4.55.wav_ASR	and on the way to the ground he saw cinderella
63-1_425.998_2.87.wav_ASR	and and
63-1_965.553_24.44.wav_ASR	firstnamec cinderella was introduced by her two or three stepsisters and her mother and
63-1_990.015_24.73.wav_ASR	and they she couldn't go to the go to the
63-1_1017.014_15.52.wav_ASR	but cinderella had a fairy godmother who got her all dressed up and sent her to the ball
63-1_1032.558_7.14.wav_ASR	and at midnight she
63-1_1043.301_2.52.wav_ASR	and she lost her slipper
63-1_1045.915_8.16.wav_ASR	and so everyone was wondering about it
63-1_1055.11_1.24.wav_ASR	it was really hard
63-1_1056.449_6.94.wav_ASR	and then the call came and said he had the other sl
63-1_1063.516_1.95.wav_ASR	and he took it from
63-1_1065.485_2.85.wav_ASR	and it was her slipper
63-1_1069.277_5.73.wav_ASR	and so cinderella and the prince lived happily ever after
63-1_1076.923_0.77.wav_ASR	so i'm not like
63-1_1089.922_3.5.wav_ASR	and i get
63-1_1094.826_14.33.wav_ASR	and i put jelly on one slice and peanut butter on the other
63-1_1109.178_2.18.wav_ASR	and i put it together and i put it together
63-2_8.939_3.81.wav_ASR	my speech is okay
63-2_12.805_5.82.wav_ASR	but a lot of times i i know what it is but i can't say
63-2_20.929_0.67.wav_ASR	that's what it is
63-2_21.647_1.36.wav_ASR	but i know what it is
63-2_23.054_4.5.wav_ASR	and until someone told me what it is i just can't say it
63-2_27.999_0.71.wav_ASR	well i don't know why
63-2_28.733_2.26.wav_ASR	it's the way it is now
63-2_38.859_0.35.wav_ASR	yeah
63-2_44.303_3.08.wav_ASR	well i got up in the morning
63-2_48.081_2.82.wav_ASR	and right away i i i i rolled over
63-2_51.772_2.14.wav_ASR	and she she was by my side
63-2_54.63_3.83.wav_ASR	and i told her i felt a little squeezy
63-2_59.076_3.32.wav_ASR	and firstnamese's name is firstnameb
63-2_62.957_13.02.wav_ASR	so then i went to the bathroom and did my thing
63-2_76.575_5.33.wav_ASR	and then right after i did my thing something happened in here
63-2_83.156_2.36.wav_ASR	and i said
63-2_86.28_0.56.wav_ASR	oh no
63-2_87.247_4.1.wav_ASR	and that's the last thing i remember for weeks
63-2_110.622_8.52.wav_ASR	well the last thing i knew before my stroke was
63-2_119.546_6.29.wav_ASR	well after my stroke hit i i woke up
63-2_125.884_5.95.wav_ASR	and i remember this was an ambulance emergency room
63-2_131.943_3.96.wav_ASR	so the next thing i know i'm back in wichita
63-2_137.638_4.23.wav_ASR	and on a bed
63-2_141.886_3.02.wav_ASR	my wife there
63-2_145.895_8.26.wav_ASR	and and i i slowly started talking to her
63-2_154.83_6.86.wav_ASR	but i don't think i at at the first thing i don't think i made much sense to it
63-2_161.771_2.36.wav_ASR	but she was always there for me
63-2_166.318_5.94.wav_ASR	so it it was okay because i i could tell her anything i wanted
63-2_172.567_0.74.wav_ASR	and she missed
63-2_174.287_2.43.wav_ASR	dead or whatever she could
63-2_179.54_8.31.wav_ASR	and then after awhile two or three nurses would come in every day
63-2_187.899_9.62.wav_ASR	and and the they would do crazy things like live my legs and lift my back
63-2_197.735_3.12.wav_ASR	and every day is something different
63-2_200.878_1.4.wav_ASR	and i would go down the hall
63-2_203.68_13.15.wav_ASR	and they would do leg lifts trying to get me whatever
63-2_216.852_3.61.wav_ASR	and i i would do strokes
63-2_220.72_2.27.wav_ASR	well i remember that i did therapy
63-2_223.735_6.54.wav_ASR	did a lot of i don't know
63-2_231.307_0.98.wav_ASR	and then i don't know
63-2_232.337_1.88.wav_ASR	that they're always somebody there
63-2_234.266_4.36.wav_ASR	and there was always always somebody doing something to me
63-2_238.866_2.82.wav_ASR	lot of it i don't know anymore
63-2_241.734_6.07.wav_ASR	but it was very for the first couple weeks i was very exhausted
63-2_270.707_16.25.wav_ASR	well the the best thing i can remember before my stroke was getting married of course
63-2_287.802_2.96.wav_ASR	and i was in the surgery at the time
63-2_290.815_10.36.wav_ASR	we we before my before i was also in the air force for twenty two years
63-2_302.963_14.46.wav_ASR	so other from that i think the thing that i do the most about is in houston georgia
63-2_318.711_10.5.wav_ASR	oh i i was very interested in boston and firstnamebuck
63-2_330.401_3.01.wav_ASR	had a lot of good memories about football
63-2_335.59_16.4.wav_ASR	yeah i i was not alone my own horse but after the cinderella finally on the tree
63-2_352.759_1.93.wav_ASR	at a lot of insurance
63-2_356.795_1.32.wav_ASR	well a lot of things happened
63-2_358.702_5.14.wav_ASR	but there's a lot of things
63-2_363.887_3.23.wav_ASR	well there's so much
63-2_367.253_10.28.wav_ASR	you know there's some many things good and bad that happened to me
63-2_377.551_2.11.wav_ASR	and i i can't do any of them
63-2_379.803_3.54.wav_ASR	the fact that a lot of my don't even remember anymore
63-2_384.569_2.54.wav_ASR	they're either retired or whatever
63-2_387.736_1.31.wav_ASR	that that that's the way it
63-2_411.303_0.58.wav_ASR	okay
63-2_413.03_4.45.wav_ASR	there there was a boy who kicked the ball
63-2_417.912_3.64.wav_ASR	and the ball went into a glass window
63-2_422.674_15.1.wav_ASR	and when it went into the window and it hit the guy on the stairs and knocked over the lamp
63-2_438.726_2.45.wav_ASR	and so she grabbed the lamp
63-2_442.108_7.4.wav_ASR	and he he wasn't getting it back to the lamp was fixed
63-2_481.005_0.36.wav_ASR	okay
63-2_481.732_8.03.wav_ASR	first of all the boy did not want to take an umbrella
63-2_491.361_5.2.wav_ASR	he he said it was okay that she didn't have it
63-2_497.241_6.7.wav_ASR	so he he walked out in the rain and saw it was raining
63-2_504.464_2.37.wav_ASR	so she hadta go back home
63-2_508.083_4.21.wav_ASR	and he was all wet now
63-2_512.317_9.689.wav_ASR	and so she hadta get her umbrella
63-2_522.629_3.17.wav_ASR	and she put it and her hand
63-2_525.853_3.21.wav_ASR	and he went to school
63-2_544.992_0.48.wav_ASR	okay
63-2_557.835_3.71.wav_ASR	first of all i see a little girl
63-2_561.562_1.48.wav_ASR	and she's trying to get a
63-2_564.448_3.49.wav_ASR	but her her her ladder
63-2_568.152_0.97.wav_ASR	so she couldn't get it
63-2_569.138_10.13.wav_ASR	so she went to her father who couldn't get it either because the the ladder was gone
63-2_579.979_9.18.wav_ASR	and he had a dog
63-2_589.176_4.92.wav_ASR	and the and had it
63-2_594.116_4.12.wav_ASR	cook and the up up up up up up up up up up
63-2_599.141_4.71.wav_ASR	and so because she couldn't
63-2_603.984_1.24.wav_ASR	you know she couldn't get the cat
63-2_606.497_1.25.wav_ASR	couldn't get the dog
63-2_608.377_9.35.wav_ASR	and she went with the fireman who got her out and got everything back to normal
63-2_1440.511_0.74.wav_ASR	okay
63-2_1441.268_16.0.wav_ASR	when the grandmother and their two grandchildren were small they brought in cinderella to clean up the house
63-2_1458.806_6.78.wav_ASR	and cinderella did all the work
63-2_1466.686_10.03.wav_ASR	and as kids got older there were more things for cinderella to do
63-2_1478.756_14.77.wav_ASR	and finally they got an invitation from the prince that there was gonna be a gal at the princess palace
63-2_1495.182_6.21.wav_ASR	and they they told her she couldn't go because she wasn't invited
63-2_1501.414_1.13.wav_ASR	you know the only lady was
63-2_1503.72_13.93.wav_ASR	so after they were gone and and showed them how she could do
63-2_1518.63_15.49.wav_ASR	and so the first thing the fairy godmother did was turned all the mice and the horses and the horses and the horses and the car and the carriage and the horses and the car and the carriage and the horses and the
63-2_1535.312_12.67.wav_ASR	and then cinderella was given a fine dress to wear
63-2_1549.523_20.5.wav_ASR	and then when she got to the ball the only thing was cinderella the prince could see nothing but cinderella
63-2_1571.01_3.63.wav_ASR	and they danced the night away
63-2_1575.707_4.89.wav_ASR	and then it twelve o'clock she said she hadta
63-2_1580.617_5.67.wav_ASR	well and while she was going one of her slippers was left on the ground
63-2_1586.306_15.28.wav_ASR	and so when she got home cinderella was back on her and her her shoes and dresses and everything
63-2_1601.634_26.69.wav_ASR	and then the the shoe well was supposed to be broken by the the evil mother
63-2_1629.078_3.66.wav_ASR	but they it it was
63-2_1632.753_6.42.wav_ASR	and so cinderella put on a shoe
63-2_1639.194_4.61.wav_ASR	shoe and it was exact match the other other other other
63-2_1644.445_0.98.wav_ASR	so she knew it
63-2_1646.792_3.37.wav_ASR	and so her prince got married
63-2_1650.177_1.77.wav_ASR	and they lived happily ever after
63-2_1666.397_8.74.wav_ASR	you put two slices of bread together
63-2_1675.69_2.37.wav_ASR	one with peanut butter one with jelly
63-2_1678.161_2.74.wav_ASR	and you get them together and you get them together
63-2_1680.917_3.87.wav_ASR	you got a peanut butter jelly sandwich
65-1_9.517_0.96.wav_ASR	seems to be accidental
65-1_28.81_2.53.wav_ASR	the eighty firstnamel last time last year
65-1_35.471_0.49.wav_ASR	oh jeez
65-1_36.531_2.9.wav_ASR	they happen on a thursday march the third or fourth
65-1_40.334_5.76.wav_ASR	well remember we're at some friends' house having supper the previous night
65-1_46.238_15.54.wav_ASR	and i remember nothing after that until at least three days after i moved out of michu and told the firstnamer about three days after i moved out of michu
65-1_63.223_3.95.wav_ASR	and the eighteen ninety nine
65-1_67.496_0.83.wav_ASR	and i see the
65-1_69.041_4.34.wav_ASR	it was crossing firstnamee in anaphora
65-1_74.421_2.67.wav_ASR	and i remember crossing in the hospital crossroads
65-1_77.109_7.56.wav_ASR	crossing with the left and she and getting up close to the corner pal on the car going from west east
65-1_86.021_1.74.wav_ASR	and then at the end of the speech they sound around
65-1_87.783_6.82.wav_ASR	and that last i remember thinking from last summer of probably twenty twenty months ago
65-1_104.608_1.57.wav_ASR	one two three four five six seven eight nine ten one one one two three four five six seven eight nine
65-1_107.092_0.66.wav_ASR	one two three four five six seven eight nine ten one one one two three four five six
65-1_107.8_10.32.wav_ASR	that was really trouble because really drooping because really drooping because didn't know where i was
65-1_119.162_6.17.wav_ASR	and there were visitors in the hospital room in my hospital room
65-1_125.543_3.84.wav_ASR	and these guys were saying
65-1_129.431_3.17.wav_ASR	and i knew who they were new new people
65-1_132.616_1.52.wav_ASR	but there's a lot lost of them
65-1_134.184_1.5.wav_ASR	they didn't know where i was
65-1_136.291_2.12.wav_ASR	there're lots of people visiting me
65-1_138.802_1.63.wav_ASR	and and the second lastnamem

65-1_148.727_11.07.wav_ASR	and but what i didn't know was at the end of my stroke and a coma
65-1_160.403_2.47.wav_ASR	and and look like it was gonna come out again
65-1_162.888_1.7.wav_ASR	and they gave me a tricycle
65-1_165.547_13.33.wav_ASR	and and so the the what turned out to be sarah and firstnamer where my wife hadta told me
65-1_178.901_7.83.wav_ASR	and she said that you you had the date
65-1_190.21_0.31.wav_ASR	well firstnamesu

65-1_193.584_0.55.wav_ASR	and that was gone
65-1_194.184_7.67.wav_ASR	but that was the story because i i didn't know where i was
65-1_202.556_3.45.wav_ASR	when people are really nice it's really nice
65-1_206.835_1.36.wav_ASR	when it was when the firstnamew came back

65-1_326.232_3.43.wav_ASR	it was like just a re run but not near as severe
65-1_330.55_12.55.wav_ASR	but the eighty four years ago because and in january for my my my come by

65-1_357.802_6.2.wav_ASR	to tell me i was on the hospital list which meant my i was going in
65-1_364.136_1.18.wav_ASR	my career is laid out front of me
65-1_366.048_2.15.wav_ASR	and there was nothing shocking me
65-1_369.12_8.58.wav_ASR	and then after the eight or eleven o'clock i find out twenty firstnamem firstnamep
65-1_377.717_1.63.wav_ASR	who would i find at twenty years ago in denise
65-1_380.151_3.17.wav_ASR	and the cinderella
65-1_384.141_2.67.wav_ASR	oh i was slow to comprehend things
65-1_387.869_5.87.wav_ASR	but finally did after taking more time for comparison
65-1_393.757_7.06.wav_ASR	and and i couldn't do my engineering job to to suit me
65-1_401.669_1.51.wav_ASR	and i didn't tell anybody that
65-1_403.668_0.89.wav_ASR	and i didn't know anybody
65-1_404.612_0.8.wav_ASR	alright i faked it
65-1_406.295_17.87.wav_ASR	and firstnamem for months by myself and a couple hours for my job and not telling a school because i just knew
65-1_424.226_1.26.wav_ASR	that's before firstnamer
65-1_426.413_1.47.wav_ASR	and ninety nine hundred and a half
65-1_428.188_2.09.wav_ASR	actually before the emergencies of disabiliti
65-1_430.428_0.54.wav_ASR	firstnamee
65-1_432.046_2.46.wav_ASR	and and i was on at the accident nearest
65-1_434.528_1.11.wav_ASR	well i don't communicate
65-1_436.8_5.82.wav_ASR	and i i just knew that not be able to communicate my job
65-1_443.288_1.95.wav_ASR	actually i just knew i was gonna get fired
65-1_445.562_0.85.wav_ASR	and i knew i was
65-1_447.165_8.14.wav_ASR	at three kids a wife is just a lovely lovely lovely little woman there at home with three kids
65-1_455.32_2.19.wav_ASR	and i was the firstnamer
65-1_458.431_2.45.wav_ASR	and i couldn't stand on top of it
65-1_461.855_5.49.wav_ASR	and and so i'd say it every day i couldn't do anything i coulda done my job
65-1_467.981_7.74.wav_ASR	and took me probably couple three years ago that that i was no longer on the fast track
65-1_476.146_1.08.wav_ASR	and no no no
65-1_477.247_2.36.wav_ASR	you know it wasn't was not obvious
65-1_479.684_3.22.wav_ASR	but i there was no longer a hospital
65-1_482.928_9.4.wav_ASR	and and the biggest most difficult part of that was the short period of time
65-1_493.261_11.8.wav_ASR	and so i ended up with a franklin lamp and would write down everything in there just to help my short term memory
65-1_506.11_10.319.wav_ASR	so it was a fairly the aphasia and people seeing me different ways at work
65-1_516.482_4.701.wav_ASR	and and of course i look back on the few years after
65-1_521.2_2.859.wav_ASR	and and i did not deserve to be on the hospital track
65-1_524.107_3.97.wav_ASR	it was perfect otherwise everybody around me
65-1_528.092_0.72.wav_ASR	what was the name of it
65-1_530.176_14.41.wav_ASR	and that the right everything down was was the biggest issues to me at at how well do i have my job
65-1_567.07_6.54.wav_ASR	the basically it was at the the
65-1_573.891_4.62.wav_ASR	well i i i call it pre eighty first august
65-1_579.419_5.17.wav_ASR	that's how my my my life has been fine
65-1_585.51_11.37.wav_ASR	and that that that is what i call my my my finding moment at the the the the the finding event
65-1_597.64_8.89.wav_ASR	because i've struggled with the aphasia obviously and memory issues ever since then
65-1_606.552_13.22.wav_ASR	and and and i mean like four or five six years ago about an hour and a half outside of pittsburgh
65-1_619.826_1.84.wav_ASR	you had a job in annapolis
65-1_621.855_7.67.wav_ASR	and so the e m i paid rent to my folks lived in their house
65-1_630.113_6.18.wav_ASR	and that wedding my dad and firstnamem firstnamee a little small car a little car
65-1_637.015_3.44.wav_ASR	and it was quite an interesting experience
65-1_641.315_4.08.wav_ASR	and and interesting enough i can probably
65-1_645.41_8.3.wav_ASR	the the engine had a crasher for firstnamesj carotid artery rupture
65-1_653.791_1.8.wav_ASR	and i could probably still do day
65-1_655.869_1.58.wav_ASR	and this is nineteen sixty seven
65-1_658.288_2.76.wav_ASR	they're probably still dating the cinderella
65-1_662.6_3.89.wav_ASR	and but i but at the hospital last night
65-1_667.122_0.49.wav_ASR	can't talk
65-1_669.274_0.66.wav_ASR	so yeah
65-1_670.235_1.4.wav_ASR	short short term memory
65-1_671.658_13.02.wav_ASR	but then things from from long ago and do some something long ago
65-1_695.671_5.07.wav_ASR	oh no actually i was enrolled in college firstnamem
65-1_701.591_4.64.wav_ASR	and and i got out of school the spring of seven six years
65-1_706.317_1.95.wav_ASR	at a job of kind of come home firstnamesu
65-1_709.739_0.87.wav_ASR	and they're in the hospital
65-1_710.687_2.65.wav_ASR	and the firstnamew no longer alone exists
65-1_714.262_5.09.wav_ASR	but i was an engineer at that with the shipper
65-1_720.011_10.31.wav_ASR	and so i my my my cousins for firstnamer firstnamec for firstnamer firstnamec
65-1_731.149_9.58.wav_ASR	four or one of the ones cars had a a catalytic converter
65-1_745.046_7.51.wav_ASR	and the firstnamer firstnamee firstnamee firstnamee was all my childhood cousins
65-1_753.154_4.14.wav_ASR	so i was already doing that kind of stuff as a job
65-1_758.166_6.91.wav_ASR	but then my my father found this this article on an engineering firm
65-1_765.797_12.68.wav_ASR	and it just happened to be that it was a problem for him at the bottom of elementary school
65-1_778.497_8.96.wav_ASR	and and it it just is a kind of how i graduated
65-1_815.779_2.14.wav_ASR	well it was a real slippery
65-1_818.492_4.39.wav_ASR	you know that and the the hospital at the time was the doctors two years ago
65-1_823.884_3.99.wav_ASR	it was at the first of the firstnamese
65-1_828.597_6.2.wav_ASR	and and you use it from the top left down to the guy's face off
65-1_835.141_6.83.wav_ASR	and they could take and the the other guy's a doctor who figured how to help him
65-1_842.229_5.21.wav_ASR	it was it was a lot fun seeing their faces at me and my relatives
65-1_910.099_1.2.wav_ASR	oh okay
65-1_911.875_2.36.wav_ASR	the story is a a young lad
65-1_914.589_8.46.wav_ASR	looks like maybe ten years ago at six credit or so a credit card
65-1_923.492_6.72.wav_ASR	and then at firstnamer kicks it puts a soccer ball through a house window
65-1_930.915_8.97.wav_ASR	and the soccer ball comes through the house window and and lands on a a a a a ladder mall in the house
65-1_940.813_7.32.wav_ASR	and they'll get up holding the soccer ball and says try to figure out what's going on
65-1_951.714_0.38.wav_ASR	and i don't
65-1_971.063_5.65.wav_ASR	and looks like a a young boy is leaving
65-1_976.736_2.88.wav_ASR	and his mother said
65-1_979.897_1.4.wav_ASR	here's your umbrella
65-1_981.983_0.84.wav_ASR	and he says
65-1_983.049_1.03.wav_ASR	yeah i don't need that
65-1_984.13_4.77.wav_ASR	and then they leave saying goodbye and everything
65-1_989.831_1.61.wav_ASR	and the mom holding the umbrella
65-1_991.969_3.23.wav_ASR	and the the young lad is out and about walking around
65-1_995.914_1.2.wav_ASR	and it starts to rain
65-1_997.78_1.36.wav_ASR	and the surgery
65-1_999.75_0.79.wav_ASR	and he's running
65-1_1000.563_4.18.wav_ASR	and and gets back to his mom so slow and wet
65-1_1005.358_0.87.wav_ASR	and he's not happy
65-1_1006.245_1.13.wav_ASR	you know no no no no
65-1_1008.212_2.37.wav_ASR	and then he goes outside with an umbrella
65-1_1010.631_3.09.wav_ASR	and and it looks like all of a sudden all of a sudden all of a sudden all of a sudden
65-1_1027.309_5.9.wav_ASR	well the beginning it looks like a cat a cat that climbed up a tree
65-1_1034.269_3.46.wav_ASR	and being proud by a dog come up a tree
65-1_1038.222_1.16.wav_ASR	that stuck up on the tree
65-1_1040.013_8.761.wav_ASR	well a little girl who was probably her own right there in her tricycle and and this cat down
65-1_1049.333_10.48.wav_ASR	and look like an animal figure most like her dad they climbed up the tree and is and his and his and this barking dog
65-1_1060.56_5.52.wav_ASR	well now and now there's also a a bird or another side of the tree singing away
65-1_1066.533_11.02.wav_ASR	and there's also the look like fire department is showing up both the cat and the and the firstnamem
65-1_1077.577_2.22.wav_ASR	that that that's that that tree by the door
65-1_1353.355_0.3.wav_ASR	well thank you
65-1_1353.835_5.45.wav_ASR	so cinderella was her mother had passed away
65-1_1360.127_2.77.wav_ASR	father remarried
65-1_1363.72_8.84.wav_ASR	and there's the the wicked stepmother and that brought her two daughters
65-1_1373.655_13.75.wav_ASR	and and their in their home life cinderella's and the stepdaughters and abused by the stepdaughters
65-1_1387.769_7.59.wav_ASR	and and it just worked worked really worked a lot
65-1_1395.968_9.9.wav_ASR	and and in the kingdom the king had a an army son
65-1_1406.524_19.39.wav_ASR	and one of his kings and the king all of a half of all of the other animals in the kingdom with the prince married off
65-1_1427.134_24.41.wav_ASR	and cinderella with the mice and they're in a house at this where cinderella go to to where cinderella is where cinderella is
65-1_1451.694_17.08.wav_ASR	and the stepmother was angry on getting one of her daughters married off and then so would not allow cinderella to go to the ball
65-1_1469.504_3.98.wav_ASR	her stepsisters went
65-1_1474.182_11.98.wav_ASR	and and a circle of friends lived in michigan and then mines went up but turned into horses
65-1_1486.874_8.89.wav_ASR	and i think that the the horse from the house ended up as the driver of the pumpkin carriage
65-1_1496.594_3.35.wav_ASR	and she had a gown
65-1_1499.966_5.76.wav_ASR	all of the the prince danced night away with cinderella
65-1_1506.4_12.64.wav_ASR	and but the stepmother from the whole cinderella because everything was gonna go back to my mind because everything was gonna go back to the way it was at midnight
65-1_1519.217_1.04.wav_ASR	so it was
65-1_1520.273_3.71.wav_ASR	so she heard out of there and left a glass slipper behind
65-1_1524.602_11.17.wav_ASR	and and then after the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the
65-1_1535.789_2.93.wav_ASR	and it was the the gals left the last slipper behind
65-1_1538.769_9.72.wav_ASR	and and so the the insurance were sent out to try and figure out who was that lady last year
65-1_1549.451_11.43.wav_ASR	and and it was the the lady who's who fit this this small glass slipper
65-1_1561.723_3.47.wav_ASR	and the stepsisters know how to fix the glass slipper
65-1_1565.701_3.72.wav_ASR	ten dollars put would fit in the slipper
65-1_1569.443_7.35.wav_ASR	and so she was invited as the one that the prince wanted to marry
65-1_1576.915_5.67.wav_ASR	and and so then the cinderella remarried
65-1_1582.609_2.0.wav_ASR	you know all of a sudden they lived happily ever after
65-1_1595.381_4.76.wav_ASR	pretty pretty much on on wheel bread
65-1_1600.8_8.05.wav_ASR	you would use a knife and and the slipper peanut butter on one side of the bread
65-1_1609.79_6.11.wav_ASR	oh but then the other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other
65-1_1617.339_1.5.wav_ASR	and then she took a spoon
65-1_1619.081_5.76.wav_ASR	now not nice because he kicked up the the the jelly and the jar
65-1_1624.893_6.9.wav_ASR	but you take the spoon and and spoon out of the the grape jelly on the other piece of bread
65-1_1632.163_2.41.wav_ASR	useta that us a knife spread out spread it out
65-1_1634.597_2.32.wav_ASR	and then put the two halves together
65-1_1636.935_3.5.wav_ASR	and you got the alphabet peanut butter and jelly sandwich
65-2_8.167_1.85.wav_ASR	three pieces of bread
65-2_10.563_0.77.wav_ASR	much improved
65-2_12.338_9.08.wav_ASR	the holding of holding the speech surgery for words are it does less than it did
65-2_22.185_23.08.wav_ASR	the what happens is that if i have an agreement to tell a story or something like that i will make it and the most basic form and and think later
65-2_45.514_1.3.wav_ASR	and i should've said
65-2_46.935_0.67.wav_ASR	coulda said that
65-2_48.111_1.09.wav_ASR	why why didn't i say
65-2_49.95_6.53.wav_ASR	aphasia and the trouble in the motor control if there's some difficulty with a car
65-2_57.16_5.08.wav_ASR	it helps immensely if i think about it for about a day or so
65-2_62.323_26.47.wav_ASR	and let i see it before the lunchtime and finishing and thinking about it is the most of the most interesting part of the most difficult task
65-2_89.557_8.62.wav_ASR	and it's a right after i get a headache
65-2_98.79_1.57.wav_ASR	why didn't i think at that before
65-2_100.765_5.64.wav_ASR	and before my eighty firstnamer i would've thought of that email
65-2_107.061_5.26.wav_ASR	but it's much more difficult and and that takes longer than it did
65-2_112.37_1.84.wav_ASR	and that's like
65-2_114.233_1.4.wav_ASR	it's been that way for thirty six years
65-2_127.18_6.21.wav_ASR	the first one was firstnamee at an insurance
65-2_134.294_2.7.wav_ASR	and and cinderella
65-2_137.011_6.39.wav_ASR	and i i thought the old firstnamer hospital in the driveway door
65-2_144.01_12.54.wav_ASR	and had a firstnamep firstnamer firstnamep a a baseball card or firstnamer firstnamep firstnamer firstnamep firstnamer firstnamep firstnamer firstnamep firstnamer firstnamep firstnamer firstnamep firstnamerfirstnamep firstnamerfirstnamep firstnamerfirstnamep firstnamerfirstnamep firstnamerfirstnamep firstnamerfirstnamep firstnamerfirstnamep firstnamerfirstnamep firstnamerfirstnamep firstnamerfirstnamep firstnamerfirstnamep firstnamerfirstnamep firstnamerfirstnamep firstnamerfirstnamep firstnamerfirstnamep firstnamerfirstnamep firstnamerfirstnamep firstnamerfirstnamep firstnamerfirstnamep firstnamerfirstnamep firstnamerfirstnamep firstnamerfirstnamep firstnamerfirstnamep firstnamerfirstnamep firstnamerfirstnamep firstnamerfirstnamep firstnamerfirstnamep firstnamerfirstnamep firstnamerfirstnamep firstnamerfirstnamep firstnamerfirstnamep
65-2_157.19_1.61.wav_ASR	did i say boston lung
65-2_159.526_1.7.wav_ASR	seventy years ago
65-2_161.937_1.51.wav_ASR	three and a half at which in college
65-2_164.72_6.62.wav_ASR	and and i in a coma for three or four weeks
65-2_172.132_7.28.wav_ASR	hospital probably probably about two and half months
65-2_180.19_6.53.wav_ASR	and our third child was born three days after i was moved out of chicago
65-2_190.003_8.12.wav_ASR	and the second one was firstnamep and firstnamew named firstnamep called firstnamesj in nassau
65-2_199.113_2.48.wav_ASR	it was a firstnamet firstnamep on the left side
65-2_202.563_6.32.wav_ASR	and and my i believe that i was unconscious for
65-2_209.678_1.66.wav_ASR	well i i guess i don't know how long
65-2_212.237_10.04.wav_ASR	but i recall walking across the street starting cross and seeing the court firstnamer of the car and coming to me
65-2_223.056_2.51.wav_ASR	and then i had the c t scan around
65-2_226.386_7.17.wav_ASR	and and then later like firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel firstnamel

65-2_234.865_0.96.wav_ASR	twenty minutes later
65-2_236.459_2.59.wav_ASR	and and i was a great manager
65-2_239.878_5.52.wav_ASR	well i was in a wonderful mood because the eighty fourth last time before the accident
65-2_246.349_7.14.wav_ASR	and at this one firstnamem firstnamef i know exactly where i was what happened and what happened
65-2_254.174_2.51.wav_ASR	and i was in a really great room
65-2_257.551_13.19.wav_ASR	and then i say a brain injury because it was about one day or two days later
65-2_271.809_19.88.wav_ASR	and i was that that was the most effective pain in the in the leg from that the and in the leg if you know it was more concerned if you were
65-2_292.55_3.94.wav_ASR	it did finally go down when the brain stroke went down
65-2_296.863_0.66.wav_ASR	finally we went
65-2_297.627_3.16.wav_ASR	and i've called maybe three or four
65-2_303.117_1.68.wav_ASR	well last time somebody noticed me out of time
65-2_305.602_7.65.wav_ASR	and and the doctors could not tell me whether it would ever go away
65-2_313.306_5.33.wav_ASR	it was already part of the program
65-2_318.652_8.33.wav_ASR	and i call that the orthopedic guy that stuck a peanut butter on my my my tibia said
65-2_327.006_12.71.wav_ASR	well after after three or four months when they all of the fish and the tvs and the tibet people started to heal he said
65-2_340.67_4.18.wav_ASR	oh boy you know that's probably the most painful injury known to me
65-2_345.576_0.85.wav_ASR	oh okay

65-2_447.04_0.75.wav_ASR	oh call it
65-2_449.397_1.27.wav_ASR	well we'll say we're in philadelphia
65-2_450.939_2.51.wav_ASR	but learned how to use their there at home
65-2_454.232_6.24.wav_ASR	and of course this before the this four or five years ago and that's kind of thing
65-2_460.758_11.03.wav_ASR	but i i've been doing a nassau rrc for quite a long time
65-2_472.499_9.05.wav_ASR	and but that was all on the ibuprofen that kind of stuff or a rash dot computer
65-2_482.344_4.62.wav_ASR	and and so here's a simple little laptop
65-2_486.979_1.14.wav_ASR	how do i use it
65-2_488.329_4.44.wav_ASR	and so they brought this my my boss bought this laptop down
65-2_492.784_4.6.wav_ASR	and and those years there was a a university came along with them
65-2_498.448_4.81.wav_ASR	and it's trying to use a computer user interface
65-2_503.994_7.47.wav_ASR	if you're right a microphone or kind of microphone
65-2_512.342_14.661.wav_ASR	and one of the one thing in particular which was a problem when the and the firstnamem was at school something
65-2_528.184_0.51.wav_ASR	selec
65-2_528.839_12.43.wav_ASR	well have we never had any trouble and in a lap top or microwave what what did select me
65-2_542.262_6.07.wav_ASR	and and after several days of trying to figure out what select men
65-2_548.888_1.04.wav_ASR	there was a hospital
65-2_550.399_0.6.wav_ASR	so like me
65-2_551.438_0.49.wav_ASR	aphasia
65-2_552.509_5.58.wav_ASR	well last month what what they meant by september i couldn't figure it
65-2_558.551_0.56.wav_ASR	it could
65-2_559.312_1.04.wav_ASR	there are no way
65-2_560.944_2.31.wav_ASR	and i'm already trouble really trouble about it
65-2_564.422_5.97.wav_ASR	and so finally i called a coworker and said
65-2_570.608_3.88.wav_ASR	what what what do they call it when they say c t
65-2_575.568_7.44.wav_ASR	and it drove the firstnamer and moved the curser down and moving the curser around and hiking in arizona
65-2_583.899_1.23.wav_ASR	that's what they met by themselves
65-2_585.777_2.95.wav_ASR	well hell hell hell hell hell hell hell hell hell hell hell hell hell hell hell hell hell hell hell hell
65-2_589.857_3.86.wav_ASR	and that that really that threw me for a loop or so
65-2_594.838_7.3.wav_ASR	and so i i became very questioning of the world where i would go back to work even functioning at work
65-2_603.43_5.21.wav_ASR	and and so finally the they see the the tip from the coworkers
65-2_609.025_0.57.wav_ASR	oh okay
65-2_609.645_8.98.wav_ASR	but it was most basic of terms which is the the firstnamem firstnamej
65-2_619.047_2.1.wav_ASR	but i know there's a doctor not microchondrologist
65-2_621.166_1.3.wav_ASR	it was before michigan state university
65-2_623.365_14.01.wav_ASR	as firstnamem it did not conform to somebody else would have the the the golf and stuff
65-2_638.605_1.01.wav_ASR	they did not
65-2_640.35_2.3.wav_ASR	the firstnamem did not describe that anyway
65-2_643.738_14.19.wav_ASR	and so i went back to work and working with the aphasia and firstnamemush and firstnamer firstnamemush and firstnamerfirstnamemush and firstnamerfirstnamemush and firstnamerfirstnamemush and firstnamerfirstnamemush and firstnamerfirstnamemush and firstnamerfirstnamemush and firstnamerfirstnamemush and firstnamerfirstnamemush and firstnamerfirstnamemush and firstnamerfirstnamemush and firstnamerfirstnamemush and firstnamerfirstnamemush and firstnamerfirstnamemush and firstnamerfirstnamemush and firstnamerfirstnamemush and firstnamerfirstnamemush and firstnamerfirstnamemush and firstnamerfirstnamemush and firstnamerfirstnamemush and firstnamerfirstnamemush and firstnamerfirstnamemush and firstnamerfirstnam
65-2_658.457_15.64.wav_ASR	and and finally my after a couple years ago come to the front line and and said
65-2_675.07_5.2.wav_ASR	you might might have it take the firstnamer and then right stuff down
65-2_681.229_2.47.wav_ASR	and so well that was a gosho
65-2_684.72_2.15.wav_ASR	we're just being able to the right thing down
65-2_686.892_1.67.wav_ASR	so i i carry a small
65-2_689.233_0.96.wav_ASR	how how do they right now
65-2_690.968_8.11.wav_ASR	so i care a small not not not not no no no no no no no no no
65-2_699.671_10.58.wav_ASR	because that that was right when i figured out when my my boss firstnamer called me at one of the front desk phones
65-2_710.85_7.47.wav_ASR	all of a mackinaw that was not no no no no no no no no no
65-2_719.266_2.66.wav_ASR	that that department
65-2_721.95_17.32.wav_ASR	and also i ended up as a cardiologist for the company at that shows shows a conversation all kinds of stuff
65-2_739.905_10.88.wav_ASR	when i meet people where i'll always say their name over and over and over again to myself
65-2_751.358_5.4.wav_ASR	use their name and any kind of rehabilitation professional communication with them
65-2_757.276_2.99.wav_ASR	you understand every time for us a name or two times last name or three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve one one two three four five six seven eight nine ten
65-2_760.315_4.68.wav_ASR	and and then after the conversation right there after the conversation right down
65-2_766.354_8.45.wav_ASR	and and that that's been a life drinker that i that i still use today
65-2_775.921_2.94.wav_ASR	for example i met a in their neighborhood
65-2_779.492_1.18.wav_ASR	and i'm at home now
65-2_781.203_0.98.wav_ASR	not down the farm
65-2_782.926_11.55.wav_ASR	and met a fellow in the neighborhood about a half an hour ago and and he moved to the neighborhood some time back
65-2_794.526_1.25.wav_ASR	and i got it now
65-2_795.797_6.87.wav_ASR	and let it and set his name over and the like my wife about it and then ran out
65-2_803.378_7.6.wav_ASR	and this morning i saw him out of a walk and couldn't recall the name of firstnamesa but then thought for awhile
65-2_810.996_1.51.wav_ASR	and then finally the name came to him
65-2_813.742_14.39.wav_ASR	so but the cinderella on on recovering news is quite right and involved in philadelphia
65-2_839.375_0.52.wav_ASR	yes
65-2_840.697_4.78.wav_ASR	they i'm thinking to you last week
65-2_846.085_1.32.wav_ASR	maybe not positive
65-2_847.746_4.92.wav_ASR	time i spent the time is at the rehab hospital in philadelphia
65-2_853.54_6.13.wav_ASR	and because i started off with twenty years after the eighty firstnamer
65-2_860.446_8.79.wav_ASR	and it became better trouble for the brain neurologist who just didn't do therapy for the brain and those years
65-2_869.993_1.69.wav_ASR	so there's no therapy
65-2_871.699_1.97.wav_ASR	you just you are able to survive
65-2_873.684_3.67.wav_ASR	and i think you'll be able to just discharge hospital go home
65-2_878.184_5.53.wav_ASR	and because they just did not do therapy and those years
65-2_883.737_16.3.wav_ASR	and over the course of twelve years later that the firstnamew firstnamep married firstnamesp and i found out about people at firstnamepfirstnamep
65-2_901.056_3.61.wav_ASR	and the firstnamer married firstnamesp is four to five times a year
65-2_905.719_4.72.wav_ASR	as what they're telling people even fifty years ago
65-2_911.291_15.93.wav_ASR	and so i wanna share that with firstnamesa just to give them hope that that recovery is possible is possible
65-2_928.404_1.38.wav_ASR	it useta take a long time
65-2_930.61_10.94.wav_ASR	and in october when i started their arizona it was november first and their families
65-2_942.297_1.58.wav_ASR	uhhuh a year ago
65-2_944.156_1.01.wav_ASR	here are your earbuds
65-2_945.302_0.94.wav_ASR	you're not ever gonna remember them ever after
65-2_947.407_3.51.wav_ASR	hey you don't stop recovering
65-2_950.937_7.04.wav_ASR	and the right maybe firstnamer if you will and slow down pretty far after a year or so
65-2_958.775_1.9.wav_ASR	you never never stopped recovering
65-2_961.454_7.72.wav_ASR	oh i had a and the eight or eleven firstnamem i had a dead spot with no feeling about the left hand
65-2_970.136_2.65.wav_ASR	and there's something at that address
65-2_972.842_1.73.wav_ASR	and there was like a bunch of it
65-2_974.655_0.98.wav_ASR	you know no big deal
65-2_975.956_3.16.wav_ASR	to stick a peanut butter and that would wouldn't wouldn't wouldn't wouldn't wouldn't wouldn't
65-2_979.96_1.4.wav_ASR	oh no no no no
65-2_981.865_4.86.wav_ASR	and then it was probably about twelve years ago or so
65-2_987.413_0.4.wav_ASR	the firstnamese
65-2_987.879_0.74.wav_ASR	and i think it was nine o'clock
65-2_989.309_5.7.wav_ASR	twenty five years after the eighty first one morning
65-2_996.424_4.47.wav_ASR	and i had feeling in the spot that had no feelings of twenty five years
65-2_1002.063_12.36.wav_ASR	so what i'm telling actually is that the recovery may start at firstnamem but still slow down significantly
65-2_1014.632_2.9.wav_ASR	that's that's the whole problem
65-2_1017.689_1.16.wav_ASR	you'd just don't know how to figure it
65-2_1019.52_6.059.wav_ASR	and i don't remember
65-2_1068.805_3.42.wav_ASR	yes it's not not not not right i don't know
65-2_1072.242_7.48.wav_ASR	it's the time time time time is you're five and this kind of case
65-2_1080.467_7.98.wav_ASR	because you you feel like the feelings that you don't have it well less an important part
65-2_1088.535_2.52.wav_ASR	and and you'll notice one day you know
65-2_1091.749_2.26.wav_ASR	crash i i i feel far away from it didn't have before
65-2_1094.551_1.56.wav_ASR	actually it will happen
65-2_1096.384_0.98.wav_ASR	you will appreciate that
65-2_1108.416_2.63.wav_ASR	actually i don't know
65-2_1111.095_6.75.wav_ASR	it was it was me and i was used to a little bit of one or two weeks ago
65-2_1118.126_4.87.wav_ASR	and i don't know if i i don't know if i got used to it or not
65-2_1124.138_3.5.wav_ASR	but like two or three years later just put on the soccer one morning
65-2_1128.17_0.83.wav_ASR	peanut butter
65-2_1129.343_1.05.wav_ASR	oh i got feeling better
65-2_1131.24_2.06.wav_ASR	and hit hit had not been before
65-2_1134.534_0.63.wav_ASR	you know what happened
65-2_1135.397_0.91.wav_ASR	and i have no idea
65-2_1149.083_1.64.wav_ASR	they will it will
65-2_1150.924_0.87.wav_ASR	that neurosurgeon worked
65-2_1151.84_1.31.wav_ASR	and they they will ask
65-2_1153.17_0.46.wav_ASR	they will
65-2_1173.169_4.87.wav_ASR	when when i first first time met my firstnamew when i met my wife
65-2_1179.585_5.52.wav_ASR	when when she and i first met we're when we first met

65-2_1229.596_7.78.wav_ASR	well i i will arrive at the place a little earlier giving control of the situation
65-2_1238.004_3.79.wav_ASR	and so i ended up being just a little bit earlier for the dance there
65-2_1242.551_5.71.wav_ASR	and and my wife and her her her wingman are
65-2_1248.927_1.99.wav_ASR	you guys go with big girls

65-2_1278.901_2.74.wav_ASR	he is the the dance here
65-2_1281.66_2.44.wav_ASR	and well i panic
65-2_1284.355_0.44.wav_ASR	process of being

65-2_1285.671_4.64.wav_ASR	and and they i'm just i hung around
65-2_1290.557_3.4.wav_ASR	and i i ran her that that that dance
65-2_1294.796_2.28.wav_ASR	and that's where we started dating
65-2_1297.1_3.94.wav_ASR	and and it's three days or four or five days
65-2_1301.09_1.27.wav_ASR	they took them around three or four years ago
65-2_1303.312_4.59.wav_ASR	and after about four years ago now maybe somebody's going on here
65-2_1307.917_1.44.wav_ASR	and i'm gonna get more serious about this
65-2_1310.334_6.28.wav_ASR	so it was i i used her of picking me up at at a school dance
65-2_1317.648_2.02.wav_ASR	that's where we were first met and she picked me up at the door
65-2_1359.514_5.59.wav_ASR	and a young boy looks like a girl schooler is had a soccer
65-2_1365.124_0.54.wav_ASR	what's your name
65-2_1366.388_2.61.wav_ASR	and he that ends up going to the hospital
65-2_1369.723_9.4.wav_ASR	the elderly man on a couch there in the window is sitting right by where the soccer ball comes through and surprises him
65-2_1379.989_6.19.wav_ASR	and then they he gets the ball to find out just what went on
65-2_1402.182_12.63.wav_ASR	and the beginning this mother it appears has had an umbrella and one to give it to her son before go off to school or go somewhere
65-2_1415.551_2.24.wav_ASR	and he says
65-2_1418.288_0.93.wav_ASR	and he says no and says
65-2_1419.62_0.77.wav_ASR	oh no mom
65-2_1421.306_1.08.wav_ASR	and then firstnamee
65-2_1422.451_2.41.wav_ASR	and then in the middle and started raining on him
65-2_1425.438_1.43.wav_ASR	and then rain heavy on him
65-2_1426.933_7.19.wav_ASR	and then and then he goes back home just a soccer ball is with mother coming at it
65-2_1434.453_6.25.wav_ASR	and then last the end of the story was he learned his lesson and had the umbrella with him as walking in the rain
65-2_1455.01_13.73.wav_ASR	the way this started was at and it looks like that there's a a dog at the base of the tree
65-2_1469.12_2.18.wav_ASR	the dog is barking at this guy
65-2_1471.974_7.79.wav_ASR	and on the tree there's a cat with a girl down below this cat
65-2_1480.206_6.04.wav_ASR	and it would appear that a cat climbed up the tree
65-2_1487.152_3.15.wav_ASR	they a little girl climbed up the tree and got stuck up there
65-2_1491.016_10.21.wav_ASR	they they by mail a mailman was either chasing up the tree to help the little guy to help the little cat
65-2_1501.878_3.4.wav_ASR	there's also a firetruck and a fire engine
65-2_1506.838_1.32.wav_ASR	the fire fireman coming a ladder
65-2_1508.684_7.57.wav_ASR	and it looks like the ladder is being used by the firemen to rescue either the man or both
65-2_1517.004_11.24.wav_ASR	and and a cinderella is over in a room just sitting away just enjoying the old old stuff
65-2_1528.296_3.07.wav_ASR	oh
65-2_1754.983_9.4.wav_ASR	firstnamec was a daughter of a a cinderella who was
65-2_1764.522_2.45.wav_ASR	her mother had passed away
65-2_1767.818_1.36.wav_ASR	and their father remarried
65-2_1769.925_8.29.wav_ASR	and the stepmother had two two two daughters
65-2_1778.914_21.3.wav_ASR	and as they were married the stepmother and stepmother remarried cinderella around the house where the stepdaughters were doing business nothing
65-2_1801.139_8.38.wav_ASR	and so cinderella spent her time working at that kind of stuff around the house
65-2_1810.138_10.22.wav_ASR	and and in that in the kingdom there was a prince who was not married
65-2_1821.196_18.68.wav_ASR	and aphasia express express express express express the his son and his two daughters are getting the his son's computer in the kingdom
65-2_1840.902_3.19.wav_ASR	so the word is out about the ball coming up
65-2_1844.858_6.3.wav_ASR	firstnamec cinderella was really happy about the ball coming up as far as the stepsisters
65-2_1851.712_16.43.wav_ASR	and so they the far away from cinderella for cinderella or cinderella for the ball
65-2_1868.918_10.26.wav_ASR	and and then at the last moment the stepmother told cinderella she was not going to the ball
65-2_1879.2_8.54.wav_ASR	and and the stepdaughters were really really mean to her
65-2_1888.574_2.81.wav_ASR	and so the stepdaughters went to the ball
65-2_1892.097_14.38.wav_ASR	and but in the meantime well before the ball or at the for the ball they cinderella showed up and and said that will
65-2_1906.5_5.6.wav_ASR	and so it made for her a just a lovely gown
65-2_1912.863_16.73.wav_ASR	and they're turned into a coke called by my my my firstnamem and turn into horses
65-2_1930.594_4.29.wav_ASR	and so and she ended up going to go to the ball
65-2_1935.637_15.69.wav_ASR	and the prince was appointed with the stepdaughters and everyone hit it off with cinderella
65-2_1951.795_2.29.wav_ASR	and upstanding the night dancing with cinderella
65-2_1954.409_7.13.wav_ASR	the girl mother told cinderella at midnight because this this all will be by midnight because this all will be midnight
65-2_1962.363_5.08.wav_ASR	and so the the prince and cinderella were dancing at midnight
65-2_1967.926_1.87.wav_ASR	and and cinderella
65-2_1970.219_0.31.wav_ASR	oh no
65-2_1970.547_6.69.wav_ASR	and that runs runs out of the round one glass slipper one glass slipper one glass slipper
65-2_1978.161_9.82.wav_ASR	and as she's being driven around the the coach turned back into a pumpkin
65-2_1988.0_2.49.wav_ASR	and the horses turned back into the mice
65-2_1990.617_5.26.wav_ASR	and the the footman her back in the house and are are doctors
65-2_1996.13_0.56.wav_ASR	and i remember it
65-2_1997.231_3.15.wav_ASR	and then so but still that it was over
65-2_2000.401_10.91.wav_ASR	and and then after the ball the prince decided that there was only the cinderella they were interested in
65-2_2012.653_3.04.wav_ASR	now everybody knew who was cinderella was and could not find her
65-2_2016.419_10.69.wav_ASR	and so he put his issue out of the last slipper cinderella with the glass slipper that she left behind
65-2_2027.888_3.08.wav_ASR	and came to cinderella's house

thompson04a_437.128_0.45.wav_ASR	well let's see
thompson04a_440.854_5.91.wav_ASR	you hafta get with blood
thompson04a_448.675_4.12.wav_ASR	and having that rain there
thompson04a_452.956_1.13.wav_ASR	you know all of this
thompson04a_454.259_3.57.wav_ASR	but all of this to do right here
thompson04a_465.565_1.68.wav_ASR	it has been terrible
thompson04a_475.274_2.86.wav_ASR	and and i mean terrible
thompson04a_478.653_0.69.wav_ASR	everything
thompson04a_479.521_1.46.wav_ASR	and i don't like any other
thompson04a_485.534_4.43.wav_ASR	but you you don't right here at all
thompson04a_489.984_0.8.wav_ASR	you gotta do it
thompson04a_492.098_0.6.wav_ASR	uhhuh
thompson04a_494.928_0.34.wav_ASR	well let's see
thompson04a_505.061_0.48.wav_ASR	what
thompson04a_511.001_1.49.wav_ASR	well i got a lot of those
thompson04a_514.072_4.77.wav_ASR	well i like them all
thompson04a_520.23_0.61.wav_ASR	you yeah
thompson04a_521.855_0.49.wav_ASR	yeah
thompson04a_523.121_0.73.wav_ASR	probably
thompson04a_526.29_10.82.wav_ASR	eight and now cinderella is
thompson04a_538.978_4.14.wav_ASR	oh oh well
thompson04a_544.486_0.78.wav_ASR	that's what it is
thompson04a_545.343_1.02.wav_ASR	that's what it is
thompson04a_547.259_5.14.wav_ASR	well one two three four five six seven
thompson04a_553.999_0.56.wav_ASR	oh oh
thompson04a_556.035_5.43.wav_ASR	oh i don't know
thompson04a_566.895_0.53.wav_ASR	follow it
thompson04a_568.405_0.57.wav_ASR	you know
thompson04a_569.401_0.9.wav_ASR	and that was right
thompson04a_573.076_1.59.wav_ASR	so that's what we do a lot of times
thompson04a_580.365_2.42.wav_ASR	we did a lot of things
thompson04a_582.994_2.22.wav_ASR	we really did lots of what
thompson04a_585.618_0.47.wav_ASR	you did
thompson04a_587.656_1.85.wav_ASR	and we had good tips
thompson04a_625.168_6.19.wav_ASR	well firstnamesb is a ball
thompson04a_632.063_10.18.wav_ASR	and it's shoes
thompson04a_645.671_1.2.wav_ASR	that's not what
thompson04a_647.082_1.51.wav_ASR	should be right right
thompson04a_648.774_1.69.wav_ASR	yeah right
thompson04a_651.582_1.04.wav_ASR	but that's what he says
thompson04a_652.643_2.25.wav_ASR	and he's going to go over to the window
thompson04a_655.361_8.78.wav_ASR	and then it goes back into the bed but
thompson04a_664.827_1.97.wav_ASR	well i say yes
thompson04a_667.577_2.7.wav_ASR	and the but it is come back here
thompson04a_670.524_1.18.wav_ASR	and then that
thompson04a_671.933_5.95.wav_ASR	and this is where he is exactly with the ball
thompson04a_678.822_4.29.wav_ASR	and right here on his things
thompson04a_683.506_0.58.wav_ASR	and i thought
thompson04a_685.979_1.15.wav_ASR	is that wonderful
thompson04a_689.329_0.47.wav_ASR	you know
thompson04a_690.252_0.68.wav_ASR	never but
thompson04a_690.951_0.73.wav_ASR	so right
thompson04a_718.06_5.55.wav_ASR	oh well then when she's done with her umbrella
thompson04a_723.947_1.69.wav_ASR	and she's going home
thompson04a_725.814_1.36.wav_ASR	well let them go to go that
thompson04a_727.275_1.5.wav_ASR	and we told him
thompson04a_728.934_1.61.wav_ASR	yes sir i'm just right here
thompson04a_730.629_3.16.wav_ASR	you don't really need it but i'll have it anyway
thompson04a_733.866_1.23.wav_ASR	so they're going to do
thompson04a_735.374_2.04.wav_ASR	and now oh boy
thompson04a_737.915_20.01.wav_ASR	here is the umbrella or the rain
thompson04a_759.78_2.56.wav_ASR	and now now they're really back
thompson04a_762.358_4.75.wav_ASR	boy is shot from this one to this one
thompson04a_769.393_0.93.wav_ASR	and so he says
thompson04a_770.372_0.9.wav_ASR	that's back
thompson04a_771.668_0.5.wav_ASR	oh well i thought
thompson04a_772.85_3.03.wav_ASR	he was told you know he knew that it wasn't gonna do it
thompson04a_776.376_1.28.wav_ASR	and that's what he did
thompson04a_777.764_3.69.wav_ASR	and now that this time he's back with what the
thompson04a_784.973_0.91.wav_ASR	is that right
thompson04a_805.778_0.51.wav_ASR	uhhuh
thompson04a_817.409_8.3.wav_ASR	well of course you got the the cat
thompson04a_828.233_7.5.wav_ASR	and here is trying to get back in to get her to come back here
thompson04a_837.863_1.27.wav_ASR	and she started that
thompson04a_839.181_2.29.wav_ASR	but that's just firstnamesj
thompson04a_842.118_0.86.wav_ASR	don't care that
thompson04a_846.898_0.57.wav_ASR	when we do this

UCL02a_6.639_0.36.wav_ASR	you know
UCL02a_11.585_0.35.wav_ASR	who is it
UCL02a_13.404_4.57.wav_ASR	to tell about my my speech and how it is to day this week or
UCL02a_18.68_2.04.wav_ASR	well it could be today or will be tomorrow
UCL02a_25.837_2.86.wav_ASR	my speech and this talk to me
UCL02a_31.699_1.62.wav_ASR	and i thought
UCL02a_34.593_2.69.wav_ASR	well they don't know
UCL02a_37.33_2.09.wav_ASR	so sometimes it's a bit this morning is not
UCL02a_39.439_0.94.wav_ASR	that's what i was saying
UCL02a_40.4_0.93.wav_ASR	it's a pretty nice day
UCL02a_43.429_1.1.wav_ASR	excuse me i can't be good
UCL02a_44.544_1.86.wav_ASR	sometimes i can't talk
UCL02a_47.789_2.6.wav_ASR	not here what's happening about me now
UCL02a_50.411_1.47.wav_ASR	can't
UCL02a_53.073_3.41.wav_ASR	you know the same time of me a big problem with me one two three four five six seven eight nine ten one one two three four five six seven eight nine
UCL02a_56.5_1.63.wav_ASR	you know that the dad
UCL02a_58.449_1.89.wav_ASR	but it's tough me at that now i don't remember
UCL02a_61.489_4.3.wav_ASR	some weeks i think i can hear about everything
UCL02a_66.983_3.54.wav_ASR	and i can hear everything
UCL02a_70.775_5.62.wav_ASR	and then suddenly it just disappears from me now
UCL02a_77.532_0.76.wav_ASR	it's hard to tell
UCL02a_78.308_2.25.wav_ASR	sometimes only one day he can be perfect
UCL02a_81.517_1.77.wav_ASR	well not perfect i mean but it's decent
UCL02a_83.309_5.47.wav_ASR	and sometimes it's i just can't hear something you know
UCL02a_88.8_1.82.wav_ASR	that's a difficult thing when with the speech
UCL02a_92.492_4.69.wav_ASR	and then i told someone it's okay
UCL02a_97.24_3.13.wav_ASR	and then of course somebody one word is just difficult for me as well
UCL02a_100.812_1.34.wav_ASR	well i forgot about it
UCL02a_102.173_0.54.wav_ASR	that's okay
UCL02a_103.893_3.39.wav_ASR	and then suddenly one word is bringing to speak forever
UCL02a_107.33_0.65.wav_ASR	it's good for me
UCL02a_108.7_2.11.wav_ASR	and then suddenly just made me so tired
UCL02a_111.006_1.62.wav_ASR	well not tired but i just can't hear
UCL02a_112.82_1.55.wav_ASR	he's difficult to tell you know
UCL02a_115.317_8.88.wav_ASR	yeah when i talk about well
UCL02a_124.218_1.15.wav_ASR	so many things about me well
UCL02a_125.597_8.35.wav_ASR	and i try many times about my speaking to everybody
UCL02a_134.03_3.34.wav_ASR	sometimes it's better
UCL02a_137.419_4.91.wav_ASR	when people are talking to me and then i guess that what they talk to me is
UCL02a_142.345_3.14.wav_ASR	and i think maybe one little word is is difficult for me now
UCL02a_146.052_0.98.wav_ASR	one of us is gone
UCL02a_147.699_2.65.wav_ASR	and then once upon a time i couldn't hear anything
UCL02a_151.038_4.42.wav_ASR	that's the best part of it
UCL02a_155.949_12.23.wav_ASR	sometimes the bad thing is you know you i can't do anything for me
UCL02a_168.2_1.91.wav_ASR	and that's bit much better
UCL02a_171.11_1.02.wav_ASR	it's very difficult for me
UCL02a_172.344_1.12.wav_ASR	it was very difficult sometimes
UCL02a_173.565_1.16.wav_ASR	and when you're really bad with it
UCL02a_175.216_2.16.wav_ASR	you gotta speak to my
UCL02a_177.398_0.78.wav_ASR	he's up to me
UCL02a_178.199_1.64.wav_ASR	that's very difficult sometimes
UCL02a_180.635_5.7.wav_ASR	and you're getting frustrated frustrated
UCL02a_186.35_0.66.wav_ASR	you know what i'm saying
UCL02a_187.33_0.32.wav_ASR	oh yes
UCL02a_188.404_3.4.wav_ASR	well that can be terrible sometimes
UCL02a_192.01_4.9.wav_ASR	sometimes like
UCL02a_198.705_2.08.wav_ASR	do they look at me about what i'm talking as well
UCL02a_200.83_1.55.wav_ASR	so what i know is i know reading books
UCL02a_202.4_2.79.wav_ASR	so you know before i did my strokes you know before i did my stroke
UCL02a_205.21_1.04.wav_ASR	but i read a book
UCL02a_206.693_3.1.wav_ASR	now it's difficult for me as i speaking but my books to me
UCL02a_210.781_7.56.wav_ASR	and the other thing for me sometimes i remember some of my books about two pages and then i call them
UCL02a_218.619_3.13.wav_ASR	now half the pages are reading about and then suddenly
UCL02a_222.2_2.17.wav_ASR	good good but i'm really not bothered if i remember about that
UCL02a_224.65_1.38.wav_ASR	and then somebody one brain hurt
UCL02a_226.05_0.43.wav_ASR	just gone
UCL02a_226.69_0.88.wav_ASR	it was terrible well
UCL02a_228.468_4.2.wav_ASR	so many times when i'm reading again i kind of thought about this time before
UCL02a_232.729_1.01.wav_ASR	well it's terrible you know
UCL02a_234.485_8.7.wav_ASR	yeah i think they're all those phones and things like that for me as well
UCL02a_243.916_13.13.wav_ASR	well what's the phones or firstnamesj dvs some times i hafta watch every time to somebody says
UCL02a_258.261_9.22.wav_ASR	that's how saturday and i the next day again or something like that
UCL02a_268.09_0.94.wav_ASR	so the thing i'm asking
UCL02a_269.046_0.67.wav_ASR	that's quite good
UCL02a_270.468_3.7.wav_ASR	because i don't know whether they talk about it
UCL02a_274.691_5.27.wav_ASR	summers are really good for me in the whole thing is well
UCL02a_282.717_3.23.wav_ASR	and then of course what happened to me with my stroke is well
UCL02a_285.97_2.58.wav_ASR	of course you know i did what college music
UCL02a_288.565_1.94.wav_ASR	that was the c t
UCL02a_292.355_5.18.wav_ASR	that's the all the cosmetic cosmetics
UCL02a_297.553_2.03.wav_ASR	so i was living in german and spanish and stuff like that
UCL02a_299.599_4.57.wav_ASR	that was one of the things i was doing is the management of all the complex with me there
UCL02a_305.791_4.38.wav_ASR	at least my my consciousness is there and god
UCL02a_311.267_2.23.wav_ASR	it was strange me to me
UCL02a_314.212_3.28.wav_ASR	and i can hear the words properly
UCL02a_317.508_1.67.wav_ASR	all the sound of the music is that
UCL02a_319.2_1.21.wav_ASR	can you hear anything particular
UCL02a_320.824_0.96.wav_ASR	and then somebody said
UCL02a_322.053_0.66.wav_ASR	yes that's it
UCL02a_323.079_2.0.wav_ASR	well i i know how to use it
UCL02a_325.1_0.75.wav_ASR	and i can hear it well
UCL02a_326.28_0.58.wav_ASR	but i don't say
UCL02a_327.06_3.92.wav_ASR	you know so it was a bit of a battle over and that that
UCL02a_331.0_0.95.wav_ASR	oh i can see it but that
UCL02a_332.315_0.63.wav_ASR	and then suddenly
UCL02a_333.511_1.24.wav_ASR	you know what i'm talking about
UCL02a_334.876_1.23.wav_ASR	it was the firstnamepb's place
UCL02a_336.218_1.82.wav_ASR	that's one word is just gone for me
UCL02a_339.028_2.35.wav_ASR	you're gonna get a peanut butter
UCL02a_341.4_0.32.wav_ASR	oh okay
UCL02a_341.803_0.93.wav_ASR	and firstnamese is my aunt
UCL02a_342.829_1.91.wav_ASR	you know i can remember the word up here
UCL02a_344.964_0.93.wav_ASR	can't hear all of it
UCL02a_347.417_4.47.wav_ASR	but the classical music is well done god
UCL02a_351.907_3.12.wav_ASR	and i mean thank you my neurologist is well
UCL02a_355.5_1.15.wav_ASR	for singing just now
UCL02a_357.482_1.78.wav_ASR	and reading the books can be difficult for me
UCL02a_360.193_2.99.wav_ASR	the phones i need the suggestions
UCL02a_363.263_3.04.wav_ASR	but then with the music it's pretty tough i mean you know
UCL02a_367.126_5.98.wav_ASR	many things happened with me and my my my face yeah and things like that a couple of people was
UCL02a_373.127_1.85.wav_ASR	and i mean at the beginning of university
UCL02a_374.999_1.1.wav_ASR	well that helps people well
UCL02a_376.116_0.31.wav_ASR	oh my gosh
UCL02a_376.48_0.38.wav_ASR	and i thought
UCL02a_377.882_5.1.wav_ASR	uhhuh i don't know
UCL02a_383.006_1.68.wav_ASR	it's a little things as well you know
UCL02a_384.93_2.72.wav_ASR	so little things but what

UCL02a_394.094_1.97.wav_ASR	that was me on the actual date that happened to me yes
UCL02a_397.44_1.06.wav_ASR	what happened
UCL02a_399.855_1.57.wav_ASR	well that was in the office
UCL02a_402.334_3.75.wav_ASR	that's the this twenty years yeah
UCL02a_407.543_0.84.wav_ASR	ten years
UCL02a_408.4_1.08.wav_ASR	you know it's making sense of day
UCL02a_409.58_2.56.wav_ASR	that's the only before four years ago
UCL02a_414.5_2.34.wav_ASR	yes i suppose what i really remember is
UCL02a_416.862_0.77.wav_ASR	and he was in the elevator
UCL02a_417.65_1.01.wav_ASR	and i got to work
UCL02a_419.58_2.06.wav_ASR	and it's about nine thirty the morning
UCL02a_422.308_1.74.wav_ASR	aphasia is in the tube
UCL02a_424.068_1.71.wav_ASR	and then i'm gonna catch my bus
UCL02a_427.382_1.25.wav_ASR	and they got there into work
UCL02a_429.05_1.69.wav_ASR	and i remember it was really strange
UCL02a_432.378_3.07.wav_ASR	and i was gonna go to my computer
UCL02a_436.506_0.97.wav_ASR	and then suddenly
UCL02a_437.5_2.4.wav_ASR	you know i'm just so much confused about it
UCL02a_440.439_4.99.wav_ASR	and i couldn't remember what is my computer
UCL02a_445.929_3.87.wav_ASR	well my my my code you know you're right things
UCL02a_450.603_0.68.wav_ASR	come here
UCL02a_451.3_1.04.wav_ASR	close it up
UCL02a_452.404_0.36.wav_ASR	so
UCL02a_454.288_1.27.wav_ASR	but i'm not my cougar
UCL02a_455.628_0.46.wav_ASR	and i said
UCL02a_456.246_7.3.wav_ASR	and i don't remember how to use my computer and things like that
UCL02a_464.158_1.26.wav_ASR	and then she suddenly noticed
UCL02a_465.465_2.41.wav_ASR	and she said to me i wasn't the best student of my life
UCL02a_468.953_0.57.wav_ASR	that's the other person
UCL02a_470.161_1.38.wav_ASR	okay and that's it
UCL02a_471.8_0.6.wav_ASR	when i thought
UCL02a_474.207_0.79.wav_ASR	it was fine for me
UCL02a_475.017_1.76.wav_ASR	and walking around the things like that you know
UCL02a_476.8_2.11.wav_ASR	it's my brain is
UCL02a_480.117_4.99.wav_ASR	well i just couldn't remember i can go down there and things like that and that at that time
UCL02a_485.795_3.66.wav_ASR	and somebody was talking to me and they were talking to me
UCL02a_489.477_2.9.wav_ASR	and i couldn't what they were talking to me
UCL02a_494.892_2.06.wav_ASR	and then a friend of mine firstnamee and she said
UCL02a_497.05_1.56.wav_ASR	oh yeah i'm gonna get you sort of well
UCL02a_499.0_1.51.wav_ASR	and she called
UCL02a_501.025_2.43.wav_ASR	you know what i'm not talking to them in the morning
UCL02a_503.787_2.13.wav_ASR	well we'll take it to the hospital firstnamea and eat it
UCL02a_507.338_1.89.wav_ASR	and i sat there for a couple of times while
UCL02a_509.25_2.01.wav_ASR	and then they calling for me for about an hour
UCL02a_512.02_0.421.wav_ASR	and i said
UCL02a_512.456_1.29.wav_ASR	and we're all going to school
UCL02a_513.77_1.31.wav_ASR	you know the other people and me
UCL02a_516.39_1.49.wav_ASR	at firstnamem you go outside
UCL02a_517.899_1.26.wav_ASR	and then i couldn't speak to them
UCL02a_519.178_1.81.wav_ASR	you know it was a bit rough around the bottom
UCL02a_522.583_7.091.wav_ASR	you know how to all of a sudden things like that and things like that and things like me
UCL02a_530.449_1.74.wav_ASR	and i couldn't speak to them
UCL02a_533.17_0.79.wav_ASR	and i couldn't speak
UCL02a_534.844_2.64.wav_ASR	when people were talking to me
UCL02a_537.5_1.32.wav_ASR	okay one word yes
UCL02a_539.744_1.17.wav_ASR	nothing was gone
UCL02a_542.169_5.25.wav_ASR	yeah i was here
UCL02a_547.468_1.91.wav_ASR	and of course there's about this time in the evening
UCL02a_549.43_5.87.wav_ASR	so then yeah at north northwestern military base the first day is well
UCL02a_555.32_1.53.wav_ASR	and then i said after that was about it
UCL02a_557.638_2.43.wav_ASR	and there's a five or six days hours
UCL02a_560.666_2.74.wav_ASR	and they moved me from there down here too
UCL02a_564.353_1.74.wav_ASR	it was hard for me
UCL02a_568.078_5.12.wav_ASR	and and that was it
UCL02a_573.219_1.35.wav_ASR	oh yeah i mean
UCL02a_575.827_0.89.wav_ASR	well i remember after that
UCL02a_576.741_1.01.wav_ASR	it's about five hours
UCL02a_577.773_1.11.wav_ASR	and that is bit
UCL02a_579.236_0.55.wav_ASR	they're gonna get me up
UCL02a_579.81_3.71.wav_ASR	it was right in the evening while in hospital
UCL02a_584.84_3.59.wav_ASR	and people were trying to write for me as well
UCL02a_588.451_4.45.wav_ASR	and it could be the my speaking was even worse than usual
UCL02a_593.524_2.64.wav_ASR	and the next day was well i just couldn't speak anyway
UCL02a_597.058_3.09.wav_ASR	and all the hospitals were there and looking at me other people up pop up
UCL02a_600.25_1.04.wav_ASR	and i couldn't

UCL02a_609.799_0.88.wav_ASR	well i couldn't speak
UCL02a_610.7_0.75.wav_ASR	well people look at it
UCL02a_611.467_0.48.wav_ASR	and i was like
UCL02a_613.201_2.54.wav_ASR	when people were talking to me
UCL02a_615.795_4.6.wav_ASR	and i couldn't speak to anyone

UCL02a_625.666_1.39.wav_ASR	and i couldn't speak anything well
UCL02a_628.52_4.16.wav_ASR	that's a firstnamew for about three or four weeks
UCL02a_632.699_1.28.wav_ASR	and i remember it was
UCL02a_634.0_2.21.wav_ASR	well we're staying around that at that hospital
UCL02a_637.869_2.91.wav_ASR	and then after that as well
UCL02a_640.8_0.48.wav_ASR	so yes
UCL02a_641.3_2.15.wav_ASR	so firstnamee is using your cellphone phone here
UCL02a_644.103_1.81.wav_ASR	and then this place is the ordering from him
UCL02a_646.0_0.38.wav_ASR	what is it
UCL02a_646.4_5.93.wav_ASR	the queen queens queens queens queens
UCL02a_652.975_4.0.wav_ASR	the neurologist you know
UCL02a_657.478_1.21.wav_ASR	that's off of two weeks ago
UCL02a_659.32_1.48.wav_ASR	and they tell him up and down i don't know
UCL02a_661.705_2.51.wav_ASR	so that's i'm not gonna say today
UCL02a_664.318_1.87.wav_ASR	that's the first day of the first stroke yeah
UCL02a_675.556_1.58.wav_ASR	that's not getting any better yeah
UCL02a_677.863_3.8.wav_ASR	it's strange
UCL02a_681.681_3.38.wav_ASR	because the next thing for me was two weeks after that
UCL02a_685.08_1.4.wav_ASR	well the first firstnamesu you know
UCL02a_686.5_1.06.wav_ASR	well we're going to school
UCL02a_687.622_3.32.wav_ASR	and then too early the neurologist
UCL02a_691.037_1.37.wav_ASR	well i kind of feel the first one is well
UCL02a_693.677_2.17.wav_ASR	well i remember there was the first one about two weeks
UCL02a_695.871_6.85.wav_ASR	and then there's some people were testing me up for physical fitness
UCL02a_704.304_2.18.wav_ASR	and somebody was the doctor
UCL02a_706.5_3.48.wav_ASR	there's lots of tests and me and things like that and yeah
UCL02a_712.938_1.25.wav_ASR	and she was test me
UCL02a_714.208_1.77.wav_ASR	and you know these photos of me
UCL02a_716.0_3.65.wav_ASR	and you know these cats
UCL02a_719.666_1.46.wav_ASR	two dogs and things like that
UCL02a_721.149_1.73.wav_ASR	and what's the other thing is me
UCL02a_723.85_4.47.wav_ASR	and sometimes i couldn't what she was talking about
UCL02a_728.336_1.86.wav_ASR	you know he's just sitting like the football thing
UCL02a_730.212_3.77.wav_ASR	there's a dog you know squirrels and i can't remember like that
UCL02a_738.114_2.95.wav_ASR	well after that about two weeks another place
UCL02a_741.126_4.6.wav_ASR	and then that was cold the stroke computer people was gone
UCL02a_747.398_2.78.wav_ASR	and the other thing was one group of people helping me up
UCL02a_750.539_5.96.wav_ASR	stroke people help me for writing some words with me while
UCL02a_757.561_3.75.wav_ASR	helping me use some words and maybe
UCL02a_761.331_3.15.wav_ASR	you know it's monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday saturday
UCL02a_764.5_1.42.wav_ASR	first day i couldn't tell him
UCL02a_766.211_2.02.wav_ASR	he's in monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday
UCL02a_768.626_0.55.wav_ASR	and i couldn't remember
UCL02a_769.252_0.9.wav_ASR	what is it monday day
UCL02a_770.176_1.63.wav_ASR	they can speak the word mom
UCL02a_772.961_6.7.wav_ASR	the first day second third fourth fifth sixth seventh eighth ninth tenth
UCL02a_779.679_0.83.wav_ASR	and i couldn't
UCL02a_781.953_1.63.wav_ASR	and i still have problems like that now
UCL02a_783.712_1.47.wav_ASR	one two three four five six seven eight nine ten one two three four five six
UCL02a_785.2_1.08.wav_ASR	you know what i'm doing is
UCL02a_786.37_3.78.wav_ASR	but i couldn't speak up
UCL02a_790.171_3.41.wav_ASR	you know what days
UCL02a_793.6_0.79.wav_ASR	well how am i
UCL02a_795.524_1.21.wav_ASR	well we're my going
UCL02a_796.901_1.38.wav_ASR	and i couldn't think what things are again
UCL02a_799.104_2.08.wav_ASR	that was difficult for me as well you know
UCL02a_801.24_3.72.wav_ASR	there was some people i suppose it was about
UCL02a_806.4_3.15.wav_ASR	as about six months she was there
UCL02a_810.46_2.21.wav_ASR	every week for me some lady was talking to me
UCL02a_812.693_6.05.wav_ASR	and you know reaching some words and helping out that that
UCL02a_818.791_1.44.wav_ASR	well i suppose that's about two weeks
UCL02a_821.718_4.68.wav_ASR	and then after that i says
UCL02a_826.419_1.74.wav_ASR	there's three weeks and then
UCL02a_828.767_2.69.wav_ASR	my six weeks or nine weeks yes
UCL02a_832.093_7.38.wav_ASR	and not on my mom's and then with you at ucl at aphasia
UCL02a_840.063_1.49.wav_ASR	that was the first test as well
UCL02a_841.662_2.74.wav_ASR	that was that
UCL02a_845.928_4.83.wav_ASR	you think for me you know with the stroke and the stroke i'll walk around
UCL02a_850.827_3.82.wav_ASR	well there's a big problem for me because you know and things like that
UCL02a_854.716_0.61.wav_ASR	that's okay
UCL02a_856.337_3.78.wav_ASR	you know by the bus and the shoe and things like that
UCL02a_860.14_0.69.wav_ASR	well i'll tell you
UCL02a_861.098_3.8.wav_ASR	you can't pick it by that you know but on the shoe by myself
UCL02a_865.175_1.64.wav_ASR	and not being able to help people was well
UCL02a_867.837_2.54.wav_ASR	that's about it for me
UCL02a_870.4_4.58.wav_ASR	and i think of some people that with the some people know we would be
UCL02a_875.2_1.96.wav_ASR	if you're by yourself it's a panic
UCL02a_877.224_0.68.wav_ASR	what is it called
UCL02a_878.342_1.19.wav_ASR	and it's a hospital
UCL02a_881.28_2.41.wav_ASR	can be worried for me sometimes
UCL02a_883.763_1.66.wav_ASR	but i'm not much better now
UCL02a_885.443_1.45.wav_ASR	but you can be terrible you know
UCL02a_887.833_4.93.wav_ASR	and that i'm talking about other people or you know
UCL02a_893.03_5.1.wav_ASR	but i suppose after that is better for me now
UCL02a_898.696_6.84.wav_ASR	but yeah i mean physically you're walking around
UCL02a_905.56_0.96.wav_ASR	and that's fine for me
UCL02a_907.365_2.52.wav_ASR	but it just you know is my own brain thing is wrong
UCL02a_909.992_0.51.wav_ASR	well let's go
UCL02a_911.188_1.79.wav_ASR	so make sense of it yeah
UCL02a_940.576_0.67.wav_ASR	see i'm sorry
UCL02a_941.493_0.61.wav_ASR	just say it again
UCL02a_942.392_1.14.wav_ASR	how'd you say it again
UCL02a_948.585_0.9.wav_ASR	what was the little kid
UCL02a_955.002_2.69.wav_ASR	when i'm a kid or when i useta kid
UCL02a_966.107_3.03.wav_ASR	then then what do they happen to me you know
UCL02a_971.144_7.25.wav_ASR	is that what what what was happening to me is a kid or yeah
UCL02a_978.444_0.75.wav_ASR	oh sorry
UCL02a_979.633_2.56.wav_ASR	two babies and things like that or not
UCL02a_986.138_3.38.wav_ASR	yeah and you know what is strange about the days as well
UCL02a_989.538_1.6.wav_ASR	what is it now fifteen eight
UCL02a_992.535_2.48.wav_ASR	but i was a kid when i was kids
UCL02a_995.033_0.71.wav_ASR	three years ago
UCL02a_995.761_5.8.wav_ASR	you mean i was about ten ten ten years ago
UCL02a_1002.376_7.93.wav_ASR	and i was looking because i was living in new yorks early as a kid
UCL02a_1010.322_6.55.wav_ASR	well i was born school in illinois but my dad had his job in italy as well
UCL02a_1017.003_0.78.wav_ASR	how to be back then
UCL02a_1018.974_1.8.wav_ASR	but firstnamesu took out of that thing happened as well
UCL02a_1020.913_2.78.wav_ASR	but i remember that was
UCL02a_1024.459_3.88.wav_ASR	they also had a journal of five years ago but then back to england
UCL02a_1029.03_3.799.wav_ASR	and then back to firstnamese was like
UCL02a_1033.867_3.061.wav_ASR	and i was trained at the state university
UCL02a_1038.126_1.02.wav_ASR	firstnamee it was wonderful
UCL02a_1039.807_0.56.wav_ASR	what's the key
UCL02a_1040.387_2.99.wav_ASR	we live in naples just outside of Naples
UCL02a_1044.069_3.01.wav_ASR	we had a few from the
UCL02a_1047.13_2.44.wav_ASR	for more than the difference she could see
UCL02a_1053.355_0.79.wav_ASR	versus firstnamesv
UCL02a_1054.307_0.36.wav_ASR	okay
UCL02a_1055.824_2.03.wav_ASR	vee us
UCL02a_1058.851_0.67.wav_ASR	you know that thing
UCL02a_1060.129_0.32.wav_ASR	oh my gosh
UCL02a_1061.36_1.67.wav_ASR	firstnamesv firstnamesv firstnamesv
UCL02a_1063.289_0.95.wav_ASR	can't be the word is
UCL02a_1064.257_1.25.wav_ASR	you know the big girl is
UCL02a_1066.615_3.45.wav_ASR	well i don't know about it as well
UCL02a_1070.089_2.69.wav_ASR	you know it was up to one of them being a kid up there
UCL02a_1072.85_4.61.wav_ASR	okay there was good while we live not far down from the beach
UCL02a_1077.477_6.2.wav_ASR	but then little kid walked around and people and this good
UCL02a_1083.7_1.68.wav_ASR	two years ago
UCL02a_1085.522_5.86.wav_ASR	but many time working with other people was
UCL02a_1091.399_3.32.wav_ASR	it was kind of nice as well because they're like some other people's personalities
UCL02a_1094.81_4.37.wav_ASR	but as a kid and living the many of atlanta kids is well
UCL02a_1099.196_0.39.wav_ASR	what is that
UCL02a_1099.601_1.44.wav_ASR	it's a little kid going up there
UCL02a_1101.086_0.74.wav_ASR	what's her name
UCL02a_1102.743_1.24.wav_ASR	that was wonderful for me
UCL02a_1104.0_0.87.wav_ASR	oh i really was lucky
UCL02a_1105.801_5.43.wav_ASR	and many times is well i remember was amazed
UCL02a_1111.66_5.83.wav_ASR	because i remember we lived in other part was no there of the
UCL02a_1119.401_0.9.wav_ASR	you know what i'm saying

UCL02a_1134.864_5.68.wav_ASR	another one too far away
UCL02a_1140.562_0.67.wav_ASR	and where is world war two
UCL02a_1141.249_0.33.wav_ASR	it was terrible
UCL02a_1141.6_0.78.wav_ASR	well call firstnamesk
UCL02a_1142.4_2.07.wav_ASR	well that's beautiful as well and going up there
UCL02a_1146.5_0.73.wav_ASR	it was beautiful
UCL02a_1147.45_3.91.wav_ASR	well i don't know if it's something was really good to me now or not

wright204a_132.539_1.42.wav_ASR	and then i went in and told my wife
wright204a_135.675_8.74.wav_ASR	because my motherinlaw had noticed that i had a little bit of swallow and that
wright204a_144.878_3.05.wav_ASR	so she immediately called the paramedics

wright204a_204.132_3.8.wav_ASR	which i understand is little bit less than half survive
wright204a_208.966_0.67.wav_ASR	and that was me
wright204a_210.501_0.9.wav_ASR	what was one of the luckiest
wright204a_212.664_5.3.wav_ASR	and i i was in three different hospitals
wright204a_218.922_5.15.wav_ASR	and really didn't come out of anything until about
wright204a_225.73_0.45.wav_ASR	oh let's see
wright204a_227.123_9.64.wav_ASR	we would say the middle of december just before christmas o'clock is when i remember really for the first time
wright204a_238.834_1.62.wav_ASR	it was out for a long time
wright204a_240.614_4.38.wav_ASR	they had all kinds of tests and

wright204a_255.308_1.49.wav_ASR	shoe that puts it
wright204a_258.047_5.38.wav_ASR	and from then on then i was at berkeley
wright204a_263.563_11.04.wav_ASR	and i remember all of them were all three of them speech therapy
wright204a_285.874_1.82.wav_ASR	well i'm not lost or too
wright204a_288.289_6.62.wav_ASR	my i hadta learn to use more my left hand then i wanted to
wright204a_295.072_5.09.wav_ASR	but i was paralyzed on the whole right side
wright204a_301.173_1.18.wav_ASR	for quite a long time
wright204a_303.069_4.89.wav_ASR	when i got out of the hospital for the third time i was in a wheelchair
wright204a_315.318_2.19.wav_ASR	you know they were all from one to the other
wright204a_318.564_0.31.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_319.489_15.42.wav_ASR	so firstnamer from oregon i was in hospital for almost a month i was in the hospital
wright204a_337.032_3.05.wav_ASR	because we had different problems
wright204a_340.132_1.81.wav_ASR	and i had firstnamese
wright204a_343.379_4.39.wav_ASR	well i don't remember anything that i don't even remember
wright204a_348.779_3.78.wav_ASR	and so it took a long time just to get out of the hospital
wright204a_353.142_6.05.wav_ASR	but i was home in the december january
wright204a_360.553_13.81.wav_ASR	firstnamer and firstnamem firstnamem firstnamem firstnamej at firstnamem firstnamec at firstnamem firstnamej
wright204a_375.474_6.3.wav_ASR	well i've been there for the last two or three years
wright204a_391.134_0.65.wav_ASR	that's correct
wright204a_400.899_0.38.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_423.934_1.43.wav_ASR	and she's all jeez
wright204a_426.385_3.17.wav_ASR	well i had a very good life
wright204a_430.939_2.71.wav_ASR	oh well i don't know
wright204a_434.419_0.39.wav_ASR	very
wright204a_435.869_1.32.wav_ASR	that was the firstnamer
wright204a_437.931_2.89.wav_ASR	my first child was a big baby
wright204a_441.696_4.35.wav_ASR	well my second third floors were
wright204a_448.445_4.81.wav_ASR	we just had her fifty years ago this first stroke
wright204a_454.55_4.98.wav_ASR	well it'll be a year in march april april
wright204a_460.255_1.8.wav_ASR	we're our first firstnamesp firstnamesp firstnamesp
wright204a_462.698_3.202.wav_ASR	oh there's lots of things you know
wright204a_466.905_2.09.wav_ASR	and i had a good life as a child
wright204a_469.055_1.22.wav_ASR	it was an only child
wright204a_471.226_6.03.wav_ASR	well i don't really know what to say
wright204a_488.482_2.61.wav_ASR	well i don't know if they're going to school or not
wright204a_551.677_4.2.wav_ASR	the little boy is playing with a soccer ball i guess
wright204a_556.512_3.27.wav_ASR	and he happens to hit the window
wright204a_562.435_1.63.wav_ASR	and he goes in
wright204a_564.087_8.98.wav_ASR	and it the guy is hiding in the picture is sitting down
wright204a_573.142_3.66.wav_ASR	and it hits them at least it comes in the window
wright204a_577.402_1.19.wav_ASR	so he's got class
wright204a_579.694_1.82.wav_ASR	and he goes
wright204a_581.882_2.06.wav_ASR	and he looks at the window
wright204a_583.994_0.79.wav_ASR	you have the ball
wright204a_584.804_8.2.wav_ASR	and apparently he's going out to see what happened and maybe let the ball go back to the jelly jelly
wright204a_611.342_0.53.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_612.361_1.49.wav_ASR	looks like it's ready for school
wright204a_614.634_3.67.wav_ASR	and she says looks like he might wanna take the umbrella
wright204a_619.559_2.09.wav_ASR	and she's probably just said okay
wright204a_623.716_0.88.wav_ASR	did she say
wright204a_625.692_0.59.wav_ASR	maybe not
wright204a_626.402_0.35.wav_ASR	don't know
wright204a_626.8_2.35.wav_ASR	because now he's going to school
wright204a_629.803_0.94.wav_ASR	oh no it isn't
wright204a_630.763_0.47.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_633.482_1.14.wav_ASR	and she says
wright204a_634.899_1.17.wav_ASR	oh i don't think i need it
wright204a_637.004_1.53.wav_ASR	oh god
wright204a_639.482_1.63.wav_ASR	and he must be waiting for the bus
wright204a_641.129_1.2.wav_ASR	and it's fighting the rain
wright204a_642.924_2.12.wav_ASR	so now it's coming down pretty good
wright204a_645.498_1.72.wav_ASR	so he goes back to the house
wright204a_647.796_0.36.wav_ASR	and he says
wright204a_648.654_0.66.wav_ASR	well i'm all wet
wright204a_650.019_0.33.wav_ASR	and he says
wright204a_651.289_1.3.wav_ASR	you know i'd better take the umbrella
wright204a_672.485_0.54.wav_ASR	what's her name
wright204a_677.959_4.91.wav_ASR	looks like the problem is the cat is stuck up in a tree
wright204a_683.65_0.4.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_685.27_2.21.wav_ASR	father is out on the
wright204a_687.552_3.18.wav_ASR	well and he's kinda stuck himself i think
wright204a_691.424_2.46.wav_ASR	the little girl is crying for the cat
wright204a_694.509_1.57.wav_ASR	oh she got a umbrella

wright204a_709.619_2.69.wav_ASR	you know she was trying to get this ladder or not
wright204a_712.623_1.35.wav_ASR	you know i'm not aware about that
wright204a_715.021_2.4.wav_ASR	well let's see
wright204a_717.541_1.03.wav_ASR	firetruck is there
wright204a_718.865_6.08.wav_ASR	and they're coming out with a ladder perhaps to help get the cat and father out of there
wright204a_729.715_0.44.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_730.298_1.47.wav_ASR	well that's that's a real picture
wright204a_733.872_5.81.wav_ASR	well this is a pretty a flood stroke
wright204a_740.511_1.38.wav_ASR	well really right here and iran
wright204a_744.599_3.77.wav_ASR	the girl was probably washed down the river
wright204a_749.301_2.17.wav_ASR	and this is her rescue
wright204a_752.238_8.31.wav_ASR	and she is hitting on a branch that they're trying to get her to sail
wright204a_764.718_0.38.wav_ASR	okay
