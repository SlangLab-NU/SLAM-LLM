fridriksson07a_1203.12_4.56.wav_ASR	so then they ask cinderella to try it
fridriksson07a_1207.7_1.21.wav_ASR	and and they were just
fridriksson07a_1209.733_1.54.wav_ASR	oh no she wasn't even there

kansas04a_68.079_9.21.wav_ASR	and she said that i drove too close to cars and i had difficulty with my speech
kansas04a_77.957_5.16.wav_ASR	and i went home and i met my husband at the local watering hole
kansas04a_84.83_3.35.wav_ASR	and had a drink and i went home
kansas04a_88.529_5.344.wav_ASR	that was not my usual way of doing
kansas04a_95.153_1.87.wav_ASR	don't talk to anybody or anything
kansas04a_97.072_3.29.wav_ASR	and so i went home and i went to bed that night
kansas04a_100.589_2.91.wav_ASR	and i got up the next morning and went to work
kansas04a_104.276_4.63.wav_ASR	went to a a chamber meeting
kansas04a_109.508_10.63.wav_ASR	and i parked and went in and when i came back out i noticed that i parked very badly
kansas04a_121.372_4.48.wav_ASR	and i went to work and then one of the girls came in and said
kansas04a_126.873_2.64.wav_ASR	you're not using your arm correctly
kansas04a_131.007_0.4.wav_ASR	alright
kansas04a_131.688_1.2.wav_ASR	and i think i'm having a stroke
kansas04a_133.315_0.93.wav_ASR	call the doctors
kansas04a_134.744_8.79.wav_ASR	and she told me to go to the emergency room and not to drive
kansas04a_144.096_13.82.wav_ASR	and at that point i was confused enough that i was thinking about the ambulance across the street at home and not one across the street from my office
kansas04a_158.827_1.8.wav_ASR	so i think i'd drive myself
kansas04a_161.92_1.11.wav_ASR	so i drove myself
kansas04a_163.284_3.31.wav_ASR	and i got out there parked in the parking lot
kansas04a_167.312_3.2.wav_ASR	and went in and and then i met my husband there
kansas04a_170.986_6.08.wav_ASR	and i told him to tell them what what i thought
kansas04a_177.562_3.58.wav_ASR	because i could not communicate at that point
kansas04a_182.356_4.06.wav_ASR	and i was there for overnight and they sent me home
kansas04a_187.406_9.41.wav_ASR	and then i did not feel well the next morning so i i had him take me back to the hospital and i stayed for couple of weeks
kansas04a_207.011_5.1.wav_ASR	well i had therapy in on my speech and writing
kansas04a_213.604_6.17.wav_ASR	but they didn't give it to me for very long
kansas04a_220.931_5.04.wav_ASR	mean i i was in the hospital and i had my speech and writing therapy
kansas04a_226.382_3.15.wav_ASR	and then i got home and had some physical therapy
kansas04a_259.052_0.729.wav_ASR	thank you
kansas04a_263.423_8.6.wav_ASR	well when i got married the first time i hadta plan my whole wedding myself because mom was much older
kansas04a_273.102_2.34.wav_ASR	and she left it up to me
kansas04a_276.529_5.33.wav_ASR	and i went home and then went back to london
kansas04a_281.881_3.75.wav_ASR	and i got married and firstnamel in danforth chapter
kansas04a_294.955_9.48.wav_ASR	and we had dinner and then we went to back to the hotel
kansas04a_304.94_3.42.wav_ASR	and my uncle married me
kansas04a_309.335_2.86.wav_ASR	he's a magnificent minister
kansas04a_313.018_7.98.wav_ASR	and his wife took over the bathroom didn't get let my sister or i in there
kansas04a_322.108_15.2.wav_ASR	and so then we went to the chapel and on the way my brother inlaw was driving and he almost rectified
kansas04a_342.23_1.91.wav_ASR	and i think that will be enough for that story
kansas04a_369.621_4.36.wav_ASR	well this little boy is practicing his soccer ball
kansas04a_376.048_2.66.wav_ASR	and then he kicks it through the window
kansas04a_379.812_1.49.wav_ASR	and it breaks the window
kansas04a_382.375_3.03.wav_ASR	and it goes into this man's house
kansas04a_386.256_1.9.wav_ASR	and he's very startled
kansas04a_389.349_6.47.wav_ASR	and he gets up and looks out the window to see where it came from
kansas04a_396.096_10.7.wav_ASR	now it does not tell you whether the boy ran away or whether he came and confess that he had kicked the soccer ball
kansas04a_435.24_4.79.wav_ASR	mother wants the little boy to take the umbrella
kansas04a_443.068_1.73.wav_ASR	it doesn't want to take the umbrella
kansas04a_446.585_4.68.wav_ASR	so he goes out and it starts to rain of course as his mother had told him it would
kansas04a_452.243_1.56.wav_ASR	so he goes back
kansas04a_454.24_0.91.wav_ASR	and she tells him
kansas04a_455.171_1.15.wav_ASR	and he's very wet
kansas04a_457.426_5.56.wav_ASR	so we goes back in the house and she's very angry with him because he hasn't taken the umbrella
kansas04a_463.777_7.44.wav_ASR	so in the last picture he has the umbrella and it's up and he's walking very happily
kansas04a_506.81_1.84.wav_ASR	well the cat is in the tree
kansas04a_510.155_1.81.wav_ASR	dog is barking at the cat
kansas04a_513.126_4.38.wav_ASR	and the little girl is crying because her cat is in the tree
kansas04a_519.099_8.07.wav_ASR	and her father tried to get it with a ladder and the ladder has fallen down
kansas04a_527.276_4.41.wav_ASR	and the father is still in the tree looking very gloomy
kansas04a_532.649_2.56.wav_ASR	and the birds are singing
kansas04a_537.485_4.46.wav_ASR	that's rather unclear as everything else is going on
kansas04a_542.482_5.22.wav_ASR	and the firemen have been called and they are going to hafta get the cat down
kansas04a_547.988_3.8.wav_ASR	but i think before they do they'll hafta get daddy down
kansas04a_576.487_1.57.wav_ASR	there's been a flood
kansas04a_582.466_4.23.wav_ASR	and this lady has been swept away in the flood
kansas04a_590.504_12.69.wav_ASR	and this gentleman in the jacket is coming to rescue her
kansas04a_604.912_6.77.wav_ASR	he's been swept away in the flood also looks to me
kansas04a_613.723_13.02.wav_ASR	and i do not quite understand this part
kansas04a_634.622_1.22.wav_ASR	yeah i think i am
kansas04a_636.851_1.21.wav_ASR	you know what is that
kansas04a_643.48_6.31.wav_ASR	yeah but which one is being rescued and which one isn't
kansas04a_661.844_0.6.wav_ASR	oh yes
kansas04a_668.087_0.84.wav_ASR	not terrible
kansas04a_688.588_0.82.wav_ASR	okay
kansas04a_756.402_5.91.wav_ASR	the story is about cinderella and her wicked stepmother and her two half sisters
kansas04a_762.492_0.68.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
kansas04a_763.997_11.67.wav_ASR	her stepsisters were very unhappy to her and her stepmother was too
kansas04a_776.051_5.38.wav_ASR	umbrella was left to sweep and clean and do whatever they wanted done
kansas04a_782.592_7.02.wav_ASR	so they got a letter inviting the the ball
kansas04a_791.424_5.37.wav_ASR	the mother said that cinderella could not go
kansas04a_798.1_1.62.wav_ASR	and she was very upset
kansas04a_800.608_12.89.wav_ASR	and so she tried to get her dress together and the two stepsisters tore it apart
kansas04a_815.132_22.74.wav_ASR	so she went out and told her fairy godmother that they had torn it apart and she wasn't going to go
kansas04a_837.925_6.54.wav_ASR	and and the fairy godmother said yes she could
kansas04a_845.377_4.79.wav_ASR	they got her dressed and and with her wand of course
kansas04a_850.747_14.83.wav_ASR	and so the stepmother stepmother and stepchildren started out and she did not go with them
kansas04a_865.963_15.24.wav_ASR	but she went in the carriage that the fairy godmother had coached out of a pumpkin and mice and horse
kansas04a_881.57_0.95.wav_ASR	horse
kansas04a_883.45_2.91.wav_ASR	and she went to the ball
kansas04a_887.004_4.42.wav_ASR	and the prince greeted her at the ball
kansas04a_892.03_1.55.wav_ASR	and they dance
kansas04a_893.647_1.85.wav_ASR	and then it was a twelve o'clock
kansas04a_895.645_2.1.wav_ASR	he hadta be home by twelve o'clock
kansas04a_897.799_2.56.wav_ASR	so she ran out and lost her slipper
kansas04a_901.571_7.85.wav_ASR	and she went and got the carriage and of course the carriage all collapsed
kansas04a_909.825_1.47.wav_ASR	and she went home
kansas04a_912.607_9.82.wav_ASR	and then the following week or so time approx
kansas04a_922.783_10.71.wav_ASR	the footman was set out with the slipper to find which girl in the kingdom had fit
kansas04a_934.46_7.29.wav_ASR	and she was locked in her room so she could not get to the come down
kansas04a_942.65_2.64.wav_ASR	and she was very upset
kansas04a_946.239_4.44.wav_ASR	and that's it
kansas04a_952.096_3.38.wav_ASR	and anyway the the the mice cinderella
kansas04a_957.72_3.9.wav_ASR	and she came down and and of course she fit the slipper
kansas04a_962.075_1.87.wav_ASR	but the other did not

kansas04a_995.9_4.73.wav_ASR	and spread the jelly on the same piece of bread
kansas04a_1001.062_1.38.wav_ASR	and then put the top on it
kansas04a_1005.16_3.55.wav_ASR	oh yes i've practiced

kansas05a_674.141_4.53.wav_ASR	looking at the tear tears again and again
kansas05a_681.195_14.69.wav_ASR	and and believing that the second people should
kansas05a_702.031_0.71.wav_ASR	thank you
kansas05a_703.736_3.14.wav_ASR	he he's not sposta do that for him
kansas05a_708.008_3.8.wav_ASR	but this one guy wants the these birds to come down
kansas05a_712.325_1.15.wav_ASR	or he wants it by himself
kansas05a_715.293_1.03.wav_ASR	it's not quite right but
kansas05a_718.205_0.34.wav_ASR	what
kansas05a_719.0_0.38.wav_ASR	witch
kansas05a_721.863_10.62.wav_ASR	there he's looking out a four on the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the
kansas05a_732.528_5.87.wav_ASR	and the the old stuff that that's been ahead there
kansas05a_740.616_16.13.wav_ASR	the the the mother is not not happy with her her person of what went all the the the little problems that they look here together
kansas05a_759.633_4.72.wav_ASR	well he then he was back there again
kansas05a_764.921_0.88.wav_ASR	oh i see
kansas05a_766.03_12.56.wav_ASR	his mother wanted him to go back to the good stuff he was done before so that he could go back on to this this kind of stuff again that makes him look better

kansas05a_812.463_2.81.wav_ASR	well i guess she's started with that
kansas05a_819.976_6.9.wav_ASR	people sitting with their they're they're messed up around
kansas05a_827.928_1.1.wav_ASR	one two his
kansas05a_831.043_4.35.wav_ASR	again the kind of a bicycle people there
kansas05a_837.143_11.29.wav_ASR	well let's see there's the the man who's trying to talk with him about that back over to that kind of stuff
kansas05a_848.486_4.42.wav_ASR	it was going to be overly cared by this young young stuff
kansas05a_854.133_3.71.wav_ASR	is big enough to make that kind of stuff
kansas05a_859.378_4.24.wav_ASR	then they're be this thing doesn't really
kansas05a_864.8_5.88.wav_ASR	the isn't necessarily what's going on here but it's there
kansas05a_872.161_11.16.wav_ASR	here's the the the leave leave
kansas05a_888.045_3.84.wav_ASR	the person's putting this stuff together
kansas05a_893.315_5.28.wav_ASR	he's got a person ready to help him with that
kansas05a_899.503_11.32.wav_ASR	here's information to him from the the people down stairs trying to put this together with a new set
kansas05a_911.256_10.74.wav_ASR	here's the young person who's trying to put that money back back here so it goes wherever and all of these things
kansas05a_922.725_3.13.wav_ASR	and then there is a national

202-2_2417.585_2.25.wav_ASR	and and the
71-1_11.65_2.76.wav_ASR	oh my goodness
71-1_14.65_0.62.wav_ASR	oh it'd be
71-1_16.35_1.349.wav_ASR	we would be the one to bring up
71-1_17.699_11.7.wav_ASR	you know i could just talk about the year that well nine months really when i was living in kootenay and when i was nineteen
71-1_29.979_4.84.wav_ASR	and i did a semester
71-1_38.11_8.87.wav_ASR	back in my generation you could actually go for two semesters which is what i did which was nine months
71-1_47.68_7.67.wav_ASR	but what i did when i got to kootenay and we had this arrangement which you could take classes at the university
71-1_56.18_2.36.wav_ASR	for the first semester i took class
71-1_59.16_2.453.wav_ASR	we had classes for four days of the week
71-1_61.8_1.661.wav_ASR	and three days of the week we could travel
71-1_64.1_7.4.wav_ASR	the second semester because i met this woman who became my best friend and it was her idea she said
71-1_71.94_4.16.wav_ASR	you know we are our education is really holding us back
71-1_76.94_18.32.wav_ASR	so i think what we should do is we should we should with draw from the university take our tuition money because we get most of it if you with with draw from the first week but put it in during the second week and then just spend the time traveling
71-1_95.93_13.06.wav_ASR	so i would say for those four months in which i actually had a dormitory room that i could go back to when i needed to depress and i got the umbrella
71-1_110.29_3.419.wav_ASR	umbrella as far south as we go
71-1_113.771_4.08.wav_ASR	italy france scottland
71-1_119.131_2.676.wav_ASR	we spent a fair amount of time a time traveling all over
71-1_121.911_2.231.wav_ASR	when you're nineteen it's a really good time to travel
71-1_124.491_2.854.wav_ASR	really good looking boys everywhere that you go
71-1_127.345_11.955.wav_ASR	yeah i just had the most incredible large vacation depending on the fact that my mother said
71-1_139.525_1.2.wav_ASR	topping out the school
71-1_140.804_1.257.wav_ASR	oh that's terrible
71-1_142.165_0.882.wav_ASR	you will go back
71-1_143.59_1.381.wav_ASR	oh no i go back next spring
71-1_144.971_4.28.wav_ASR	oh but this is my opportunity to really travel
71-1_149.791_2.56.wav_ASR	yeah as my friend firstnamem said to me
71-1_153.351_1.62.wav_ASR	april's back in washington
71-1_155.291_0.913.wav_ASR	what are they gonna do
71-1_156.204_0.947.wav_ASR	we're in kootenay
71-1_157.791_1.89.wav_ASR	we're just gonna tell them what we're doing
71-1_160.22_5.0.wav_ASR	so i could tell you other stories but they wouldn't really be sentences
71-1_165.44_2.1.wav_ASR	so we went to all the details
71-1_174.46_3.52.wav_ASR	it say it was iron because i met my father
71-1_178.1_6.44.wav_ASR	my father's family was only two generations from emerging to the united states
71-1_184.94_5.88.wav_ASR	and they're in brownstone which is in the western county of galway
71-1_191.32_5.02.wav_ASR	and so i actually meet with other cousins second cousins
71-1_196.572_2.608.wav_ASR	that's what the exact relationship is
71-1_199.432_1.95.wav_ASR	but i met people that were part of my family
71-1_201.692_7.006.wav_ASR	and i'd uncle or second or third cousins that looked exactly like my father and my uncle
71-1_209.352_4.804.wav_ASR	well yeah that was the little bit on the spending i think yeah
71-1_236.89_0.84.wav_ASR	it comes and goes
71-1_238.25_4.65.wav_ASR	and i would say that the main problem with my language is that it's unreliable
71-1_243.73_5.13.wav_ASR	as i said a few minutes ago i was talking about going
71-1_249.84_4.21.wav_ASR	and what's interesting is that it's the values that i have issues with
71-1_254.46_2.14.wav_ASR	oh i could not say a word
71-1_257.12_1.089.wav_ASR	oh i think i said a bro
71-1_258.58_0.629.wav_ASR	then i said
71-1_259.68_6.89.wav_ASR	but i was really thinking in my brain how to walk around that or figure that out or feel that out
71-1_267.01_2.96.wav_ASR	and i can think of a few words
71-1_270.27_1.84.wav_ASR	and i didn't appreciate that happening
71-1_272.61_2.16.wav_ASR	oh i better than i was
71-1_275.11_5.22.wav_ASR	and i still have difficulty with complicated conjugations
71-1_281.15_1.54.wav_ASR	still
71-1_282.906_4.581.wav_ASR	not that i have been always been confusing to other people
71-1_287.466_3.295.wav_ASR	and i do remember back what it was like when i was painting before the stroke
71-1_291.106_1.62.wav_ASR	and people would look puzzled
71-1_293.566_0.577.wav_ASR	and then it was like
71-1_294.446_0.82.wav_ASR	what's their problem
71-1_295.586_5.857.wav_ASR	one they look puzzled a lot of times because i said something that didn't make any sense
71-1_301.443_11.647.wav_ASR	so i'm still trying to work on explaining complicated things to people and trying to correct myself when i make mistakes
71-1_313.523_6.04.wav_ASR	and i do continue my speech on a regular basis
71-1_319.736_1.86.wav_ASR	so it's frustrating
71-1_321.916_8.864.wav_ASR	but i keep practicing it to the point that many people don't think i have aphasia until they do notice that i have aphasia
71-1_331.276_5.44.wav_ASR	so i can communicate but not well and not the way that i useta be able to communicate
71-1_347.09_0.959.wav_ASR	oh very much
71-1_348.131_1.199.wav_ASR	umbrella umbrella
71-1_350.191_0.82.wav_ASR	oh yeah
71-1_357.66_4.863.wav_ASR	well i didn't know that it was a stroke with is very tight
71-1_363.04_1.71.wav_ASR	and then i had one more before
71-1_364.78_1.964.wav_ASR	so how would i know what a stroke is
71-1_366.88_4.114.wav_ASR	oh i was excellent working out
71-1_371.1_1.984.wav_ASR	it was january
71-1_373.42_4.0.wav_ASR	you know that's the day when you know that's the day when the resurrection stopped
71-1_377.8_1.688.wav_ASR	so i don't have to get out there
71-1_379.52_2.533.wav_ASR	and i needta start working out again harder than i've been
71-1_382.16_0.893.wav_ASR	and i was at his house
71-1_384.16_2.555.wav_ASR	and i worked the hell out man
71-1_386.84_1.385.wav_ASR	mean i think i did eight miles
71-1_388.82_3.88.wav_ASR	my heart rate was up to a hundred and seven
71-1_393.18_0.64.wav_ASR	and going
71-1_394.24_0.819.wav_ASR	and you keep this up
71-1_395.34_2.9.wav_ASR	yeah i and i wasn't tired
71-1_398.62_0.92.wav_ASR	it wasn't fourteen
71-1_400.16_11.482.wav_ASR	and i got off the electric and had double vision and then divided i would walk for two more miles mostly because the black panther was on
71-1_412.0_1.26.wav_ASR	oh well
71-1_413.3_0.677.wav_ASR	but that was on
71-1_413.977_4.84.wav_ASR	and i thought i wanted to watch it because really like chat with
71-1_419.837_1.766.wav_ASR	oh i'm watching tv
71-1_422.137_2.144.wav_ASR	and again i had double vision
71-1_425.157_2.023.wav_ASR	oh i just didn't feel good anymore
71-1_427.66_7.131.wav_ASR	went home and had a thunder clap headache right on my right side
71-1_434.94_0.52.wav_ASR	and i said
71-1_435.94_1.381.wav_ASR	oh no idea what that
71-1_437.76_2.145.wav_ASR	so i of course enrolled it and went to the school
71-1_440.66_2.93.wav_ASR	the next day i couldn't work it on
71-1_443.78_1.7.wav_ASR	it's trying to write a conference proposal
71-1_445.86_0.64.wav_ASR	nothing would
71-1_446.77_1.3.wav_ASR	and i couldn't do
71-1_449.31_3.735.wav_ASR	so i went to get my hair cut the next day
71-1_453.11_3.247.wav_ASR	and i wanted to canvas because i had a really bad headache
71-1_456.67_2.13.wav_ASR	but if you hadta pay for it
71-1_459.29_1.889.wav_ASR	and my hair it be cut
71-1_461.93_0.942.wav_ASR	oh i
71-1_462.93_1.662.wav_ASR	and i live alone
71-1_464.592_2.463.wav_ASR	so i didn't really talk to anybody in two days
71-1_467.512_1.658.wav_ASR	yeah i'm i'm in the chair
71-1_469.572_2.734.wav_ASR	and i couldn't tell her how i wanted to get my hair cut
71-1_473.192_2.18.wav_ASR	and i couldn't say
71-1_476.352_4.42.wav_ASR	so i couldn't tell her that i'd been wearing slippers
71-1_481.512_1.76.wav_ASR	and i don't know what was coming
71-1_483.692_0.608.wav_ASR	and i was told
71-1_484.66_2.06.wav_ASR	and she's like nodding and smiling
71-1_486.78_1.691.wav_ASR	but she had no idea what i was talking
71-1_489.8_0.46.wav_ASR	oh i see
71-1_490.62_1.01.wav_ASR	oh something's wrong
71-1_492.54_1.8.wav_ASR	so i told them
71-1_494.62_0.3.wav_ASR	and i said
71-1_495.129_0.678.wav_ASR	like your hair
71-1_497.02_2.56.wav_ASR	so she luckily she didn't have h t
71-1_499.94_1.89.wav_ASR	but she cut her hair the way i
71-1_502.08_0.3.wav_ASR	and i said
71-1_502.46_3.93.wav_ASR	you know better go call a doctor because this doesn't make any sense
71-1_507.5_2.1.wav_ASR	so i i i
71-1_510.16_4.24.wav_ASR	and i think this is something that must happen with people that have strokes is that they
71-1_516.46_3.62.wav_ASR	up the number that i was sposta call emergency
71-1_520.22_1.589.wav_ASR	and this was already six thirteen
71-1_522.35_2.64.wav_ASR	and it had all of these
71-1_526.21_3.46.wav_ASR	if it's an immediate emergency go call nineoneone
71-1_530.13_0.33.wav_ASR	and i thought
71-1_530.61_0.757.wav_ASR	that's it
71-1_531.59_3.737.wav_ASR	just to make an appointment and go into the emergency room
71-1_536.11_0.706.wav_ASR	and then i said
71-1_537.11_3.2.wav_ASR	if it's this situation call
71-1_540.703_4.014.wav_ASR	and if it's this situation call you know press three
71-1_545.023_2.16.wav_ASR	if it's this situation call
71-1_548.083_3.82.wav_ASR	and apparently if you stayed on for two and a half minutes they finally say
71-1_552.343_1.811.wav_ASR	real person will come on the line
71-1_555.283_1.601.wav_ASR	but my head really hurt
71-1_557.243_0.593.wav_ASR	and i'm just going
71-1_557.903_1.16.wav_ASR	well this isn't
71-1_559.46_2.24.wav_ASR	so i hung up the phone and said
71-1_561.9_1.13.wav_ASR	oh just get up to my own
71-1_563.38_2.36.wav_ASR	and i'll see if i anybody will answer the phone
71-1_566.68_1.06.wav_ASR	but i told my daughter
71-1_568.34_4.12.wav_ASR	and she she was very frightened
71-1_573.0_0.6.wav_ASR	excuse me
71-1_573.7_1.12.wav_ASR	don't sound like yourself
71-1_576.13_1.22.wav_ASR	you needta go take an ambulance
71-1_577.9_1.29.wav_ASR	and i'm gonna pay for it
71-1_579.24_0.78.wav_ASR	it's just ridiculous
71-1_580.52_1.22.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
71-1_581.84_0.82.wav_ASR	and just have a headache
71-1_582.9_2.28.wav_ASR	and i don't wanna spend that much money
71-1_586.02_6.16.wav_ASR	and she and her partner they call the fire department
71-1_592.48_0.8.wav_ASR	he's in the middle of the umbrella
71-1_593.56_2.263.wav_ASR	and she's just finishing school up there
71-1_596.04_2.585.wav_ASR	but she they call the fire department in madison
71-1_598.625_1.419.wav_ASR	and and they said
71-1_601.165_2.74.wav_ASR	perfect this is perfect
71-1_604.725_1.16.wav_ASR	three this is her sister
71-1_606.385_0.335.wav_ASR	and they said
71-1_607.54_1.23.wav_ASR	it seems like she's having a stroke
71-1_609.285_2.315.wav_ASR	and she needs to get to the emergency
71-1_613.76_1.04.wav_ASR	and and they said
71-1_614.845_1.205.wav_ASR	but she doesn't wanna go
71-1_616.36_0.52.wav_ASR	and they said
71-1_616.96_5.542.wav_ASR	all of a sudden i know is i'm living on my you know getting ready to teach something
71-1_623.14_4.643.wav_ASR	and i hear people running up the stairs outside my apartment
71-1_628.28_4.927.wav_ASR	man just over these really good looking firemen
71-1_633.62_2.12.wav_ASR	it it must be the university
71-1_636.04_0.645.wav_ASR	and that's the whole
71-1_637.365_1.928.wav_ASR	and i answered the door
71-1_639.285_1.265.wav_ASR	and i told them that
71-1_640.825_1.38.wav_ASR	oh i didn't have
71-1_642.545_1.252.wav_ASR	they didn't know what was going on
71-1_644.165_1.173.wav_ASR	but i couldn't talk
71-1_646.805_1.205.wav_ASR	you needta come with us right now
71-1_648.285_0.355.wav_ASR	and i said
71-1_648.745_0.913.wav_ASR	well no i'll take it
71-1_650.705_0.335.wav_ASR	and they said
71-1_651.417_0.908.wav_ASR	you can't drive
71-1_653.105_1.585.wav_ASR	well i'm gonna go to that
71-1_654.885_1.437.wav_ASR	oh you're gonna go with this right now
71-1_656.32_0.62.wav_ASR	oh my god
71-1_657.32_0.817.wav_ASR	alright
71-1_658.28_2.28.wav_ASR	let's think let me get my coat and all the other stuff
71-1_660.88_3.715.wav_ASR	yeah all of a sudden i got into the emergency room
71-1_664.74_1.961.wav_ASR	it was just this huge
71-1_667.8_1.86.wav_ASR	it's racing around and jelly
71-1_670.22_6.1.wav_ASR	and all of a sudden they held me in for a cat scan and came out and said
71-1_676.5_1.02.wav_ASR	yeah you had a stroke
71-1_678.32_2.727.wav_ASR	so i asked the doctor
71-1_681.06_3.681.wav_ASR	and he showed me on the cat scan exactly what it had happened
71-1_685.44_3.23.wav_ASR	and they edit
71-1_689.38_2.962.wav_ASR	so that's i found out i had a stroke
71-1_692.75_6.56.wav_ASR	yeah i i i really have had no issues what's so ever with mice mouse feet work
71-1_699.81_1.65.wav_ASR	but i had my own
71-1_702.78_2.04.wav_ASR	and i just didn't know about the headache
71-1_705.03_0.95.wav_ASR	we've ever had one again
71-1_706.88_1.18.wav_ASR	never have fun
71-1_708.53_7.93.wav_ASR	but apparently if you get a really really bad headache that hits you on the side of the head it means you should probably go to the emergency room
71-1_717.45_2.54.wav_ASR	oh i don't know if that gave you
71-1_720.582_1.363.wav_ASR	it doesn't give you a lot of insight
71-1_722.34_8.435.wav_ASR	again if i remember right right after i had worked out when i had the headache it was horrible that they could have stopped it
71-1_731.3_3.77.wav_ASR	but at point the window of opportunity had this
71-1_737.18_5.617.wav_ASR	but it wasn't a a scream it was an a scream stroke not a hemorrhagic stroke
71-1_743.84_6.846.wav_ASR	and they ultimately decided it was critical because they've not been able to find out why i had it
71-1_751.22_7.24.wav_ASR	all of my numbers are medical numbers or good
71-1_758.94_0.8.wav_ASR	and not die back
71-1_760.32_0.82.wav_ASR	oh i don't smoke
71-1_762.02_1.88.wav_ASR	and i have a little blood pressure
71-1_764.42_2.25.wav_ASR	everything looks
71-1_767.76_1.39.wav_ASR	but i did indeed have a stroke
71-1_769.54_2.64.wav_ASR	so something happens
71-1_772.78_3.16.wav_ASR	and and in the hospital i got to watch the insurance
71-1_776.46_0.954.wav_ASR	and it's
71-1_780.18_0.96.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
71-1_781.58_4.48.wav_ASR	so yeah so two years later here
71-1_797.2_17.56.wav_ASR	well again and if i ever get to the point that i'm articulate enough about this i'm going to use my physical science expertise and and research and do something more about getting people some kind of treatment
71-1_814.772_2.553.wav_ASR	but i was given almost nothing
71-1_817.552_3.086.wav_ASR	partly i think it was because
71-1_820.772_2.485.wav_ASR	it really mad as hell because of the major situation
71-1_823.472_6.42.wav_ASR	so i should have been able to get the best type of help
71-1_830.372_0.477.wav_ASR	and i did
71-1_830.849_4.78.wav_ASR	the best i could get was we found two speech therapists
71-1_836.569_2.232.wav_ASR	one of them only specialized in children
71-1_839.189_1.351.wav_ASR	so i didn't work with
71-1_840.909_0.92.wav_ASR	the other person
71-1_842.229_4.18.wav_ASR	it was really one hour a week
71-1_847.59_16.523.wav_ASR	and basically because i am an accident because that part of my brain wasn't interested with it anyway i hadta do my own research
71-1_864.29_2.08.wav_ASR	hadta do a lot of things
71-1_866.55_4.28.wav_ASR	and the the speech professionals were not professional therapists
71-1_871.09_0.612.wav_ASR	they're different
71-1_872.39_3.118.wav_ASR	and she i mean she helped me a lot i would say
71-1_875.61_2.902.wav_ASR	so i should be looking up on this particular thing
71-1_878.63_2.25.wav_ASR	and i should be looking at the picture
71-1_881.53_3.02.wav_ASR	and but she hadn't kept up with it either
71-1_884.71_4.16.wav_ASR	but she had learned about some of the most recent treatments that were available
71-1_889.53_7.52.wav_ASR	so basically what i did is i i went back to exercise as soon as they allowed me
71-1_897.35_2.7.wav_ASR	three i couldn't work out for three months
71-1_900.34_5.67.wav_ASR	because they were concerned that my physical activity had something to do with the stroke
71-1_906.42_0.66.wav_ASR	and she
71-1_909.64_1.189.wav_ASR	oh i just hadta walk
71-1_911.14_1.081.wav_ASR	oh i had
71-1_913.2_1.401.wav_ASR	it tested me for aphasia
71-1_914.74_3.28.wav_ASR	and i hadta wear these for multiple on for about three months
71-1_918.17_2.86.wav_ASR	but i don't have a phone either so
71-1_921.33_2.315.wav_ASR	but i focus on diet
71-1_924.37_4.82.wav_ASR	really wasn't drinking much alcohol then anyway
71-1_930.27_1.38.wav_ASR	oh i've stopped to compute
71-1_932.87_2.66.wav_ASR	so now i'm back exercising as much as i can
71-1_935.83_2.18.wav_ASR	and i'm really careful in terms of my driving
71-1_938.49_7.52.wav_ASR	and i really focus on improvement and terms of my diet and what i
71-1_947.57_2.29.wav_ASR	and i write every day
71-1_950.51_1.38.wav_ASR	and i learn every day
71-1_951.89_3.934.wav_ASR	alright now i'm trying to write a article which i hope to get published
71-1_955.824_20.3.wav_ASR	because that's maybe the hardest thing for my brain that i've ever hadta do before the stroke or after the surgery or after the rehabilitation
71-1_976.405_1.819.wav_ASR	so i'm on top of the tree
71-1_978.345_9.56.wav_ASR	read aloud every day the news papers because i think same words is a way of repeating those
71-1_988.605_2.865.wav_ASR	whether it's the fires that were there
71-1_991.665_2.454.wav_ASR	and i just needta learn how to say a word
71-1_994.405_0.82.wav_ASR	umbrella umbrella
71-1_995.479_4.388.wav_ASR	and i'll probably be able to say that a lot for a long time until the weeks
71-1_999.919_4.279.wav_ASR	and then i'll miss pronounce that one again
71-1_1005.119_5.531.wav_ASR	but that's really all i know how to do is keep it up in terms of
71-1_1011.439_0.611.wav_ASR	and sleeping
71-1_1012.379_2.191.wav_ASR	and i'm always sleeping
71-1_1014.87_2.86.wav_ASR	generally have gone without it
71-1_1018.68_1.81.wav_ASR	you know if you stay up late you're doing something
71-1_1020.89_3.12.wav_ASR	but you still hafta get up because you have a class or you've got stuff to do
71-1_1024.67_8.638.wav_ASR	and i try to make sure i always have at least eight or nine hours of a hour's a day to be able to sleep
71-1_1033.308_3.68.wav_ASR	and that seems to be something that i didn't needta do before
71-1_1037.181_1.688.wav_ASR	now i really do it
71-1_1038.968_2.762.wav_ASR	but that's time i'm doing
71-1_1042.028_0.872.wav_ASR	still working
71-1_1043.248_1.404.wav_ASR	but i'm not able to teach
71-1_1045.089_3.024.wav_ASR	you can see what i would be like in ninety minutes
71-1_1048.268_0.89.wav_ASR	it getting fun of a clock
71-1_1049.328_0.769.wav_ASR	and they're talking
71-1_1050.288_0.602.wav_ASR	people will be gone
71-1_1051.388_0.52.wav_ASR	oh
71-1_1052.271_0.5.wav_ASR	yeah
71-1_1054.451_1.998.wav_ASR	so maybe that'll come
71-1_1056.791_0.58.wav_ASR	but i can do
71-1_1058.051_3.74.wav_ASR	and i could teach through on line and stuff
71-1_1062.471_2.149.wav_ASR	but so far i'm just doing other stuff
71-1_1064.971_1.119.wav_ASR	but i did love teaching
71-1_1067.49_1.36.wav_ASR	well see if i get back to it again
71-1_1069.371_0.419.wav_ASR	oh no
71-1_1070.87_1.35.wav_ASR	and anyway so that's what i do
71-1_1072.81_4.64.wav_ASR	and and and i think doing it consistently is really really important
71-1_1077.79_2.66.wav_ASR	and i just keep pushing myself to do different things
71-1_1081.13_6.08.wav_ASR	there's little nothing that i'm not forcing myself to
71-1_1087.51_0.909.wav_ASR	not forcing myself
71-1_1088.69_2.265.wav_ASR	but certain things i go through every single day
71-1_1091.81_2.36.wav_ASR	yoq every night
71-1_1094.51_1.1.wav_ASR	three i think that's useful
71-1_1096.57_1.69.wav_ASR	but i i don't know
71-1_1098.26_19.94.wav_ASR	again i'm always looking at research always trying to find something that's going to exercise my healing and somewhere else to the extent that my brain will be able to repair those is what was disrupted
71-1_1119.04_7.42.wav_ASR	as spent a few more time trying to figure out why right hand hand person with the stroke on the right side ended up up with aphasia
71-1_1127.38_10.66.wav_ASR	but i mean other than the fact it doesn't qualify me for many clinical trials because they do fire the left hand
71-1_1138.248_3.801.wav_ASR	other than that i guess i just don't worry about it all that much
71-1_1142.228_13.0.wav_ASR	and i'm just doing what i can to try to heal and relate on neuroplasticity to be able to take take hold
71-1_1155.48_9.755.wav_ASR	but i do understand that at my age in my sixties plastic is less likely as much as healing is
71-1_1165.72_1.66.wav_ASR	so i don't know
71-1_1167.66_0.67.wav_ASR	we'll see what
71-1_1168.91_6.48.wav_ASR	just watch it every day this environment in work or this work in progress and see that
71-1_1175.93_2.077.wav_ASR	how it comes out and how it doesn't come out
71-1_1178.67_1.08.wav_ASR	well see yeah
71-1_1179.91_1.98.wav_ASR	little bit of people don't know i have aphasia
71-1_1182.17_12.68.wav_ASR	and i like keeping it that way because the there's a stigma attached to having a disability even if it's an invisible
71-1_1196.42_8.392.wav_ASR	other people just think i'm mistake then them think that they hafta speak very carefully around me
71-1_1205.08_4.784.wav_ASR	oh i i'm better just see if i can just wing it
71-1_1210.7_3.66.wav_ASR	oh yeah very few people know that i have aphasia
71-1_1214.592_1.416.wav_ASR	the family members know
71-1_1216.008_3.437.wav_ASR	but i don't tell anyone else about it
71-1_1219.768_1.825.wav_ASR	it just try to figure it out
71-1_1242.33_1.36.wav_ASR	and it should be something important
71-1_1246.83_4.6.wav_ASR	well you know i i guess i would
71-1_1251.764_12.94.wav_ASR	but something that i would say is being very important for me was working with memory numbness elder who
71-1_1266.024_2.112.wav_ASR	very close to work
71-1_1268.136_3.957.wav_ASR	but i met firstnamea about ten years ago
71-1_1273.036_2.404.wav_ASR	but probably more fifteen years at this point
71-1_1276.336_2.78.wav_ASR	and i was teaching at a university
71-1_1279.476_1.38.wav_ASR	and i invited her to
71-1_1280.996_6.4.wav_ASR	and i was the advisor of the native students because my research is on state university
71-1_1287.93_7.06.wav_ASR	and i had invited her to come and speak in one of my classes
71-1_1295.79_0.926.wav_ASR	and she came down
71-1_1297.17_2.48.wav_ASR	and we hit it off with each other
71-1_1300.24_3.96.wav_ASR	and she was one of the most remarkable people that i've ever
71-1_1304.73_5.19.wav_ASR	and she was the oldest in a family of eleven
71-1_1310.55_3.42.wav_ASR	and she grew up on the magnificent reservation without running water
71-1_1315.01_5.11.wav_ASR	the first person to get a college degree from her
71-1_1321.04_3.68.wav_ASR	and she became the first female triplets
71-1_1325.92_7.08.wav_ASR	and in the last ten years we've gone on trips together
71-1_1333.92_3.12.wav_ASR	and generally because as she's getting older she's under eighty
71-1_1337.32_0.87.wav_ASR	so she lets me do it
71-1_1339.05_7.74.wav_ASR	and you go to different events or different hearings in which she's going to offer tests
71-1_1347.67_7.05.wav_ASR	and what i've learned from hanging out with this woman who's intelligent is the word i would use
71-1_1355.21_1.06.wav_ASR	yeah
71-1_1356.984_2.503.wav_ASR	he doesn't see that well anyway
71-1_1359.704_1.4.wav_ASR	he's trouble reading anymore
71-1_1361.57_3.02.wav_ASR	but she has me write speeches for her
71-1_1365.124_1.586.wav_ASR	and she gets up and presents it
71-1_1366.71_12.02.wav_ASR	and she refuses to to listen to the the response no
71-1_1379.45_3.74.wav_ASR	but she will find a way to pour on through
71-1_1384.07_3.535.wav_ASR	and she gets things done that other people have not done
71-1_1387.89_9.96.wav_ASR	and why i see this is important is my own mother is very passive and very kind of needy and believes that you defer to men
71-1_1398.43_12.315.wav_ASR	and hanging out with firstnamea i have learned a great deal about what it means to be a powerful woman not to worry about if people are pissed off when you say something
71-1_1411.09_1.635.wav_ASR	and just get up
71-1_1412.95_0.663.wav_ASR	see you tomorrow
71-1_1414.29_1.84.wav_ASR	and present your test to me
71-1_1416.263_8.47.wav_ASR	and push every lever that you can easily to be able to get things through
71-1_1424.733_14.14.wav_ASR	so working with firstnamea over the last couple of years we've been able to stop a mind from two places which would have been really difficult
71-1_1440.7_6.776.wav_ASR	so she has been my interaction in terms of what i learned from her
71-1_1447.78_1.68.wav_ASR	yeah it's really funny
71-1_1449.92_2.26.wav_ASR	so that's that's the other thing
71-1_1452.86_0.96.wav_ASR	yeah
71-1_1454.02_6.652.wav_ASR	he's been an on going course of important importance for me i think to model myself after
71-1_1514.123_7.78.wav_ASR	well i mean it looks like it looks like a boy who's playing with a soccer ball
71-1_1522.3_7.984.wav_ASR	and he's just on his own probably in his yard because this is something that he's really interested in doing
71-1_1530.81_8.77.wav_ASR	and he kicked the ball maybe a little bit too properly then he wanted
71-1_1540.7_3.8.wav_ASR	and it broke into the window next door
71-1_1545.58_2.64.wav_ASR	and unfortunately he broke the window
71-1_1549.0_11.31.wav_ASR	and the ball came through the window right next door to the chair where his next door neighbor man is sitting on his chair
71-1_1561.7_4.32.wav_ASR	so he's obviously really upset about this because he could have been hurt
71-1_1566.34_1.16.wav_ASR	and the glass breaks
71-1_1568.22_1.04.wav_ASR	and it's in his yard
71-1_1569.74_1.088.wav_ASR	and it should have happened
71-1_1571.64_7.02.wav_ASR	and so he grabs the chair looks out the window to find the cop who did this to him
71-1_1578.75_3.64.wav_ASR	oh no they're going to be some kind of
71-1_1582.51_3.18.wav_ASR	he's gonna need some kind of repairs that they're made and the pool
71-1_1585.938_20.64.wav_ASR	he looks like he's about ready to head over to the boy's parents to try to figure out how the window would be played for how he would get his apology and the problem that the neighbor boy would never do the same thing again would stay away from the window
71-1_1623.92_0.5.wav_ASR	okay
71-1_1624.855_4.46.wav_ASR	well it looks as if this little
71-1_1630.595_1.88.wav_ASR	let's see
71-1_1632.686_1.727.wav_ASR	hard actually it could be kind of
71-1_1635.675_3.5.wav_ASR	can't decide if it's male or female
71-1_1639.515_3.031.wav_ASR	it's it's a fairy tale
71-1_1643.288_9.44.wav_ASR	they's getting ready to head out to the library somewhere some trip somewhere
71-1_1653.76_5.85.wav_ASR	and their mother looked outside and said
71-1_1660.248_1.642.wav_ASR	oh i think we're gonna see some rain
71-1_1662.48_1.17.wav_ASR	you might need the umbrella
71-1_1664.82_1.11.wav_ASR	but this child says
71-1_1666.34_1.55.wav_ASR	you don't need an umbrella
71-1_1668.44_1.2.wav_ASR	mean this is ridiculous
71-1_1669.94_0.6.wav_ASR	it's not gonna rain
71-1_1670.78_1.68.wav_ASR	and i don't really care about getting wet
71-1_1672.82_0.87.wav_ASR	you know i don't
71-1_1674.76_0.73.wav_ASR	and i'm not sure
71-1_1675.74_1.68.wav_ASR	and i don't melt when the water hits
71-1_1678.28_1.97.wav_ASR	so this this child
71-1_1680.78_0.88.wav_ASR	learning anyway
71-1_1681.66_1.72.wav_ASR	hey this is gonna be fun
71-1_1683.529_1.775.wav_ASR	immediately began to rain
71-1_1686.38_1.31.wav_ASR	all of a sudden said
71-1_1688.02_4.78.wav_ASR	hey i'm getting rainedrops in my eyes
71-1_1693.33_1.4.wav_ASR	and i'm getting really wet
71-1_1695.36_1.22.wav_ASR	but this is not
71-1_1697.22_2.14.wav_ASR	and i didn't understand that it was getting in my eye
71-1_1700.24_4.96.wav_ASR	so i immediately headed back because it was raining much harder than i thought it was
71-1_1706.08_0.654.wav_ASR	walk in
71-1_1706.84_0.896.wav_ASR	three set to my mother
71-1_1708.14_1.485.wav_ASR	and i just looked at her
71-1_1710.54_2.22.wav_ASR	and she of course knew that i was right
71-1_1713.18_11.1.wav_ASR	the mother immediately understood that while it was very difficult for this child to ask for it or to acknowledge that they were wrong
71-1_1725.08_5.08.wav_ASR	they did make clear that they didn't need an umbrella if they were gonna be walking to the lake
71-1_1730.64_3.56.wav_ASR	so the mother then gave them the umbrella
71-1_1734.68_10.14.wav_ASR	and they went back on their way with an umbrella remembering at this point that maybe mother's actually know what they're talking about
71-1_1761.65_0.5.wav_ASR	yeah
71-1_1762.547_29.94.wav_ASR	well what happened is that the cat that belongs to the tree but no longer knew how to get back from the branch that
71-1_1800.778_0.579.wav_ASR	help me
71-1_1802.158_0.382.wav_ASR	me
71-1_1802.54_6.1.wav_ASR	and the little girl is obviously just really enthusiastic about the situation of her cat
71-1_1808.838_1.772.wav_ASR	he's very worried about getting her cat out
71-1_1811.358_5.082.wav_ASR	so she began by going to her father and saying
71-1_1816.78_4.1.wav_ASR	can you please help me get the cat out of the tree
71-1_1820.94_4.437.wav_ASR	and the umbrella
71-1_1825.6_0.417.wav_ASR	poor
71-1_1826.1_18.22.wav_ASR	and he grabbed his ladder and put it against the tree and climbed up but could not get back up to the the the limb where the cat was because those branches are too fragile
71-1_1845.67_8.6.wav_ASR	he also inadvertently kicked off the ladder which then puts him back in the situation that he needs to be rescued
71-1_1855.03_5.868.wav_ASR	so at this point the dog is now barking because the dog wants the father to get out of the tree
71-1_1861.6_10.368.wav_ASR	the barking of the dog is making it more difficult for the cat to be able to inch its way back down to the trunk
71-1_1872.9_8.052.wav_ASR	so the little girl is still really really stressed because her cat is
71-1_1880.952_2.68.wav_ASR	that's a semantic aphasia error
71-1_1883.772_0.899.wav_ASR	make that all the time
71-1_1885.192_3.057.wav_ASR	is really wants her cat to be able to get out
71-1_1888.249_17.88.wav_ASR	so they call the fire department to come down and not just rescue since he now needs also to be rescued since his attempt at putting the ladder against the tree wasn't helpful
71-1_1906.179_13.419.wav_ASR	but it it does absolutely shows that the father was really trying to do whatever his daughter wanted him to do in terms of helping out the get the cat out of the tree
71-1_1939.75_0.39.wav_ASR	yeah
71-1_2104.158_2.744.wav_ASR	oh i'll keep the finite curve out of there
71-1_2107.478_3.16.wav_ASR	but all be next time around
71-1_2113.118_0.492.wav_ASR	yeah
71-1_2113.85_8.89.wav_ASR	the cinderella is she's the daughter of a witch
71-1_2123.66_2.76.wav_ASR	her mother has been killed
71-1_2127.23_2.66.wav_ASR	and so the two of them are
71-1_2131.04_13.9.wav_ASR	and the her father decides that it would be really helpful for his daughter if he remarried if he could provide a mother for his daughter cinderella
71-1_2146.02_1.74.wav_ASR	so he met this
71-1_2149.12_2.03.wav_ASR	don't know that we've ever heard her name
71-1_2151.74_3.0.wav_ASR	but anyway other ways no
71-1_2155.58_6.48.wav_ASR	made very clear that she would be a wonderful mother to cinderella
71-1_2162.44_1.851.wav_ASR	and she also had two daughters of her own
71-1_2165.48_1.34.wav_ASR	oh they
71-1_2167.42_10.34.wav_ASR	and unfortunately the way that cinderella was treated was not appropriate
71-1_2178.36_5.417.wav_ASR	and she was not treated the same way that the stepmother's daughters were treated
71-1_2183.777_4.48.wav_ASR	and and instead she was used as a maid
71-1_2188.336_5.469.wav_ASR	and i have no idea where her father is in this whole picture and why he's not doing anything about this
71-1_2194.037_3.593.wav_ASR	but maybe he's traveling or he's gone or whatever
71-1_2197.83_17.72.wav_ASR	but he's left the management of his daughter to the stepmother who treats her very badly doesn't treat her the same and has given the message to her daughters that it is fine to treat cinderella
71-1_2216.67_10.5.wav_ASR	so she effectively becomes the maid to these two stepsisters and to a stepmother
71-1_2228.39_5.92.wav_ASR	but she's she's very very sweet young woman
71-1_2235.23_16.92.wav_ASR	and she's found the way to also have happiness and assistance relationships with the animals because that's one of her jobs as a maid is to make sure that the animals are fed
71-1_2252.39_1.84.wav_ASR	so she sings
71-1_2255.14_0.93.wav_ASR	they love her
71-1_2256.32_5.39.wav_ASR	and she's close to the the the horses the other animals
71-1_2262.1_9.26.wav_ASR	and she dreams about being in a better situation where she's loved and is treated with more respect than she is
71-1_2271.67_11.59.wav_ASR	well she's so quite beautiful which is certainly one of the reasons why the stepsisters are so mean to her because they are not anywhere near as attractive as she is
71-1_2284.39_18.53.wav_ASR	but while this is going on in this house the king of the kingdom has made it clear to his son that it's time for him to marry because the king would like to retire
71-1_2303.08_7.52.wav_ASR	and he's like to hand down the kingdom to his son
71-1_2311.32_1.88.wav_ASR	but first his son hasta marry
71-1_2313.84_2.509.wav_ASR	and he doesn't really want it
71-1_2316.62_1.587.wav_ASR	he's not interested in any one
71-1_2318.34_1.38.wav_ASR	he's not dancing anyway
71-1_2320.22_3.01.wav_ASR	but the plan is that this is his dude
71-1_2324.16_3.094.wav_ASR	it was kinda like the prince hairy of that time
71-1_2327.3_3.0.wav_ASR	the scare and not the umbrella
71-1_2331.06_5.74.wav_ASR	but in any case the plan is that there's gonna be a a dance
71-1_2336.832_13.545.wav_ASR	and all of the elementary which i guess means of child bearing bearing years are sposta show up at this dance so that he can pick the one that he wants
71-1_2350.732_4.303.wav_ASR	and again we will not get into the finance cute how this all work
71-1_2356.58_2.034.wav_ASR	finally the word gets out
71-1_2359.36_6.948.wav_ASR	the two stepsisters are just really excited about this idea because they're the right age
71-1_2366.94_9.235.wav_ASR	because their mother had married cinderella's father who makes a fair amount of money they can dress really well
71-1_2376.175_11.163.wav_ASR	oh they can really get dressed up to go to this dance and see if they could be the one that would attract the the attention of the prince
71-1_2388.615_1.676.wav_ASR	the cinderella wants to go
71-1_2390.815_3.322.wav_ASR	and she also reads about this that that is coming
71-1_2394.137_3.18.wav_ASR	and that she knows she's elegant because she's the right age
71-1_2397.537_6.18.wav_ASR	and i guess she's of that nationality or whatever criteria they're used
71-1_2404.5_6.33.wav_ASR	but her stepmother kind of makes clear that no she's she's not invited to go
71-1_2411.78_5.16.wav_ASR	he's not gonna be able to go to stores and buy clothes the way he
71-1_2417.82_2.25.wav_ASR	so she tries to make something on her own
71-1_2420.4_3.38.wav_ASR	he tries to take the merchandise and the rag's that are valuable to him
71-1_2424.24_4.62.wav_ASR	he looks up how to make them in a
71-1_2429.36_1.08.wav_ASR	it was on paige's left
71-1_2430.56_1.38.wav_ASR	and i think that's what was coming on
71-1_2432.61_1.33.wav_ASR	and she comes up with the dress
71-1_2434.24_1.5.wav_ASR	and of course she looks amazing
71-1_2436.71_9.244.wav_ASR	yes we're pretty and pink the film with a umbrella umbrella she's got away with it
71-1_2446.2_1.78.wav_ASR	but this is not
71-1_2449.65_1.12.wav_ASR	one this is cinderella
71-1_2450.992_2.458.wav_ASR	so her mother laughs at her and says
71-1_2453.57_1.49.wav_ASR	he's not going out with those clothes
71-1_2455.45_2.61.wav_ASR	and her stepsisters mock her
71-1_2458.95_2.32.wav_ASR	and she's out in the barn by her
71-1_2462.19_9.66.wav_ASR	and all of a sudden this fairy godmother shows up based on one of her wishes
71-1_2472.03_2.42.wav_ASR	oh i wish i could go to the ball
71-1_2475.65_12.128.wav_ASR	and she the reason that the fairy godmother is showing up is because she knows that cinderella is a really sweet young girl
71-1_2488.53_2.041.wav_ASR	and she cares about everybody
71-1_2490.87_1.674.wav_ASR	and she does things for everybody else
71-1_2492.544_4.96.wav_ASR	and because of the personality of her heart she desires this dance
71-1_2498.584_2.36.wav_ASR	so she uses her magical powers
71-1_2502.18_6.324.wav_ASR	and she not only creates a dress for her that is incredibly ornate
71-1_2509.124_2.72.wav_ASR	you can go to the
71-1_2511.9_14.753.wav_ASR	but she also transforms the mice into horses and the pumpkin into carriage to be able to take her so that she can get there
71-1_2526.84_2.1.wav_ASR	and she can arrive in style
71-1_2529.78_4.64.wav_ASR	so cinderella is very very happy hugs her
71-1_2534.78_0.88.wav_ASR	and her grandmother said
71-1_2535.86_5.98.wav_ASR	remember this only will last this dream will only last until midnight
71-1_2542.26_4.463.wav_ASR	at midnight your dress will go back to your rag
71-1_2546.723_5.94.wav_ASR	your horses will be transferred back into the
71-1_2554.163_6.318.wav_ASR	and the coach will be or the carriage will be transformed back into a pumpkin
71-1_2561.13_0.573.wav_ASR	and she says
71-1_2561.943_0.442.wav_ASR	so i know
71-1_2562.423_0.792.wav_ASR	thank you very much
71-1_2563.463_3.157.wav_ASR	so she heads to the the
71-1_2567.38_17.24.wav_ASR	and of course because she's so elegant attractive and shows up with this really regular type of carriage she's treated as royalty her
71-1_2584.975_2.916.wav_ASR	but she the footman opens the door
71-1_2588.095_0.812.wav_ASR	help her
71-1_2589.635_0.812.wav_ASR	and she walks in
71-1_2590.635_2.32.wav_ASR	and immediately the prince just like
71-1_2593.435_0.658.wav_ASR	slipper
71-1_2594.515_2.3.wav_ASR	it's like he's been struck by lightning
71-1_2597.575_1.165.wav_ASR	three she's the one i wanna be
71-1_2598.975_1.165.wav_ASR	he he's over to her
71-1_2600.475_2.06.wav_ASR	there's an incident
71-1_2604.46_2.0.wav_ASR	he dances with her the entire night
71-1_2606.82_5.16.wav_ASR	he's pretty clear that maybe at this point maybe at this point the worst thing in the world if i get to be with this one
71-1_2613.19_4.0.wav_ASR	and and all of a sudden at this point she's pulling away
71-1_2617.56_0.34.wav_ASR	and she said
71-1_2618.12_0.46.wav_ASR	oh i got a
71-1_2618.76_0.34.wav_ASR	he's like
71-1_2619.22_1.32.wav_ASR	you know it's stuck around
71-1_2620.94_0.6.wav_ASR	you got food
71-1_2622.58_0.6.wav_ASR	and they're there
71-1_2624.18_1.12.wav_ASR	and she said
71-1_2625.6_0.71.wav_ASR	oh i gotta get back
71-1_2626.5_0.52.wav_ASR	we gotta go
71-1_2627.3_5.8.wav_ASR	and she runs away at about two or three minutes to midnight because her she
71-1_2633.26_1.166.wav_ASR	oh i've i've got this curve
71-1_2634.56_0.786.wav_ASR	and i got to go away
71-1_2635.38_1.167.wav_ASR	and she races away
71-1_2637.7_2.81.wav_ASR	all of a sudden she's she's a really fast
71-1_2640.94_0.44.wav_ASR	so she's
71-1_2641.38_4.57.wav_ASR	way but all of a sudden he sees that one of her shoes has been left there
71-1_2646.16_0.98.wav_ASR	glass slipper
71-1_2647.86_2.174.wav_ASR	and so he picks that up
71-1_2650.2_3.24.wav_ASR	it's all he's got of her is this glass slipper
71-1_2654.1_2.56.wav_ASR	so he goes back to his father and says
71-1_2657.28_1.28.wav_ASR	oh marry somebody
71-1_2658.86_1.868.wav_ASR	but there's only one woman i wanna marry
71-1_2660.728_1.516.wav_ASR	and she's the one i wanna marry
71-1_2662.968_4.68.wav_ASR	and all i have is this clue that her foot will fit into this shoe
71-1_2668.928_2.54.wav_ASR	it's hard exhausting around the kingdom
71-1_2672.608_7.36.wav_ASR	one one that can who's feet will fit into these slippers the prince will decide if he's a king or a servant
71-1_2680.85_7.16.wav_ASR	so oh the stepsisters who you know they were annoyed at the ball
71-1_2688.27_2.82.wav_ASR	but they pretty sure they get their feet feet into this slipper
71-1_2692.05_1.6.wav_ASR	he one of the king
71-1_2694.54_19.21.wav_ASR	so he's and and of course at this point cinderella's back doing her work taking care of the animals cleaning in the kitchen once again just decorated and adorned and mocked and treated disrecursively by her family
71-1_2714.59_1.81.wav_ASR	so the prince starts riding around
71-1_2716.91_4.25.wav_ASR	it's this really bizarre sort of thing that he's driving around
71-1_2721.43_10.724.wav_ASR	people are running out taking off their shoes and seeing if they're feet will fit into this slipper which is apparently designed to fit this one single woman
71-1_2733.67_1.9.wav_ASR	and he hands up and he stops at their house
71-1_2735.77_6.34.wav_ASR	he's really discouraged at this point because he hasn't yet found the woman who's feet will fit into that slipper
71-1_2743.01_1.095.wav_ASR	he stops at this house
71-1_2744.37_2.793.wav_ASR	the stepsisters do everything they can
71-1_2747.29_3.08.wav_ASR	but their feet are just too big or too long or
71-1_2750.71_0.798.wav_ASR	it's not work
71-1_2751.632_3.22.wav_ASR	and then all of a sudden
71-1_2755.261_2.278.wav_ASR	he's just about ready to leave
71-1_2757.592_1.74.wav_ASR	and all of a sudden he sees a woman
71-1_2760.172_5.59.wav_ASR	and he sees this other woman the maid who's just in the corner
71-1_2766.572_0.428.wav_ASR	and he says
71-1_2767.252_0.588.wav_ASR	don't hurt
71-1_2768.83_1.36.wav_ASR	and the stepmother said
71-1_2770.312_0.798.wav_ASR	oh she's nice
71-1_2771.5_0.97.wav_ASR	two she's our maid
71-1_2773.43_1.84.wav_ASR	and she looks up
71-1_2775.92_5.43.wav_ASR	he the prince just has this strange feeling about her and
71-1_2781.92_1.44.wav_ASR	to have her come out
71-1_2783.78_7.311.wav_ASR	and i'd like to see if if the slippers will fit her feet
71-1_2791.091_2.035.wav_ASR	and so she comes out
71-1_2793.371_0.92.wav_ASR	and she's mad
71-1_2794.711_3.639.wav_ASR	you know she's been working in the kitchen and in the ball
71-1_2798.931_6.2.wav_ASR	and she's you know not not looking anyway the prince person that had been at the
71-1_2805.87_0.8.wav_ASR	but she came out
71-1_2806.831_0.759.wav_ASR	and she's set down
71-1_2808.51_3.56.wav_ASR	the prince put the slipper on her foot
71-1_2812.99_1.08.wav_ASR	and it fit
71-1_2814.73_0.98.wav_ASR	and then he looked at her
71-1_2815.71_22.48.wav_ASR	and what was remarkable is that he was able to see that it was exactly the same person even if she was clearly not of the same stature than she that he had assumed and
71-1_2839.43_15.337.wav_ASR	so they lived happily after until just like prince firstnameh some of the cinderella because she was not of high enough stature
71-1_2854.767_18.19.wav_ASR	and then he hadta renounce his crown and go to another continent and yeah and then start writing proving metalfilms metalfils metalfilms about his situation to make money
71-1_2872.957_0.84.wav_ASR	alright
71-1_2874.864_1.272.wav_ASR	oh yeah yeah
71-1_2900.37_0.5.wav_ASR	okay
71-1_2905.61_1.0.wav_ASR	oh
71-1_2910.67_11.58.wav_ASR	an interesting really interesting thing about clocks to me recently is that i went to a physical check
71-1_2923.03_2.831.wav_ASR	and i'd just turn sixty five
71-1_2926.39_2.52.wav_ASR	so i had never experience this before
71-1_2929.05_5.28.wav_ASR	my uncle my uncle physical
71-1_2935.52_1.03.wav_ASR	and i walked in the room
71-1_2936.75_0.57.wav_ASR	and i sat down
71-1_2937.65_2.34.wav_ASR	the nurse is checking my blood pressure
71-1_2940.41_4.62.wav_ASR	you're checking you know the my heart rate my pulse and all the other stuff
71-1_2945.73_3.06.wav_ASR	and then she handed me a piece of paper and a pen and said
71-1_2948.98_1.34.wav_ASR	like you to draw a clock
71-1_2951.06_1.01.wav_ASR	and i said
71-1_2953.58_0.57.wav_ASR	and she said
71-1_2954.34_3.38.wav_ASR	because i i want to see what kind of picture you you can draw
71-1_2958.32_2.76.wav_ASR	so it seems ridiculous
71-1_2961.62_1.027.wav_ASR	but i did it anyway
71-1_2963.0_0.93.wav_ASR	oh i just
71-1_2964.52_9.32.wav_ASR	and i knew how to handle a picture apparently with a clock which is first you put down the twelve
71-1_2974.0_0.89.wav_ASR	and then you put down the sandwich
71-1_2975.14_0.66.wav_ASR	and you put the
71-1_2975.98_0.71.wav_ASR	and they put the knife
71-1_2976.74_8.82.wav_ASR	and then you fill the number so that everything is located where it should be instead of you know having them too crowded
71-1_2986.12_3.09.wav_ASR	and then i hadta draw the pictures of two forty five
71-1_2990.32_1.08.wav_ASR	and i finished
71-1_2991.6_0.4.wav_ASR	and i said
71-1_2992.42_1.46.wav_ASR	oh is this what you want
71-1_2994.75_4.17.wav_ASR	or did you wanna just look at what you have on the wall that's right there which is a
71-1_2999.82_0.95.wav_ASR	and she said
71-1_3001.11_2.02.wav_ASR	you have passed this test
71-1_3003.49_0.32.wav_ASR	and she says
71-1_3004.28_1.87.wav_ASR	it was essentially a depression test
71-1_3006.254_13.939.wav_ASR	but when you're sixty five and you go in for a appointment sorry when you go to see an appointment for an annual check you will hafta draw a clock
71-1_3020.834_0.477.wav_ASR	and i said
71-1_3021.514_2.193.wav_ASR	one point will they stop doing this
71-1_3023.76_9.43.wav_ASR	because well i did indeed grow up with the round sock right you know the round sock right
71-1_3033.8_1.68.wav_ASR	everything i do is digital
71-1_3035.807_16.95.wav_ASR	so what happens at what generation will they decide that you do not have dementia or memory or whatever and that you simply have a digital understanding of of what time is
71-1_3053.5_2.36.wav_ASR	oh anyway if i do it i'm not gonna do it
71-1_3056.16_6.11.wav_ASR	maybe i'll just mess with them and just put down some digital stuff and see what they do
71-1_3062.88_3.78.wav_ASR	my p t or something like that
71-1_3066.9_2.818.wav_ASR	but anyway it's it's a test that they do
71-1_3069.718_3.888.wav_ASR	and i found it really irritating though i passed
71-1_3074.018_3.915.wav_ASR	but it's it's gonna be excellent very very quickly
71-1_3078.438_1.048.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
71-1_3084.638_1.963.wav_ASR	oh let me see
71-1_3091.487_18.88.wav_ASR	one of the things i useta do when my daughter was younger is every usually the first week and a half to watch the easy watch
71-1_3110.83_14.71.wav_ASR	and what the easy watch was is north of the washington river river there's one place that in january the eagles are on the way somewhere else
71-1_3125.67_0.72.wav_ASR	they're coming back
71-1_3126.63_1.247.wav_ASR	they're going south or something
71-1_3127.877_5.666.wav_ASR	but they all show up in this lake for about three or four days
71-1_3134.157_8.44.wav_ASR	and so what people do is they have groups the audubon society and other groups that show up with
71-1_3144.23_4.65.wav_ASR	and we watch the the birds the eagles because you can see them
71-1_3149.19_1.113.wav_ASR	they're really really close
71-1_3150.45_1.46.wav_ASR	you can see the
71-1_3152.49_1.454.wav_ASR	and you can see them with their mother
71-1_3154.33_2.28.wav_ASR	and there's just so many of them at one time
71-1_3157.17_2.038.wav_ASR	in washington we have a lot of hot
71-1_3159.43_4.8.wav_ASR	but we don't necessarily see ball the eagles as much
71-1_3164.36_1.23.wav_ASR	it's much more rare
71-1_3166.48_4.788.wav_ASR	that's something that we did for a number of years
71-1_3171.36_2.94.wav_ASR	even when she was thirteen and wasn't really talking to him anymore
71-1_3174.98_2.763.wav_ASR	we always had fun on that day
71-1_3177.96_0.725.wav_ASR	they were shouting
71-1_3179.02_3.122.wav_ASR	first she dresses really really warm because it's gonna be twenty below
71-1_3182.59_3.58.wav_ASR	we would go to the bank with bank
71-1_3186.63_2.08.wav_ASR	we would wait for the eggs to show
71-1_3188.91_1.44.wav_ASR	we would watch them for a while
71-1_3190.65_2.38.wav_ASR	and we would go have hotcoke
71-1_3193.31_2.86.wav_ASR	and she will talk you know during that time
71-1_3196.61_2.19.wav_ASR	when we were home then it was
71-1_3199.11_0.88.wav_ASR	oh she's my
71-1_3200.21_0.568.wav_ASR	thank you
71-1_3200.778_1.896.wav_ASR	one and two and three and four
71-1_3202.738_13.726.wav_ASR	but there was always that one period even in those very very difficult early twenties that my always always talked to me after we watched the eagles
71-1_3216.464_5.16.wav_ASR	so that's one of the things that i would think of when i think of the word bird
71-1_3227.38_1.01.wav_ASR	what what was the word again
71-1_3230.244_2.56.wav_ASR	oh i don't know if you wanna hear that story
71-1_3233.039_0.485.wav_ASR	oh
71-1_3233.991_2.78.wav_ASR	well okay
71-1_3236.777_13.094.wav_ASR	and i can tell you a a recent one that will clearly not be rained or anything because really when you start getting there that one it could be way more interesting
71-1_3250.021_10.775.wav_ASR	and i will talk about something i did last summer since since my stroke i've been trying to push myself a little bit
71-1_3260.881_2.569.wav_ASR	again i'm i'm much more tired than i useta be
71-1_3263.61_5.251.wav_ASR	but i'm still trying to push my boundaries to find exactly what's possible
71-1_3268.93_1.28.wav_ASR	oh and how much can i do
71-1_3270.29_1.827.wav_ASR	and how long can i drive
71-1_3272.13_3.6.wav_ASR	and how many hours a day can i you know be active
71-1_3275.741_2.789.wav_ASR	and so i work with this non-profit
71-1_3279.53_5.7.wav_ASR	and we were having an event in northern washington
71-1_3285.397_2.48.wav_ASR	and it's our our group is called wacko
71-1_3289.337_1.68.wav_ASR	we do with mma i do you
71-1_3291.677_3.779.wav_ASR	so i i head up for this wealth's event
71-1_3295.737_1.06.wav_ASR	and i hadta get up
71-1_3296.957_5.26.wav_ASR	think i left town at five to get up there by eight
71-1_3302.331_5.519.wav_ASR	we had events all day long and talking and you know different things going on
71-1_3307.891_1.32.wav_ASR	it was really really hot
71-1_3310.051_3.538.wav_ASR	and i was ready to drive home by five o'clock
71-1_3314.151_2.269.wav_ASR	about an hour on the
71-1_3317.011_2.559.wav_ASR	it's about three and a half hours at three and a half hours
71-1_3319.71_2.98.wav_ASR	but i decided i can't drive anymore
71-1_3323.47_1.68.wav_ASR	my head was just
71-1_3326.15_3.68.wav_ASR	and i needed to sleep really really quickly
71-1_3329.87_2.42.wav_ASR	to learn to listen to myself
71-1_3332.61_4.86.wav_ASR	my body says you pull over and you run
71-1_3337.649_5.112.wav_ASR	it's you don't just walk around through drink some coffee and you keep on going
71-1_3343.27_1.34.wav_ASR	so i pulled into this hotel
71-1_3345.85_1.66.wav_ASR	it it luckily i found him
71-1_3347.849_3.041.wav_ASR	you know i didn't have a reservation reservation or anything
71-1_3351.11_9.614.wav_ASR	and i was just looking for a place that had an opening so i could go in and get out of the son and you know cover my eyes and not hafta drive anymore
71-1_3360.85_10.96.wav_ASR	but because i was as tired as i was and because i was pushed to my boundaries my aphasia had clearly flared
71-1_3372.95_2.18.wav_ASR	so i walked in this
71-1_3375.69_3.36.wav_ASR	and there were lots of i mean clearly they were a lot of vacation
71-1_3379.64_2.57.wav_ASR	well actually i didn't know that right away
71-1_3382.66_1.98.wav_ASR	but i thought it said vacon
71-1_3385.14_0.809.wav_ASR	but i wasn't sure
71-1_3386.18_0.937.wav_ASR	and i walk in the door
71-1_3388.0_2.42.wav_ASR	and there's this woman behind the the
71-1_3390.82_0.48.wav_ASR	and i said
71-1_3391.54_2.24.wav_ASR	you know i'm here for a room
71-1_3394.62_0.32.wav_ASR	and i said
71-1_3395.02_1.08.wav_ASR	do you have any vacation
71-1_3397.62_5.68.wav_ASR	and and of course that's what happens with aphasia is you say word
71-1_3403.92_3.86.wav_ASR	yeah vacations could have been a response to covid
71-1_3408.16_3.161.wav_ASR	people are wearing masks
71-1_3411.64_1.783.wav_ASR	and they're being very careful about that
71-1_3413.72_2.58.wav_ASR	so of course i was trying to say
71-1_3416.34_1.56.wav_ASR	you have a
71-1_3418.62_1.778.wav_ASR	umbrella umbrella
71-1_3420.7_1.02.wav_ASR	you have a vacation
71-1_3422.16_3.26.wav_ASR	and they went into her closet
71-1_3426.26_1.62.wav_ASR	yeah everybody here's been vacation
71-1_3428.38_0.711.wav_ASR	you all wear it
71-1_3429.38_0.988.wav_ASR	write everything down
71-1_3430.72_0.54.wav_ASR	and i'm just saying
71-1_3431.88_0.98.wav_ASR	so you have a room
71-1_3433.14_0.664.wav_ASR	and she said
71-1_3433.92_1.033.wav_ASR	yes yes yes yes
71-1_3435.16_0.545.wav_ASR	don't worry
71-1_3435.705_1.0.wav_ASR	we followed coach
71-1_3436.845_0.623.wav_ASR	and don't worry about it
71-1_3437.565_1.797.wav_ASR	oh you're not gonna get it here
71-1_3439.805_1.863.wav_ASR	the she gave me my umbrella
71-1_3441.825_6.66.wav_ASR	and i realize that was one way to cover things up is you know
71-1_3448.76_1.911.wav_ASR	if she had a vacation
71-1_3451.44_0.31.wav_ASR	and i said
71-1_3452.165_0.98.wav_ASR	you have a
71-1_3453.98_1.77.wav_ASR	and so we just went with backpacks
71-1_3456.24_2.03.wav_ASR	and then finally i went my way back to
71-1_3459.14_2.56.wav_ASR	you have an empty room that i can sleep in
71-1_3462.68_5.02.wav_ASR	so i got the room went in and drank a lot of cold water and little bit sleep for twelve hours
71-1_3468.94_0.48.wav_ASR	yeah
71-1_3471.54_2.08.wav_ASR	so that's that's another
71-1_3478.5_0.5.wav_ASR	yeah
71-1_3480.14_0.8.wav_ASR	okay
71-1_3481.62_20.94.wav_ASR	oh i guess if i were going to choose something to talk about reston i would talk about how i paid my way through my undergraduate career which is through
71-1_3504.63_14.68.wav_ASR	and i waited beginning at at kind of a little coffee shop that was near where i lived because i had no car
71-1_3520.12_1.31.wav_ASR	and i could just bike there
71-1_3522.42_1.45.wav_ASR	and they were very very kind
71-1_3524.03_2.94.wav_ASR	and i did the practice
71-1_3528.1_14.32.wav_ASR	but i learned very quickly after about six months that you would get paid ten to fifteen percent as a tip based on the the prices of the restaurant
71-1_3543.14_8.24.wav_ASR	so what made sense was to find the restaurant that was the most expensive in terms of prices and were there
71-1_3552.167_3.873.wav_ASR	doing the exact same same part of service
71-1_3556.39_19.218.wav_ASR	well if they're only playing five dollars for their meal and they're handing you fifty cents that's not gonna be nearly as good as if they spent twenty dollars for their meal and paid you two or four dollars for it
71-1_3575.98_5.36.wav_ASR	so what i learn to do is keep going to more and more extensive research
71-1_3582.46_20.82.wav_ASR	the the the maybe unold story is the the the greedy spoons are just as good if not better than the really happily you know highly
71-1_3604.84_2.74.wav_ASR	so that's what i ended up doing
71-1_3608.2_4.664.wav_ASR	and but again it what was so interesting to me as that i worked just as hard
71-1_3613.32_4.157.wav_ASR	and i use the same sort of you know
71-1_3618.84_5.61.wav_ASR	you hafta sort of keep a reviewing list of task that you're in the middle of doing
71-1_3624.45_1.994.wav_ASR	well you're going to the bar to get drinks
71-1_3626.65_1.508.wav_ASR	you're going here to get your foot
71-1_3628.39_1.405.wav_ASR	you're gonna go people more water
71-1_3630.11_0.946.wav_ASR	you're gonna give me your check
71-1_3631.51_5.578.wav_ASR	you hafta keep them all kind of reviewing all at one time
71-1_3637.31_4.757.wav_ASR	trying to decide exactly how you're going to prioritize each of those tasks
71-1_3642.067_10.0.wav_ASR	it's it's really i mean being a waitress is a really mentally challenging
71-1_3653.687_3.66.wav_ASR	it's just bizarre that they don't pay people any money to do that
71-1_3657.49_4.33.wav_ASR	but i was lucky because i made enough money that i was still able to graduate
71-1_3662.01_8.22.wav_ASR	and i wasn't paying the degree of the amount of money that grand students and undergrads are paying now which is
71-1_3672.05_0.61.wav_ASR	oh
71-1_3673.93_2.38.wav_ASR	so yeah it was for my undergraduate
71-1_3676.61_1.701.wav_ASR	grade was school that was very difficult
71-1_3678.311_5.3.wav_ASR	but yeah i had no student loans because i worked as a waitress in restaurant
71-1_3698.06_0.59.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
71-1_3699.03_2.999.wav_ASR	and it's it's really mentally kind of like
71-1_3703.14_1.235.wav_ASR	you know three minutes
71-1_3704.68_0.709.wav_ASR	can go get that
71-1_3705.62_0.591.wav_ASR	oh my goodness
71-1_3706.54_0.366.wav_ASR	oh
71-1_3707.62_2.536.wav_ASR	it's it's it's kind of a challenge
71-1_3710.2_0.816.wav_ASR	it's kind of fun
71-1_3713.34_0.455.wav_ASR	yeah
71-1_3718.76_0.845.wav_ASR	you can kinda see it
71-1_3719.76_0.59.wav_ASR	and they eat it
71-1_3720.7_1.28.wav_ASR	you need more coffee over there
71-1_3722.26_0.96.wav_ASR	and you got this going on
71-1_3723.52_4.32.wav_ASR	and i will say that the second place i worked i carried it
71-1_3728.62_8.414.wav_ASR	and when i went to get a physical they were trying to figure out why this muscle on this arm was stronger than this one
71-1_3738.16_0.74.wav_ASR	there's something going on
71-1_3739.09_0.75.wav_ASR	they're in a tree
71-1_3739.97_0.49.wav_ASR	then i said
71-1_3740.68_1.82.wav_ASR	and i'm just really really strong
71-1_3743.1_1.92.wav_ASR	yeah
71-1_3753.971_14.825.wav_ASR	well if i were going to make peanut butter and jelly sandwich i would begin by rolling out the bread
71-1_3769.311_2.802.wav_ASR	and taking out two slices of bread
71-1_3772.113_2.019.wav_ASR	and and laying them on the table
71-1_3774.633_8.24.wav_ASR	then i would go and get the jar of jelly and the jar of peanut butter
71-1_3783.713_4.173.wav_ASR	and i would bring probably a spoon and a knife with me
71-1_3788.57_2.863.wav_ASR	and i would begin with the peanut butter peanut butter
71-1_3792.068_2.272.wav_ASR	it's really difficult work to say it
71-1_3794.488_0.84.wav_ASR	peanut butter
71-1_3796.268_4.045.wav_ASR	and i would spread that on the one side of the bread
71-1_3800.828_3.96.wav_ASR	the other piece of bread i would put on
71-1_3805.108_1.06.wav_ASR	we'd use a spoon
71-1_3806.568_1.011.wav_ASR	and i would pull out the jug
71-1_3807.92_4.373.wav_ASR	and i would spread that evenly on that piece of bread
71-1_3812.7_2.72.wav_ASR	then i would close the two of them together
71-1_3816.12_6.32.wav_ASR	and i would close screw the tops back on the jelly and the peanut butter
71-1_3822.66_0.63.wav_ASR	put them away
71-1_3823.88_1.4.wav_ASR	and then i would eat my sandwich
71-1_3832.11_5.6.wav_ASR	well i don't do it often
71-1_3838.45_1.708.wav_ASR	oh my goodness
71-1_3840.85_15.069.wav_ASR	when i do my laundry decide the fact that i do have washing machine downstairs because i can do all of it at one time
71-1_3856.37_2.654.wav_ASR	and i only wanna do it once a week or every other week
71-1_3859.024_4.476.wav_ASR	because it's just something i find kinda boring to do
71-1_3863.904_3.04.wav_ASR	what i do is
71-1_3868.044_1.74.wav_ASR	thank you i hafta do this today
71-1_3870.184_1.23.wav_ASR	so let me think about this
71-1_3871.644_3.54.wav_ASR	all of my dirty clothes
71-1_3875.33_5.584.wav_ASR	and i usually use the smell test to find out whether they go into the hamper or not
71-1_3880.914_18.7.wav_ASR	and when i decide that everything needs to be washed which also will include the towels the washcloths and the other towels hand clothes and the other washing up in the kitchen i would all of them in
71-1_3900.01_5.52.wav_ASR	use a container of laundry
71-1_3907.24_0.66.wav_ASR	and i would put that
71-1_3908.31_4.39.wav_ASR	we'd carry it to the back side of my the back seat of my car
71-1_3913.6_8.52.wav_ASR	and i would make sure i had corners or had cash that i could use for the corner market in the laundry
71-1_3923.11_1.57.wav_ASR	we would go into the laundry
71-1_3924.88_6.327.wav_ASR	the largest machine that was available that i could do all of my laundry at one time in one machine
71-1_3931.207_5.18.wav_ASR	and i would put the laundry in
71-1_3937.23_12.357.wav_ASR	if they didn't all fit i would make sure that the clothing that could be washed at a higher temperature would go into a separate small washing machine
71-1_3950.36_1.814.wav_ASR	make sure the slope was in
71-1_3952.46_2.068.wav_ASR	make sure i had enough water
71-1_3955.36_6.792.wav_ASR	and then i would probably go by food or something there being washed
71-1_3962.36_0.924.wav_ASR	come back
71-1_3963.54_1.44.wav_ASR	they're in the tree
71-1_3965.86_2.403.wav_ASR	and i don't really follow them the way i'm sposta
71-1_3968.54_0.71.wav_ASR	just a little bit
71-1_3969.66_4.29.wav_ASR	and then put them away kind of as i use them when i
71-1_3985.92_4.75.wav_ASR	you mean what would i choose to wear or
71-1_3995.3_0.57.wav_ASR	oh i see
71-1_3996.39_11.38.wav_ASR	well the first thing i would do every morning is start my coffee because that really is going to hafta happen before i make decisions about what matches what
71-1_4008.33_2.38.wav_ASR	oh i went back to my
71-1_4011.9_2.75.wav_ASR	usually do the four over
71-1_4015.51_1.41.wav_ASR	and i really the car
71-1_4017.61_2.19.wav_ASR	so i usually would grind the coffee
71-1_4020.33_1.78.wav_ASR	the the water
71-1_4023.83_2.36.wav_ASR	and i would go into my bed
71-1_4026.63_3.12.wav_ASR	generally i have some idea of what i'm gonna do
71-1_4030.63_3.28.wav_ASR	if only because i hafta dig stuff out sometimes
71-1_4033.91_1.26.wav_ASR	and i don't wanna have any
71-1_4035.602_4.45.wav_ASR	but i don't really have time to look a lot in the morning
71-1_4040.49_2.54.wav_ASR	so i'm gonna be in a nice area of what i'm gonna wear
71-1_4043.51_5.14.wav_ASR	so i usually start well clearly under the
71-1_4049.59_3.481.wav_ASR	then whatever pants or short i wear
71-1_4053.071_3.66.wav_ASR	at that point it the water's usually ready
71-1_4057.231_2.079.wav_ASR	so yeah i got my lines clear
71-1_4059.631_10.319.wav_ASR	you know running around here half dressed and then trying to make decisions about how cold it is
71-1_4070.191_1.359.wav_ASR	so i needta wear it
71-1_4071.75_1.32.wav_ASR	do i needta wear a umbrella
71-1_4073.07_2.819.wav_ASR	well the cookie's being made
71-1_4076.37_2.828.wav_ASR	but the time the cops are made i've got on my basic clothes on
71-1_4079.87_6.666.wav_ASR	and then i take the coffee with me in the bathroom when i make decisions about errors and hair and all that other stuff
71-1_4086.94_4.822.wav_ASR	but yeah the basic is all the assistance the night before so i hafta worry about it
71-1_4091.79_5.715.wav_ASR	and if i absolutely i'm tired and don't know what i'm doing i just wear a blanket because it matches everything
71-1_4098.11_1.432.wav_ASR	so i have a lot of black clothes
71-1_4100.07_0.77.wav_ASR	oh there's that
71-2_14.77_15.16.wav_ASR	my favorite part about where i live and i live on the near east side of massachusetts about a mile away from the capital is that's close to the lake
71-2_30.89_1.34.wav_ASR	oh mathematics is a city
71-2_32.41_2.38.wav_ASR	we we have four different legs that are here
71-2_35.21_8.54.wav_ASR	and and the magic actually comes from a word from ohanas that actually specifically means four leagues
71-2_44.69_5.4.wav_ASR	so a block away from where i live is a lake
71-2_50.725_3.302.wav_ASR	and it's the biggest of the lake
71-2_54.665_6.7.wav_ASR	and what i like the most about it is there's a bike path to my
71-2_62.83_6.42.wav_ASR	the leg is to my left leg with a running path that goes along it
71-2_70.27_7.38.wav_ASR	and i literally can get pretty much everywhere than i needta go in the city of madison without having to drive
71-2_79.43_1.82.wav_ASR	and i'm very close to the lake
71-2_82.17_4.02.wav_ASR	so one of the things i do when i run
71-2_86.95_2.98.wav_ASR	so now i would pretty much call it fast walking
71-2_90.071_3.86.wav_ASR	oh i'm not not not from my
71-2_94.531_6.34.wav_ASR	in my prime i was i would run about seven or eight miles a morning
71-2_100.931_2.26.wav_ASR	and i would get it down to about seven minutes
71-2_103.351_3.4.wav_ASR	oh and pretty much just walking and
71-2_107.621_3.7.wav_ASR	and we're more like eleven minutes miles
71-2_111.741_2.56.wav_ASR	but i usually get about five in every morning
71-2_114.621_7.309.wav_ASR	it's it's it's kind of mediocre in the sense that you can look at the water
71-2_122.181_1.029.wav_ASR	you can see the bird
71-2_123.87_10.3.wav_ASR	it's just much more sophisticated than it would be to be in a tree
71-2_134.77_3.32.wav_ASR	so it's one of the things i really like about where i live
71-2_139.91_1.36.wav_ASR	the bread
71-2_142.244_0.5.wav_ASR	oh
71-2_144.217_0.467.wav_ASR	okay
71-2_144.93_1.073.wav_ASR	oh i don't think that i'm
71-2_146.764_2.154.wav_ASR	that's the right word that i make
71-2_149.284_0.5.wav_ASR	five i mean
71-2_153.748_0.593.wav_ASR	oh what is it
71-2_155.384_1.306.wav_ASR	yeah i just see the word
71-2_156.884_0.526.wav_ASR	but i kept saying
71-2_157.764_1.566.wav_ASR	oh i'm screwing that word
71-2_159.584_0.92.wav_ASR	but no i wasn't
71-2_160.706_2.562.wav_ASR	once upon a time i hear a word that i already know
71-2_163.426_0.544.wav_ASR	thank you
71-2_164.206_1.044.wav_ASR	that i'm saying that wrong
71-2_165.746_4.624.wav_ASR	but i i just hafta be realistic with words that i actually already know
71-2_171.106_0.564.wav_ASR	oh yeah
71-2_173.086_3.54.wav_ASR	long the leg is much better than being on a treadmill
71-2_177.146_2.769.wav_ASR	and i the block away which is why i'm living here
71-2_179.915_0.5.wav_ASR	yeah
71-2_200.31_2.58.wav_ASR	again my speech is not right
71-2_204.23_8.987.wav_ASR	but the most part when i speak i know what i'm going to say
71-2_213.77_16.481.wav_ASR	but if i try to say something that's more complicated something that is explaining something in more detail or becomes more explicit my words don't come out the way that i like to say them
71-2_230.251_8.589.wav_ASR	or the words are in my brain but i'm not quite able to articulate them the way i wanna
71-2_238.97_3.38.wav_ASR	generally i know right away when i've made a mistake
71-2_243.091_1.339.wav_ASR	but sometimes i don't
71-2_244.631_2.0.wav_ASR	yes today i i said to someone
71-2_246.696_3.48.wav_ASR	and well we've got this collection coming up and january four
71-2_250.676_1.27.wav_ASR	and she said
71-2_253.536_0.404.wav_ASR	oh boy
71-2_253.94_0.621.wav_ASR	it's apple
71-2_254.576_0.84.wav_ASR	and i said
71-2_255.492_0.747.wav_ASR	what did i say
71-2_256.376_0.528.wav_ASR	and she says
71-2_256.996_0.815.wav_ASR	you said january
71-2_258.98_1.021.wav_ASR	well it feels like january
71-2_260.696_3.525.wav_ASR	again i tried to just wing those and figure out a way to get past it
71-2_264.41_8.22.wav_ASR	but i simply cannot trust that what will come out of my mouth is what i'm actually trying to say
71-2_273.01_14.82.wav_ASR	and i don't know how to fix that except just to keep trying to reinstate those language paths that have been disrupted and try to catch them fast
71-2_295.73_2.62.wav_ASR	yes i remember exactly when i had a stroke
71-2_298.52_5.42.wav_ASR	had a stroke on january first twenty twenty one
71-2_320.33_14.302.wav_ASR	so i essentially had a thunderclap headache to my right temporal limb and did not know what it was for two days
71-2_335.13_1.573.wav_ASR	and then of course they admitted me
71-2_336.703_9.4.wav_ASR	but it was passed the window of operation to be able to give me some type of drugs that might have broken up the clot
71-2_347.563_2.227.wav_ASR	so i entered the hospital
71-2_350.403_1.92.wav_ASR	they assumed i would have another stroke
71-2_353.183_0.607.wav_ASR	have not
71-2_354.09_4.36.wav_ASR	and they have not been able to find the cat of the initial
71-2_359.72_1.67.wav_ASR	as soon as it was the perfect storm
71-2_362.04_12.44.wav_ASR	as soon as it might have been a combination of working out really hard being stressed because of the pandemic and not being able to have christmas
71-2_374.76_2.765.wav_ASR	those were pretty magnificent days
71-2_378.52_3.0.wav_ASR	we were in a position then where it was pretty easy
71-2_381.743_3.632.wav_ASR	and and i don't know what else it could have been
71-2_385.583_5.67.wav_ASR	literally there's there's physically nothing wrong with my body
71-2_391.703_3.994.wav_ASR	and all of my numbers increase that i should not have a stroke
71-2_395.843_2.223.wav_ASR	and yes yeah i had a stroke
71-2_398.363_1.62.wav_ASR	so yeah anyway
71-2_400.181_2.92.wav_ASR	peanut butter and jelly
71-2_403.981_4.263.wav_ASR	which at some point i you know just move on with that i guess
71-2_408.721_0.379.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
71-2_418.32_17.68.wav_ASR	well as i said a week ago most of the recovery has been done through the direction of therapy or help from any medical professional
71-2_437.57_8.66.wav_ASR	and i think that that's kind of a tragedy in the sense that people that have had
71-2_446.73_3.68.wav_ASR	but i was careerized as having a skilled
71-2_451.57_12.92.wav_ASR	we are in the position of the particular to come to completely recover if we're given the right right kind of treatment within certain timeframes
71-2_464.99_16.04.wav_ASR	so i think the first six months after stroke is really crucial in terms of rapid recovery because you're building on the spontaneous spontaneous recovery that that you're your brain is able to regenerate to bring back language
71-2_482.13_11.14.wav_ASR	really disappointed in the american health insurance insurance that i was not given what i should have gone
71-2_493.53_18.08.wav_ASR	so what i've done on my own is really impressed my the quality of my diet
71-2_511.89_1.417.wav_ASR	five i've already experienced that
71-2_513.307_1.654.wav_ASR	have been doing that for about ten years
71-2_515.327_10.103.wav_ASR	and i gave up drinking completely though i don't really think that was an issue since i was drinking maybe one glass a month
71-2_525.43_10.02.wav_ASR	but it might improve no improvement
71-2_536.21_4.1.wav_ASR	it might increase inflammation in my body
71-2_540.325_10.3.wav_ASR	and that's something that i'm trying to work very strongly to make sure that i have an adequate income
71-2_551.465_1.7.wav_ASR	have exercised
71-2_553.585_1.6.wav_ASR	again i'm already
71-2_559.81_19.778.wav_ASR	so i've exercised the very conscious cognitive test that i do every single day to make sure that i'm make sure that my focus and concentration are really high
71-2_579.588_2.895.wav_ASR	again i was in a coma
71-2_582.748_15.385.wav_ASR	so i have all the writing every day doing a lot of close work every day trying to develop and weve architecture together every single day
71-2_598.133_2.617.wav_ASR	and i've done it much more consistently than in the past
71-2_601.85_7.16.wav_ASR	writing is always reliable in the sense that i have the operation of everything
71-2_609.473_2.297.wav_ASR	and i do sometimes use the wrong word
71-2_612.753_2.617.wav_ASR	but i you're generally catch it when i at it
71-2_615.79_3.34.wav_ASR	and i always hadta add it before the stroke too
71-2_619.37_9.39.wav_ASR	so i don't know to what extent those mistakes are connected to the stroke affect or whether that's just the way that i write
71-2_628.91_4.36.wav_ASR	you do a rough draft to get the ideas out
71-2_633.443_2.915.wav_ASR	and then you refine it the second time around
71-2_637.303_9.727.wav_ASR	so i i think the only real difference from the way i lived my life after the stroke then before is making sure that i always get enough sleep
71-2_647.963_4.187.wav_ASR	before the stroke i tried to get sleep
71-2_652.45_7.12.wav_ASR	but if i didn't i just powdered on because i have a schedule that i have to
71-2_660.87_8.901.wav_ASR	now it's it's a priority for me to the extent that i have available to me to make sure that i sleep as much as i can
71-2_670.05_5.06.wav_ASR	but other than that i just have a reservation every single day that i'm always done
71-2_676.49_0.563.wav_ASR	really well
71-2_677.41_1.165.wav_ASR	exercising every day
71-2_679.05_2.72.wav_ASR	push my brain as much as i can
71-2_682.23_7.28.wav_ASR	and i made attempt to take back up a language skill
71-2_689.79_3.4.wav_ASR	and i was taking spanish classes before the stroke
71-2_693.397_2.653.wav_ASR	and i took branch when i was in high school
71-2_696.33_3.6.wav_ASR	and i picked up a little bit of dance when i lived in kootenay
71-2_701.01_4.263.wav_ASR	but i thought spanish would be much more useful than french
71-2_706.37_2.1.wav_ASR	so i started taking a spanish class
71-2_708.69_4.73.wav_ASR	and i hadta disconnect because it was late at night
71-2_713.57_1.99.wav_ASR	it just really wasn't working out for me
71-2_716.7_10.19.wav_ASR	but from what i read recently i think one of the things that might be really helpful to rescue my english is to pick up spanish
71-2_727.56_1.88.wav_ASR	it's i you know i don't
71-2_729.6_1.14.wav_ASR	thought it might be confusing
71-2_731.12_2.971.wav_ASR	but one not try it you know
71-2_734.091_1.949.wav_ASR	one two years and what happened
71-2_736.54_3.066.wav_ASR	oh yeah that may be what i do next i think
71-2_739.76_1.333.wav_ASR	what i'm already doing
71-2_767.08_3.158.wav_ASR	let me see
71-2_771.54_4.68.wav_ASR	happy sad
71-2_779.25_0.7.wav_ASR	oh
71-2_782.83_5.9.wav_ASR	and i'm gonna talk about my reaction to what happened on nine eleven in two thousand and one
71-2_790.19_2.46.wav_ASR	and i was tired
71-2_793.11_3.98.wav_ASR	it was the beginning of the the spring semester in two thousand and one
71-2_797.09_4.16.wav_ASR	and and my daughter had gone to school
71-2_803.03_9.82.wav_ASR	so as soon as she left it at about eight fifteen i got on the computer because i hadta finish my salad
71-2_813.15_3.66.wav_ASR	yes i i should have already finished my sandwich
71-2_817.67_1.9.wav_ASR	and it was generally done
71-2_819.73_2.089.wav_ASR	but i was kinda playing with some of the end of it
71-2_822.23_5.923.wav_ASR	my athletic polynesian class because i just wanted to just overload it a little bit
71-2_828.41_1.08.wav_ASR	so i wasn't on the line
71-2_830.33_2.92.wav_ASR	obviously the radio was not because i hadta concentrate
71-2_833.352_4.423.wav_ASR	or and i certainly wasn't much in terms of television when i was trying to do my work
71-2_837.872_12.614.wav_ASR	so i was in this zone of science with no connection to the outside world whatsoever just going through these different different areas and discovering what i was trying to do
71-2_851.51_5.54.wav_ASR	and at two o'clock in the afternoon i was gonna take a break
71-2_857.21_3.32.wav_ASR	and i was gonna go to my gym and work out
71-2_861.07_1.14.wav_ASR	and it was a beautiful day
71-2_862.61_1.64.wav_ASR	was you know september oh
71-2_868.85_0.8.wav_ASR	and i turned on the radio
71-2_870.87_3.98.wav_ASR	and the announcement said
71-2_875.69_2.16.wav_ASR	don't really know what the school's gonna close
71-2_878.53_0.64.wav_ASR	and i kept saying
71-2_879.77_1.12.wav_ASR	the school's gonna close
71-2_881.09_0.48.wav_ASR	thank you
71-2_888.143_3.145.wav_ASR	and and i got to the the gym
71-2_892.33_2.473.wav_ASR	and there were totalizations every
71-2_895.423_2.206.wav_ASR	they were in the desk when you come in
71-2_897.723_1.36.wav_ASR	and that never ever
71-2_899.443_1.827.wav_ASR	everybody looked really really upset
71-2_901.963_1.96.wav_ASR	so i i'm walking in their saying
71-2_904.483_2.874.wav_ASR	things happen here that i don't know about
71-2_907.37_1.5.wav_ASR	but everybody else knows about it
71-2_909.35_2.12.wav_ASR	they're all staring at the scene
71-2_911.55_3.34.wav_ASR	so i went to the section where my bread
71-2_915.83_3.818.wav_ASR	and again the treadmills were running along the lake
71-2_919.77_3.262.wav_ASR	but that's what i was gonna do that day because i hadta do some lifting
71-2_923.27_1.915.wav_ASR	and that's what i saw
71-2_925.185_12.8.wav_ASR	but at that point by two o'clock in the afternoon they were just replaying it over and over again about the two plays that were hitting the the twin towers in dc
71-2_938.265_2.813.wav_ASR	and they were investigating people who were trying to get away
71-2_941.365_1.64.wav_ASR	everything's covered with ashes
71-2_944.49_6.22.wav_ASR	and i remember getting on the the treadmill and you know putting on my headphones and listening to it
71-2_951.07_7.56.wav_ASR	and i just kept going fast and fast and faster because the adventure of what had happened was just so shocking
71-2_959.41_3.86.wav_ASR	so i kinda use that you know to increase my work
71-2_963.53_2.82.wav_ASR	and i got out of there
71-2_966.61_1.02.wav_ASR	and i went home and said
71-2_967.91_0.384.wav_ASR	wait a minute
71-2_968.294_4.966.wav_ASR	we've got a really close friend that lives in dc that works near the pentagon
71-2_973.35_2.086.wav_ASR	so it's he
71-2_975.69_0.829.wav_ASR	what's going on
71-2_977.21_0.94.wav_ASR	so i tried to call
71-2_978.45_3.78.wav_ASR	of course i couldn't get through because all the the the singers were were
71-2_982.23_3.06.wav_ASR	one no one could get home and deceased
71-2_985.57_1.836.wav_ASR	everything was shot down
71-2_988.71_2.16.wav_ASR	and i got on the bus
71-2_991.09_0.94.wav_ASR	and they start email
71-2_992.31_1.48.wav_ASR	then i emailed my department
71-2_993.97_1.78.wav_ASR	and i was in the political science department
71-2_995.93_0.34.wav_ASR	and i said
71-2_996.81_2.067.wav_ASR	we're gonna have a palace on campus
71-2_999.41_1.76.wav_ASR	we're gonna invite the community
71-2_1001.32_2.481.wav_ASR	and we're going to explain what is going on
71-2_1004.36_5.934.wav_ASR	and we're gonna explain all of that
71-2_1010.3_3.871.wav_ASR	we're gonna explain the the reactions of it
71-2_1014.18_3.5.wav_ASR	we're gonna talk about the history of
71-2_1018.48_2.588.wav_ASR	we're gonna explain exactly what's going on here
71-2_1021.068_3.442.wav_ASR	and everybody got back to me and maybe
71-2_1024.788_2.32.wav_ASR	mean they everyone responded and said
71-2_1027.288_1.502.wav_ASR	and i'd be happy to talk about this
71-2_1029.048_5.302.wav_ASR	and i'd be happy to talk about the sentences in a row that are going on currently
71-2_1034.35_7.22.wav_ASR	and maybe that's related to what's going on with the the the the the
71-2_1041.762_18.784.wav_ASR	all we knew at that point that they were coming from the military and that they were attacking the entire state and the penitency and the world trade center as symbols of impairment and the western college i guess
71-2_1060.546_2.0.wav_ASR	and and how it is that we're gonna
71-2_1063.386_1.58.wav_ASR	they were enemies with us
71-2_1066.026_2.694.wav_ASR	oh yeah it all came together really
71-2_1069.006_1.514.wav_ASR	we went to bed at one o'clock in the morning
71-2_1071.126_4.007.wav_ASR	finally got email back from my friend in dc who was fine
71-2_1075.986_3.141.wav_ASR	and got up went to campus the next day
71-2_1079.127_3.12.wav_ASR	and all the the the legs were just squashed
71-2_1082.467_8.34.wav_ASR	and all we did is talk about what happened in every single class hour after hour
71-2_1091.927_2.073.wav_ASR	alright that's that's a lot there
71-2_1094.327_0.6.wav_ASR	yeah
71-2_1095.507_3.195.wav_ASR	it was a great palace by the way
71-2_1098.702_2.177.wav_ASR	we had and i think we had five hundred people
71-2_1101.002_4.48.wav_ASR	it's standing long standing standing
71-2_1106.562_0.607.wav_ASR	my turn to say
71-2_1107.262_1.0.wav_ASR	he's standing
71-2_1108.642_3.021.wav_ASR	people hadta stand in the back
71-2_1111.942_1.56.wav_ASR	but what i'm trying to say is stand
71-2_1115.89_2.82.wav_ASR	well these phrases that i useta be able to say
71-2_1118.87_0.92.wav_ASR	my start to say them
71-2_1119.99_1.393.wav_ASR	and i forget what they're in the middle
71-2_1122.11_1.8.wav_ASR	stomping room
71-2_1124.33_0.389.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
71-2_1124.719_2.671.wav_ASR	filled up the place basically you know
71-2_1127.69_1.1.wav_ASR	and everybody's question
71-2_1129.59_0.76.wav_ASR	how do they
71-2_1130.57_2.4.wav_ASR	and that's what we began with
71-2_1133.59_0.94.wav_ASR	oh
71-2_1136.424_12.445.wav_ASR	other than i missed the whole thing because of course i was on line writing a letter that i never gave because you know science took over yeah where we were
71-2_1189.34_19.84.wav_ASR	well it seems to be taking place in a neighborhood which is relatively close to each other
71-2_1209.06_5.336.wav_ASR	and it looks like what's going on is a boy is in the backyard
71-2_1214.88_2.2.wav_ASR	and he's playing with his soccer
71-2_1217.52_1.92.wav_ASR	he's practicing his carriage
71-2_1220.38_11.126.wav_ASR	and unfortunately this time the ball doesn't the ball doesn't go where he hoped it would go and crashes into the window
71-2_1232.06_5.1.wav_ASR	and it looks like it might have been the window of his next door neighbor
71-2_1237.38_1.26.wav_ASR	it could have been his father's
71-2_1238.86_0.86.wav_ASR	it's difficult to know
71-2_1239.78_7.2.wav_ASR	but it was a window that was next to the yard in which he was playing with his soccer ball
71-2_1247.88_3.96.wav_ASR	well it hit the the glass of the window and broke it
71-2_1252.48_4.08.wav_ASR	and unfortunately there was a man that was sitting in the chair right next to the woman
71-2_1257.78_7.66.wav_ASR	and the soccer ball not only broke the window but went through completely into the the house
71-2_1266.32_2.88.wav_ASR	so apparently they have no screens from what i'm guessing
71-2_1269.48_2.687.wav_ASR	so it can't be as sunny because we have migraines here
71-2_1272.167_11.407.wav_ASR	and anyway the ball ended up up in the house in the room directly where the man was sitting
71-2_1284.62_3.27.wav_ASR	and he was not pleased about this
71-2_1288.15_5.76.wav_ASR	he stood up and looked out the window to try to figure out who had broken the window
71-2_1294.2_1.43.wav_ASR	where did the ball come from
71-2_1295.93_9.0.wav_ASR	and who is the person who had redirected that ball toward his window
71-2_1305.71_7.06.wav_ASR	he's it's clearly that there's going to be some kind of ramifications as a result of this
71-2_1313.51_3.88.wav_ASR	because if it's his son his son is going to be school
71-2_1317.638_12.22.wav_ASR	and and if it's his neighbor he's gonna expect an application and probably some sort of payment to prepare the the glass that's been broken
71-2_1331.61_2.368.wav_ASR	so umbrella in the summer
71-2_1351.36_23.18.wav_ASR	well we're gonna tell you we're gonna type this story mother knows best which is a play on the fact that their appearance was much older than their age
71-2_1374.637_1.24.wav_ASR	and it was very painful
71-2_1376.717_2.203.wav_ASR	you know the father leaves
71-2_1379.217_1.12.wav_ASR	mother is the house
71-2_1380.877_2.16.wav_ASR	father knows best
71-2_1383.339_19.92.wav_ASR	oh in any case this particular story is gonna be mother knows better than their children
71-2_1403.327_4.073.wav_ASR	but in this particular case that's exactly what's happening
71-2_1407.4_17.237.wav_ASR	and and what's going on is this child and the child's mother is battling over whether this boy needs to take an umbrella with him when he leaves
71-2_1424.637_5.175.wav_ASR	and the mother is saying because she they're getting ready for the boy to go off on his own
71-2_1430.477_1.44.wav_ASR	and the mother is saying
71-2_1432.357_10.134.wav_ASR	it's on what we see with the clothes that are outside the the sky and what we see on the weather reports it looks like it's gonna rain
71-2_1442.577_1.295.wav_ASR	so i think you should take an umbrella
71-2_1443.872_2.02.wav_ASR	well and the little boy is going
71-2_1446.272_1.58.wav_ASR	am not taking an umbrella
71-2_1448.132_1.546.wav_ASR	but i don't need one
71-2_1450.032_1.204.wav_ASR	don't care of it rain
71-2_1451.572_0.969.wav_ASR	oh not gonna meet
71-2_1453.572_2.904.wav_ASR	my i'm fine on my own
71-2_1457.132_0.708.wav_ASR	so she said
71-2_1458.152_1.904.wav_ASR	well alright you know best
71-2_1460.812_1.116.wav_ASR	and she says goodbye to him
71-2_1462.212_0.403.wav_ASR	thank you
71-2_1462.615_2.1.wav_ASR	if she's still holding the umbrella
71-2_1465.335_0.768.wav_ASR	he's out
71-2_1466.655_2.06.wav_ASR	and it's not just a sprinkle
71-2_1468.935_3.82.wav_ASR	but it really really starts to rain really hard
71-2_1472.915_1.22.wav_ASR	so it's a downpour
71-2_1475.7_2.625.wav_ASR	and he's not happy
71-2_1478.655_2.945.wav_ASR	so the rain is getting inside
71-2_1481.94_2.26.wav_ASR	and he's getting really really wet
71-2_1484.32_4.93.wav_ASR	his clothes are getting drenched and scattered with the water
71-2_1489.82_1.78.wav_ASR	so he gets about half a ball
71-2_1492.22_1.78.wav_ASR	and he can't even say what's going on
71-2_1494.3_3.58.wav_ASR	so he heads back to his mother very
71-2_1499.24_0.76.wav_ASR	you look at them
71-2_1501.22_2.46.wav_ASR	and she has the grace not to say
71-2_1503.88_0.744.wav_ASR	you told me so
71-2_1505.06_1.279.wav_ASR	because mother's no best
71-2_1506.48_1.32.wav_ASR	they knew of that word
71-2_1508.74_1.78.wav_ASR	and he stays her and looks at her
71-2_1510.86_1.98.wav_ASR	and she hands him the umbrella
71-2_1513.76_0.96.wav_ASR	he he's off
71-2_1515.14_3.02.wav_ASR	three this time remembering in his brain
71-2_1519.26_3.04.wav_ASR	my mother's not always wrong about everything
71-2_1524.14_4.02.wav_ASR	but of course he forgets it by the next week when something else comes up
71-2_1528.48_7.687.wav_ASR	where we are in this week he is now assured that his mother actually has wife
71-2_1536.5_2.081.wav_ASR	my mother inlaw
71-2_1555.22_3.121.wav_ASR	well speaking of drama in the neighborhood
71-2_1559.54_8.9.wav_ASR	what had happened here because the cat was sitting on the branch
71-2_1569.36_3.67.wav_ASR	and the cat has the right to sit on the the branch
71-2_1573.78_3.17.wav_ASR	but the next door neighbor hasta dog
71-2_1576.95_6.958.wav_ASR	and the dog came out and immediately saw the cat and ran over and started barking at the cat
71-2_1584.11_1.22.wav_ASR	and the cat was sposta
71-2_1586.07_5.36.wav_ASR	so the cat ran from the the dog and ran up the tree because that was close
71-2_1591.15_6.0.wav_ASR	close and that was away to get away from the dog because the dog couldn't climb
71-2_1597.65_2.042.wav_ASR	so the cat climbed up the tree
71-2_1600.41_0.894.wav_ASR	they're seeing young cat
71-2_1601.49_6.55.wav_ASR	it's a cat that's just barely a kitten and isn't really a consequence to be being that high up
71-2_1608.43_1.61.wav_ASR	so the cat clawed up
71-2_1610.78_6.66.wav_ASR	the little girl ran out saw her cat was up in the tree and called her father and said
71-2_1619.16_1.18.wav_ASR	cat is up in the tree
71-2_1621.04_3.96.wav_ASR	and she's out on the bar
71-2_1625.76_9.82.wav_ASR	and it doesn't look like she's finding her way to get back out because she's mowing very loudly and clearly wants to be rescued
71-2_1636.4_1.22.wav_ASR	so please help me
71-2_1638.16_2.86.wav_ASR	please help me get my cat out of the tree
71-2_1641.3_3.6.wav_ASR	the father's trying to be shivering and the kid
71-2_1645.16_4.36.wav_ASR	so he immediately goes into the grass and finds his ladder
71-2_1650.2_21.487.wav_ASR	and the plan for him was he would simply be able to climb up the the ladder get to the tree inch his way up to the limb where the cat was grab it probably probably put it inside inside his chest
71-2_1671.68_2.39.wav_ASR	and then he could be you know the hero
71-2_1674.76_5.62.wav_ASR	he could fulfill his daughters' requests
71-2_1681.42_2.26.wav_ASR	unfortunately he got up in the tree
71-2_1684.54_10.49.wav_ASR	and the he hadn't carefully rested the ladder against the tree in the way he really needed
71-2_1695.33_1.1.wav_ASR	and it's all
71-2_1697.33_4.1.wav_ASR	so now we have two people that hafta be rescued from the tree
71-2_1701.65_7.1.wav_ASR	we have the cat that is still meowing loudly out in the far
71-2_1709.29_12.14.wav_ASR	and of course the father can't reach it because he's his weight is too heavy to be able to move into those limbs without breaking them down
71-2_1721.65_1.78.wav_ASR	and then he would fall down and get her
71-2_1724.19_6.76.wav_ASR	so at this point the mother who knows best has called the fire department and said
71-2_1731.81_2.587.wav_ASR	you've got a sister fighting going on here
71-2_1734.59_1.211.wav_ASR	well that isn't what she said
71-2_1735.801_6.58.wav_ASR	but that's what she thought in her brain because she doesn't say words in her children because she doesn't want them to know about her family
71-2_1742.881_2.24.wav_ASR	can you please bring
71-2_1745.553_16.023.wav_ASR	unfortunately we now need help from firefighters to not only get the cat out of the tree but my husband climb up to climb up to help rescue the cat
71-2_1761.576_6.523.wav_ASR	and my daughter is still happy because she's worried about the cat
71-2_1768.376_1.494.wav_ASR	and now she's ready about her dance
71-2_1770.876_2.274.wav_ASR	and the dog is still barking
71-2_1773.756_3.1.wav_ASR	oh this she's about ready
71-2_1777.576_1.228.wav_ASR	there's the fire firefighters are here
71-2_1779.076_1.061.wav_ASR	and they're coming over
71-2_1780.05_2.35.wav_ASR	and they're going to help the man get down first
71-2_1782.71_3.09.wav_ASR	and they're going to reach out and get the cat
71-2_1786.3_8.752.wav_ASR	and what the mother's gonna go and grab the dog and put him in the other room so that everybody will relax a bit
71-2_1796.11_3.213.wav_ASR	everybody can make it out of the tree without getting hurt
71-2_1799.323_1.586.wav_ASR	the end
71-2_2004.09_16.38.wav_ASR	and what we're essentially looking for here is economic mobility and social mobility and what the criteria is that women hafta prove their situation in order to improve their situation
71-2_2021.77_1.86.wav_ASR	so we're gonna start with that
71-2_2023.99_13.24.wav_ASR	and this is an example of the very restrictive rules that were available to women in certain circumstances
71-2_2038.46_5.74.wav_ASR	oh no what we're seeing here are family a family which is relatively middle class
71-2_2045.26_10.16.wav_ASR	and the in both cases what we had were two family's with children
71-2_2056.56_3.02.wav_ASR	and each of them had a spouse that died
71-2_2061.01_13.758.wav_ASR	the husband had one daughter who was living with him
71-2_2075.16_1.256.wav_ASR	but his wife had died
71-2_2076.416_3.656.wav_ASR	so he had a a young daughter who was about six years old
71-2_2080.296_11.24.wav_ASR	again in a university of well go back to well we'll say nineteen century men could not raise their own children
71-2_2091.936_1.731.wav_ASR	they hadta have a woman
71-2_2093.856_0.741.wav_ASR	it was her room
71-2_2094.68_3.78.wav_ASR	well people were relatively rigid in terms of what they were allowed to
71-2_2099.12_3.78.wav_ASR	so he hadta find a wife in order to care for her daughter
71-2_2103.96_13.22.wav_ASR	in another part of town relatively same social status we have a man and and wife who had two children
71-2_2118.02_0.76.wav_ASR	and he
71-2_2119.64_8.66.wav_ASR	so the only way that she would be able to survive as a female is to find a husband or find a man that would marry her
71-2_2129.4_2.86.wav_ASR	so they're both out looking for another
71-2_2133.36_1.3.wav_ASR	and they meet each other
71-2_2135.0_28.16.wav_ASR	and of course what the husband is looking for is someone that will do all the other things that women are sposta do and that men don't do because we have very restricted very very different dependent dependent situation
71-2_2164.74_1.14.wav_ASR	so they meet each other
71-2_2166.5_3.74.wav_ASR	and he's gotten the expression that she's gonna be a wonderful wife
71-2_2170.64_3.8.wav_ASR	and she certainly gushes all over his daughter
71-2_2175.66_1.62.wav_ASR	and so they they married
71-2_2177.28_12.12.wav_ASR	they're now three children two daughters from her original family his daughter named cinderella from his family
71-2_2189.86_2.76.wav_ASR	and they've now blended into this new society
71-2_2193.69_11.26.wav_ASR	the father then follows his rule which is go out and make money for the family and leaves the house under the management of the stepmother
71-2_2205.31_21.673.wav_ASR	the stepmother on the other hand has not fulfilled her promises to mother the stepmother but instead she's going to favor her daughters and is going to treat the other stepdaughter as if she's a maid
71-2_2227.87_6.94.wav_ASR	and for whatever reason the father does not interfere and what he sees when he is home
71-2_2235.41_10.02.wav_ASR	and so what we have is this really terrible situation that exists for cinderella
71-2_2245.527_4.893.wav_ASR	and cinderella again had a beautiful mother who loved her
71-2_2250.667_1.201.wav_ASR	he was close to her father
71-2_2252.027_0.76.wav_ASR	he lost his mom
71-2_2253.147_9.1.wav_ASR	now she's also in the situation where she's clearly treated differently than her stepdaughters stepsisters
71-2_2262.887_2.555.wav_ASR	smack happy ever after
71-2_2265.442_1.074.wav_ASR	it happens all the time
71-2_2267.022_0.954.wav_ASR	everybody moving on
71-2_2269.122_1.278.wav_ASR	again they live in safety
71-2_2270.462_8.32.wav_ASR	there's no way that woman can improve their their position in this city except through marriage
71-2_2279.762_2.46.wav_ASR	is the only possible option to them
71-2_2282.222_18.073.wav_ASR	and so they're probably roll growing up is to learn how to manage a house and also be attractive to the head or her head or her head or whatever part of them
71-2_2300.295_2.36.wav_ASR	and i don't know what happens if they're not
71-2_2303.295_2.211.wav_ASR	oh i guess they just fake it
71-2_2305.815_2.972.wav_ASR	in any case that's not part of this particular story
71-2_2309.455_1.22.wav_ASR	and she's scared
71-2_2310.915_3.032.wav_ASR	and so that's one complication she doesn't have to deal with
71-2_2313.947_8.6.wav_ASR	in any case on the other side of the city at a higher place is
71-2_2323.465_20.82.wav_ASR	and again while the prince has essentially a lot of anxiety power and he's at the top of his course and social and statues he's all so optimistic to marry
71-2_2344.363_9.7.wav_ASR	because the plan is that he will marry a wife and that wife will then bear him children
71-2_2354.443_6.44.wav_ASR	and those children then means that they will be a legion that will continue on to the next generation
71-2_2361.383_1.861.wav_ASR	so he may not wanna get married
71-2_2363.24_6.92.wav_ASR	and we don't really know what his generator device is or where it's located
71-2_2370.56_2.72.wav_ASR	but he's he understands what his job is
71-2_2373.42_1.38.wav_ASR	he hasta find a woman
71-2_2375.14_1.42.wav_ASR	he hasta find a part
71-2_2377.46_11.7.wav_ASR	and his plan is to find someone who's really attractive while he feels the the operations of his office in the restricted area
71-2_2389.76_4.76.wav_ASR	so the plan is he's gonna get this over with quickly
71-2_2394.609_4.6.wav_ASR	yes they're gonna have this huge dance this huge ball
71-2_2400.449_1.88.wav_ASR	and everyone in the kingdom
71-2_2403.749_2.623.wav_ASR	my i'm assuming we're pretty much middle class and above
71-2_2406.669_3.7.wav_ASR	he's not really going to the present tract class
71-2_2410.569_1.731.wav_ASR	it's not part of this at all
71-2_2413.36_14.64.wav_ASR	is involved all of the elementary females who were not married to come and audition for him so that he can walk through and make his
71-2_2429.0_1.96.wav_ASR	again this is clearly
71-2_2432.56_5.54.wav_ASR	it's almost like that bathroom show which i've never seen and never would see
71-2_2438.84_2.588.wav_ASR	but i certainly know a word or two
71-2_2441.428_16.26.wav_ASR	that that woman is gonna be tested and graded and chosen out of a a line of other available women to be able to be the one that he is deciding he's going to meet with
71-2_2458.96_11.18.wav_ASR	so anyway all three of these stepsisters and cinderella all know that they are evil
71-2_2470.64_6.62.wav_ASR	and they all start thinking about how wonderful their the situation would be if they get
71-2_2477.759_2.965.wav_ASR	and and again what's interesting is we're not talking about love
71-2_2480.919_2.54.wav_ASR	we're not talking about you know
71-2_2485.819_3.132.wav_ASR	we're not talking about people that are compatible with each other
71-2_2489.099_5.541.wav_ASR	we're talking about they will somehow be attractive enough for this male to choose them
71-2_2495.14_6.668.wav_ASR	and then they're life situation will improve because those are the only options they have
71-2_2502.2_11.34.wav_ASR	and it's a very restrictive society and a certain time in in college which is very very limiting for female patients
71-2_2514.72_1.813.wav_ASR	so they're they're all getting ready
71-2_2516.76_1.25.wav_ASR	and they know what they hafta do
71-2_2518.04_0.98.wav_ASR	they have to look at the tree
71-2_2519.46_1.52.wav_ASR	so they hafta have a really nice dress
71-2_2521.32_1.34.wav_ASR	their hair's to be fixed up
71-2_2522.8_14.67.wav_ASR	but they have to somehow make them stand out from the others and order to be chosen in this decorative contest that they're going to be entered into
71-2_2538.05_7.3.wav_ASR	so because the stepmother favors her own daughters she pulls out whatever money they have a value
71-2_2545.61_13.82.wav_ASR	and she gets them the the fancy dresses that you could possibly choose and you know with hair dresses and they're makeup and everything else to get them as gussy up as possible
71-2_2560.48_2.99.wav_ASR	slipper cinderella pretty much knows that she's on her shoe
71-2_2563.97_8.22.wav_ASR	so she pulls out a book that she got from her mother which has patterns of dresses
71-2_2572.57_8.51.wav_ASR	because she's very smart and very creative and because she's hadta do a lot of the meaningful work in the house she knows how to sew
71-2_2581.9_5.18.wav_ASR	so she pulls together some scraps of material that are available to her
71-2_2587.26_3.6.wav_ASR	and she puts together this pretty cool dress really
71-2_2591.12_1.64.wav_ASR	and it's kinda off the shoulder
71-2_2593.16_3.109.wav_ASR	yeah it's kinda pink which kinda plays off her hair
71-2_2597.18_1.602.wav_ASR	and she's ready to go
71-2_2599.24_1.68.wav_ASR	and she's doing the best that she
71-2_2600.92_1.16.wav_ASR	and that's what she has
71-2_2602.7_0.86.wav_ASR	and she's ready
71-2_2603.98_2.02.wav_ASR	and of course her mother says
71-2_2606.3_1.06.wav_ASR	or no science
71-2_2609.46_2.94.wav_ASR	you are not of our staff
71-2_2612.88_1.4.wav_ASR	you are a person
71-2_2615.14_2.22.wav_ASR	you don't have the right clothes for it
71-2_2617.64_1.2.wav_ASR	you're dressed correctly
71-2_2619.54_0.74.wav_ASR	you are not gonna
71-2_2620.5_1.42.wav_ASR	my daughters are going
71-2_2622.98_4.02.wav_ASR	and they the stepsisters of course have gotten their cue from their mother
71-2_2627.22_1.94.wav_ASR	they know to be really really cool to her
71-2_2629.38_1.02.wav_ASR	so they laugh at her
71-2_2631.4_4.92.wav_ASR	and she goes out in the rain to take care of the animals because that's kind of her routine
71-2_2636.32_4.32.wav_ASR	as that's the place where she can go and get some kind of effect from the other end
71-2_2641.04_0.764.wav_ASR	and she's out there
71-2_2642.1_1.3.wav_ASR	you know she's
71-2_2644.4_2.137.wav_ASR	and she's wearing her dress and her
71-2_2647.06_1.593.wav_ASR	you know she doesn't know what she's gonna do
71-2_2648.78_0.6.wav_ASR	what is she
71-2_2649.62_7.806.wav_ASR	what can she possibly do to some how get out of the mysterious situation that she's in
71-2_2657.46_8.42.wav_ASR	and and this fairy godmother appears to her because she's you know a wonderful person
71-2_2666.1_1.27.wav_ASR	he's giving to other people
71-2_2667.6_1.24.wav_ASR	and she discovers
71-2_2669.7_4.22.wav_ASR	so this fairy godmother shows up and says
71-2_2674.82_0.58.wav_ASR	are you cool
71-2_2675.52_0.52.wav_ASR	what's wrong
71-2_2676.1_0.7.wav_ASR	oh what do you mean
71-2_2677.62_0.66.wav_ASR	and she said
71-2_2678.52_2.04.wav_ASR	and i would like to go to the the ball
71-2_2680.9_1.26.wav_ASR	but i want to wear

71-2_2689.8_7.06.wav_ASR	have the same opportunities that my stepsisters have
71-2_2697.8_0.58.wav_ASR	so she
71-2_2699.7_0.6.wav_ASR	oh
71-2_2700.72_5.86.wav_ASR	and she you know uses her magic abilities and
71-2_2707.42_0.56.wav_ASR	and she looks
71-2_2708.52_7.98.wav_ASR	and she transforms the rats into horses that will be pulling a carriage
71-2_2716.86_3.12.wav_ASR	and the carriage is transformed from a pumpkin
71-2_2721.2_4.98.wav_ASR	and she uses her wand and and goes over cinderella's
71-2_2726.24_11.79.wav_ASR	and all of a sudden she's wearing these ornate delicate happily expensive beautiful dress
71-2_2738.29_8.18.wav_ASR	her hair is is made up and the the the

71-2_2778.35_9.98.wav_ASR	and the fancy ball dress that you're wearing will be transformed back into
71-2_2789.37_2.005.wav_ASR	so please go

71-2_2808.012_1.558.wav_ASR	please enjoy your moment
71-2_2810.63_3.14.wav_ASR	so she hugs the fairy godmother
71-2_2814.41_1.88.wav_ASR	and she gets in the coach
71-2_2817.21_2.2.wav_ASR	he's taking to the
71-2_2820.33_0.36.wav_ASR	you guess
71-2_2821.17_8.52.wav_ASR	even her stepsisters don't know who this woman is because she's dressed so magnificent that she stands out
71-2_2830.55_10.16.wav_ASR	all the other people that are watching all they can think of is she must be from a really really rich
71-2_2842.35_1.34.wav_ASR	and we don't know of her
71-2_2843.97_3.16.wav_ASR	but she must be from a very high social status
71-2_2847.65_1.71.wav_ASR	and she's clearly very beautiful
71-2_2849.56_5.5.wav_ASR	mean the fact that they don't even recognize their own stepsister is pretty telling
71-2_2855.87_1.702.wav_ASR	in any case she walks in
71-2_2858.34_8.7.wav_ASR	the prince immediately in his office sees her and says
71-2_2867.361_0.856.wav_ASR	he's the stand up
71-2_2868.82_1.51.wav_ASR	and she's the one
71-2_2870.72_1.77.wav_ASR	and he hears over to work
71-2_2872.76_1.61.wav_ASR	and he immediately looks at her
71-2_2874.58_5.47.wav_ASR	he sees that she's all so beautiful on top of being really wealthy and wealthy
71-2_2880.91_1.45.wav_ASR	he's all so great
71-2_2882.78_0.91.wav_ASR	he's a wonderful dancer
71-2_2884.34_0.31.wav_ASR	there's a
71-2_2885.36_1.74.wav_ASR	there's an ottoman
71-2_2887.88_2.89.wav_ASR	and there's there's campus between
71-2_2891.62_0.875.wav_ASR	and he said
71-2_2893.18_1.008.wav_ASR	he's thinking it's mine
71-2_2894.42_1.321.wav_ASR	oh i thought this was gonna be awful
71-2_2896.04_2.52.wav_ASR	and i thought this was gonna be a dirty a dirty
71-2_2898.78_2.795.wav_ASR	but i really like her
71-2_2902.0_1.34.wav_ASR	oh this is
71-2_2903.86_2.26.wav_ASR	he was hoping for something this match
71-2_2906.281_1.956.wav_ASR	but i was prepared for something else
71-2_2908.461_1.931.wav_ASR	just this just can work
71-2_2910.761_2.955.wav_ASR	so he wants to spend time with her as much as he can
71-2_2913.941_0.479.wav_ASR	oopsin
71-2_2914.681_0.98.wav_ASR	and she's into it too
71-2_2915.801_1.52.wav_ASR	mean they're they're really connected
71-2_2917.761_1.52.wav_ASR	it's just this wonderful bike
71-2_2920.001_4.289.wav_ASR	and then she looks up at the clock and sees that it's five minutes to midnight
71-2_2926.49_28.8.wav_ASR	and she knows because of this beautiful princess but is just a lovely minor class female in his kingdom who's wearing
71-2_2956.938_4.418.wav_ASR	he she knows that that audience will also be gone
71-2_2961.538_9.22.wav_ASR	he she's pretty sure that what he really wanted is the the the trapping the animals all the stuff that goes along with wealth
71-2_2971.438_5.015.wav_ASR	so she knows as soon as he sees her who she really is it's gonna be over
71-2_2976.453_4.78.wav_ASR	so she races away as quickly as she can because she wants to get away as quickly as she can
71-2_2981.093_8.34.wav_ASR	he doesn't wanna see the look in his eye when he sees who she really is and what her real status is and how she's really distressed
71-2_2990.23_2.14.wav_ASR	so he's he doesn't understand what happened
71-2_2992.653_0.437.wav_ASR	here's she go
71-2_2993.173_0.717.wav_ASR	what did he say
71-2_2994.053_1.277.wav_ASR	did he say something to me
71-2_2995.46_1.51.wav_ASR	and there were she having
71-2_2997.36_6.02.wav_ASR	and she races away as quickly as she can so quickly that she trips on her shoe
71-2_3003.6_0.62.wav_ASR	and she
71-2_3004.74_1.712.wav_ASR	her her shoe falls off
71-2_3006.6_1.342.wav_ASR	he doesn't have time to grab it
71-2_3008.32_0.93.wav_ASR	but she's gotta get home
71-2_3009.56_0.89.wav_ASR	and she's gotta get away
71-2_3010.96_1.49.wav_ASR	so she makes it around the corner
71-2_3012.45_3.64.wav_ASR	and immediately it happens
71-2_3016.65_9.027.wav_ASR	the the ball dress is transformed back into her rags
71-2_3025.677_7.746.wav_ASR	the pumpkin luckily she didn't get in it because i don't know what would have happened if she were actually inside the pumpkin
71-2_3033.917_1.461.wav_ASR	it's gone
71-2_3035.637_0.493.wav_ASR	it's a pumpkin
71-2_3036.697_2.343.wav_ASR	and the the horses are gone
71-2_3039.7_1.22.wav_ASR	they're rats again
71-2_3041.9_5.82.wav_ASR	so she walks home sneaks in the back because you know they don't really care what she's doing
71-2_3047.96_2.44.wav_ASR	and she could be out in the the barn or whatever
71-2_3051.18_1.98.wav_ASR	and she remembers her mom
71-2_3053.64_0.44.wav_ASR	slipper
71-2_3054.52_2.96.wav_ASR	hey i got to see what it was like to be on the other side of it
71-2_3058.28_1.562.wav_ASR	oh maybe i can be content
71-2_3059.842_2.694.wav_ASR	or maybe there's some other way that i can get out of here
71-2_3062.542_1.178.wav_ASR	at least i had
71-2_3064.362_9.62.wav_ASR	least i know that if i had the opportunity close i could walk into a situation at that level and i could
71-2_3075.322_2.431.wav_ASR	the meantime he's back in the palace
71-2_3078.142_1.402.wav_ASR	he's chasing after her
71-2_3079.8_11.914.wav_ASR	it's you know kind of the the science of of what's going on in his brain is got all these women and throwing themselves at him but all this one is playing hard to get because she left
71-2_3092.42_1.26.wav_ASR	so there's kind of a mystery there
71-2_3093.8_0.92.wav_ASR	and he's got the shoe
71-2_3095.48_0.44.wav_ASR	and he says
71-2_3096.62_2.419.wav_ASR	oh i want that woman
71-2_3099.039_1.554.wav_ASR	and he says that to his father
71-2_3101.459_0.874.wav_ASR	oh i will get married
71-2_3102.659_1.457.wav_ASR	oh do everything you want me to do
71-2_3104.319_1.26.wav_ASR	oh feel my organization
71-2_3106.019_2.317.wav_ASR	but i'm only gonna marry a woman i wanna be with
71-2_3108.479_1.188.wav_ASR	and i decided who it is
71-2_3109.899_0.481.wav_ASR	it's her
71-2_3110.579_0.492.wav_ASR	the prince
71-2_3111.559_1.82.wav_ASR	the mystery woman
71-2_3113.739_1.359.wav_ASR	and i've got her shoe
71-2_3115.098_9.104.wav_ASR	so all i hafta do now is go around and see if i can figure out who's foot will fit into that shoe
71-2_3124.478_2.226.wav_ASR	and then that will be the person
71-2_3126.704_14.559.wav_ASR	because he's beginning to understand in his mind that there are some limitations of this situation which is that there are some limitations on what he can do
71-2_3141.263_17.44.wav_ASR	and he's beginning to think if the their souls could just be soul souls that that would be something that it could just be soul souls that that would be something that it could exist
71-2_3158.75_4.86.wav_ASR	so he's thinking at this point he's thinking much more broadly than his father is
71-2_3163.91_2.82.wav_ASR	and so they've got this this this bird
71-2_3167.87_7.62.wav_ASR	if he can find a woman who's feet fit into those glass slippers he will know who that person is
71-2_3175.61_0.918.wav_ASR	and then he'll look at her
71-2_3176.528_4.36.wav_ASR	and he'll be able to know that that's the person that his is true
71-2_3181.928_1.599.wav_ASR	and that's the person that he will be
71-2_3184.23_8.169.wav_ASR	and because the way it's a science works is if you're rich you can marry down but but but but but but but it hasta be their choice
71-2_3192.59_7.512.wav_ASR	if you're poor and you wanna marry up you're gonna be used as some kind of social climeter
71-2_3200.21_5.812.wav_ASR	so you pretty much need someone to reach down in some way
71-2_3207.09_0.38.wav_ASR	so
71-2_3208.27_0.924.wav_ASR	he's male
71-2_3209.37_0.56.wav_ASR	and she's happy
71-2_3210.23_5.02.wav_ASR	and given the patient's limb of them she doesn't get to ask him
71-2_3215.67_1.58.wav_ASR	he hasta ask her
71-2_3217.53_2.64.wav_ASR	and this goes back two hundred years
71-2_3220.23_10.62.wav_ASR	and this is the way in which organism to their department in terms of what people could actually do
71-2_3232.95_1.66.wav_ASR	so he's going around
71-2_3234.63_9.058.wav_ASR	and of course this is clearly a really interesting way to find the part that he's actually looking for the mystery woman who got away
71-2_3244.37_1.53.wav_ASR	but he's no else what to do
71-2_3246.27_1.395.wav_ASR	and he's adventurous
71-2_3248.05_0.952.wav_ASR	you're the one i want
71-2_3249.19_4.215.wav_ASR	who saw the woman you know with the the great carriage
71-2_3253.405_1.7.wav_ASR	and he's called this doctor
71-2_3255.445_1.264.wav_ASR	everybody's looking for
71-2_3256.825_0.684.wav_ASR	they can't find her
71-2_3258.025_3.705.wav_ASR	so we're gonna start with the the shoe because he's got something in front of him
71-2_3262.625_10.345.wav_ASR	and they advise that he will be going city to city to see if he can find the woman that will fit the shoe
71-2_3273.59_2.54.wav_ASR	so of course the stepdaughters and
71-2_3276.77_4.492.wav_ASR	he he passes this by the night of the ball
71-2_3281.67_5.34.wav_ASR	but all we gotta do is get our feet to fit into that shoe
71-2_3287.15_7.66.wav_ASR	and of course they're looking at this in a really super simple kind of way because he finds the right woman
71-2_3298.01_6.16.wav_ASR	and clearly even if those shoes didn't fit the stepdaughters it wouldn't match
71-2_3304.47_1.08.wav_ASR	they're beautiful
71-2_3305.92_1.24.wav_ASR	they're be no camera
71-2_3307.5_1.43.wav_ASR	but you know they don't understand that
71-2_3309.14_4.5.wav_ASR	they're really behind in terms of understanding human relationships
71-2_3314.91_9.46.wav_ASR	one cinderella is she knows if she has the opportunity to connect with him again he can take her out of the situation that she's in
71-2_3324.63_1.94.wav_ASR	and they did connect
71-2_3326.99_0.66.wav_ASR	they shouldn't
71-2_3327.87_0.666.wav_ASR	what they did
71-2_3328.77_1.6.wav_ASR	it was very important
71-2_3331.15_16.88.wav_ASR	but for whatever reason because of the fairy godmother's she's been given that opportunity to step out of her role and move into the the prince's league
71-2_3349.85_4.94.wav_ASR	so when they come up to the house both of the stepdaughters go
71-2_3355.33_3.9.wav_ASR	they may try very hard to see if their feet will fit into the shoe
71-2_3359.65_1.118.wav_ASR	and they they don't
71-2_3361.07_2.251.wav_ASR	he's doing everything that he can
71-2_3363.39_2.46.wav_ASR	and it's this point the prince is just very dis
71-2_3366.67_1.663.wav_ASR	he doesn't think he's ever gonna find her
71-2_3368.45_4.78.wav_ASR	and he'll be stuck with somebody else that his father will probably arrange for him
71-2_3374.21_1.02.wav_ASR	and he finally said
71-2_3375.45_9.07.wav_ASR	there are any other woman in this house who could possibly be eligible for this
71-2_3385.34_2.26.wav_ASR	and cinderella steps over
71-2_3388.1_5.46.wav_ASR	and this is the braveest thing she's ever done because her stepmother's just gonna punish her for this after
71-2_3394.22_0.66.wav_ASR	and she said
71-2_3395.354_0.61.wav_ASR	oh i'm here
71-2_3396.64_1.68.wav_ASR	the stepmother turns and looks at him
71-2_3398.32_11.3.wav_ASR	and she's ready to you know clearly to punish her and and and banish her out of the barn prevent her not to eat for awhile and really really make her life miserable
71-2_3410.66_4.26.wav_ASR	but the person that's working with the prince says
71-2_3415.8_1.04.wav_ASR	he said everybody
71-2_3417.006_1.52.wav_ASR	come on now
71-2_3419.206_5.75.wav_ASR	and she steps forward to decide the fact that she's being glare at by the family members
71-2_3426.49_1.26.wav_ASR	and she sits down
71-2_3428.266_4.56.wav_ASR	and her foot fits the shoe
71-2_3433.786_1.224.wav_ASR	the prince looks at her
71-2_3435.486_0.884.wav_ASR	they're eyes me
71-2_3437.19_5.92.wav_ASR	and once again he knows he's he's wet
71-2_3444.51_11.84.wav_ASR	and at that point all of the power that the prince has to be able to protect her from her stepmother is kind of important
71-2_3457.31_6.494.wav_ASR	all of her beautiful clothes come back though we're beginning to think this might've been an illusion in the first place
71-2_3465.03_1.22.wav_ASR	the stepmother says
71-2_3467.17_0.966.wav_ASR	he's out of my hand
71-2_3468.27_3.048.wav_ASR	and i had no ability to pronounce her anymore
71-2_3471.91_15.74.wav_ASR	and the prince pulls her out of there and brings her back to the palace where she will be groomed to be a much higher status than she has been living
71-2_3488.11_2.18.wav_ASR	and she's gonna hafta learn how to
71-2_3490.38_2.51.wav_ASR	or she's gonna learn how to talk
71-2_3493.22_6.463.wav_ASR	but she's gonna have to learn how to conduct herself as a lady
71-2_3500.06_5.22.wav_ASR	all the things that are associated with a higher social class
71-2_3505.28_7.11.wav_ASR	but but because they connected at a human level this is gonna work
71-2_3569.68_4.16.wav_ASR	it was just thinking about telling you about the one i told you last
71-2_3574.16_1.744.wav_ASR	so i hafta come up with the new one and that
71-2_3575.904_16.746.wav_ASR	when i was in the third grade which means i was about eight i was very good with being able to read a lot
71-2_3594.17_4.66.wav_ASR	but there were some deals that i was not completely clear about
71-2_3599.49_5.1.wav_ASR	and one of those is what is a quarter after on a clock
71-2_3606.01_7.8.wav_ASR	mean i certainly knew that the shorter hand hand was the hour
71-2_3614.27_3.18.wav_ASR	and the umbrella was the minute
71-2_3618.41_10.9.wav_ASR	but in my eight year old brain when someone said twenty five after or a quarter after it went twenty
71-2_3629.95_0.94.wav_ASR	didn't mean fifty
71-2_3632.237_7.116.wav_ASR	and what happened is my older sister had stayed home sick that day
71-2_3640.43_4.54.wav_ASR	and i was sposta go to her elementary school teacher
71-2_3645.277_2.053.wav_ASR	and she was in the fifth grade
71-2_3647.95_6.86.wav_ASR	and i was sposta get her home home work and bring it home to her so that she could do a work and she could return in the next day
71-2_3655.69_1.8.wav_ASR	and so i went to my teacher and said
71-2_3657.81_4.4.wav_ASR	and i'm sposta go to miss's feeder
71-2_3662.55_3.64.wav_ASR	and i'm sposta pick up my sisters home
71-2_3667.09_0.66.wav_ASR	and she said
71-2_3668.13_1.372.wav_ASR	why didn't you go at core after
71-2_3669.502_1.648.wav_ASR	so i said
71-2_3671.37_0.632.wav_ASR	yeah i will
71-2_3672.79_7.687.wav_ASR	of course after was twenty five minutes after because in my mind that's what made sense
71-2_3680.63_1.36.wav_ASR	the quarter's twenty five minutes
71-2_3682.55_2.16.wav_ASR	it's a quarter is worth twenty five cents
71-2_3685.29_6.464.wav_ASR	so quarter after would be three twenty five not three fifteen which is what she's saying
71-2_3691.83_1.241.wav_ASR	fourth after the hour
71-2_3693.83_6.8.wav_ASR	so i waited until three twenty five which is close
71-2_3701.57_3.218.wav_ASR	it's way too late for me to be going and doing what i'm sposta be doing
71-2_3704.71_1.76.wav_ASR	and i've sposta done it ten minutes earlier
71-2_3706.77_5.92.wav_ASR	and i'm watching the clock until exactly three twenty five and getting up and going to do what i'm sposta do
71-2_3713.17_1.54.wav_ASR	and i ran out
71-2_3715.13_4.3.wav_ASR	of course it's a mess because i'm missing the end of my class
71-2_3720.41_4.7.wav_ASR	her class master's class is closed down
71-2_3726.15_4.02.wav_ASR	so i get back to my class probably at three thirty five
71-2_3730.99_3.236.wav_ASR	my teacher is still waiting there because my stuff is still in the desk
71-2_3734.91_1.24.wav_ASR	did you wait so long
71-2_3736.33_0.6.wav_ASR	and she said
71-2_3737.07_2.17.wav_ASR	exactly when you told me to go
71-2_3739.78_1.66.wav_ASR	you told me to go at four o'clock
71-2_3742.38_0.58.wav_ASR	and she said
71-2_3743.24_2.52.wav_ASR	oh no you didn't go until three twenty five
71-2_3746.02_0.42.wav_ASR	and i said
71-2_3746.78_1.46.wav_ASR	but isn't that course of action
71-2_3749.18_19.93.wav_ASR	and so at the age of eight i understood finally that when adult's say a clock that they mean fifteen minutes after an hour and not twenty five minutes after an hour
71-2_3769.95_0.381.wav_ASR	house
71-2_3770.47_0.576.wav_ASR	it's i don't know
71-2_3783.83_0.927.wav_ASR	well to me
71-2_3784.77_0.667.wav_ASR	it was easy
71-2_3785.65_0.876.wav_ASR	still makes sense
71-2_3786.87_2.118.wav_ASR	you know a quarter after the hour
71-2_3788.988_1.9.wav_ASR	oh my goodness
71-2_3791.248_1.687.wav_ASR	they just weren't clear about it
71-2_3793.668_2.282.wav_ASR	now that i actually talked back to him
71-2_3796.328_1.262.wav_ASR	mean i was in a conference
71-2_3797.748_1.362.wav_ASR	you're never talk back to anybody
71-2_3799.368_1.8.wav_ASR	but i was just really confused
71-2_3809.35_6.62.wav_ASR	you think of a good bread
71-2_3816.149_18.351.wav_ASR	to talk about this story i think i'm going to talk about when i learned how to root a turkey because at the time when i did it i was asked if i could bake the bird
71-2_3836.08_11.38.wav_ASR	and of course growing up in an extended family with which we had very very huge thanksgiving dinners i never made my own thanksgiving dinner by myself
71-2_3847.78_2.32.wav_ASR	generally we would go to my grandmother's house
71-2_3850.98_1.12.wav_ASR	and she had eleven children
71-2_3852.94_2.427.wav_ASR	so our job
71-2_3855.367_3.059.wav_ASR	my father was the second oldest of that family
71-2_3859.04_2.22.wav_ASR	or job was to bring some pies
71-2_3861.92_7.327.wav_ASR	and usually we would bring something else rather than it be candy bar or something else bread
71-2_3869.707_2.393.wav_ASR	but we never made the tour
71-2_3872.607_2.173.wav_ASR	you are never spontaneous for doing anything
71-2_3874.78_1.654.wav_ASR	that and we're we're talking
71-2_3876.434_0.914.wav_ASR	they're playing a football
71-2_3877.82_5.48.wav_ASR	you know i'd hang up with my in the kitchen with the women because they were kind of restricted that
71-2_3883.46_1.96.wav_ASR	the man would be in the living room watching football
71-2_3886.28_4.902.wav_ASR	yeah you would just try to do with those generator
71-2_3891.42_2.44.wav_ASR	but anyway i was by myself
71-2_3893.937_6.46.wav_ASR	oh i think it was a center in
71-2_3903.017_2.6.wav_ASR	and i was working as a waiter
71-2_3906.217_1.753.wav_ASR	and i didn't have a car
71-2_3909.03_2.46.wav_ASR	and i couldn't get enough time off from work
71-2_3911.917_1.736.wav_ASR	and i didn't have enough cinderella there
71-2_3913.653_4.9.wav_ASR	so for whatever reason i hadta work on wednesdays before thursday
71-2_3919.253_1.48.wav_ASR	and i was gonna be surprised
71-2_3920.873_2.933.wav_ASR	but i was gonna miss this big family event
71-2_3924.413_4.96.wav_ASR	but i decided that i was still going to make sure that i had the trap
71-2_3929.773_1.74.wav_ASR	but i still had trouble
71-2_3931.715_1.84.wav_ASR	but i still had
71-2_3934.135_1.48.wav_ASR	that i still had dress
71-2_3935.995_1.437.wav_ASR	and those are the things i liked anyway
71-2_3937.995_2.438.wav_ASR	so i was gonna go through this because now i'm an adult right
71-2_3940.455_1.144.wav_ASR	and i know how to do all that
71-2_3941.995_1.475.wav_ASR	and why shouldn't i be able to do it
71-2_3943.535_0.973.wav_ASR	it can't be hard
71-2_3945.135_1.145.wav_ASR	it comes out the
71-2_3946.495_1.92.wav_ASR	it looks like you turn the oven on
71-2_3948.615_1.065.wav_ASR	you put the turkey
71-2_3949.895_1.065.wav_ASR	they leave it in for a long time
71-2_3951.06_1.38.wav_ASR	five and eventually you pull it
71-2_3952.98_1.427.wav_ASR	and then you eat it right
71-2_3954.407_0.765.wav_ASR	can do that
71-2_3956.5_5.3.wav_ASR	so the tuesday before thanksgiving after i'm college
71-2_3962.12_0.88.wav_ASR	and everyone's saying
71-2_3963.12_1.013.wav_ASR	you're not gonna be here
71-2_3964.3_1.612.wav_ASR	you can't believe you're not gonna be your own
71-2_3965.912_1.841.wav_ASR	and feeling all confused and all this
71-2_3967.94_2.64.wav_ASR	but i get how i pick up this term
71-2_3970.948_2.557.wav_ASR	and i don't get a particularly big one
71-2_3973.708_0.995.wav_ASR	it's pretty big
71-2_3974.748_3.832.wav_ASR	probably twenty pounds which is certainly more than i need
71-2_3979.388_1.599.wav_ASR	but you know i don't know
71-2_3981.128_5.18.wav_ASR	smaller than the ones that my family has ever used for thanksgiving
71-2_3986.648_1.44.wav_ASR	so i pick up this
71-2_3989.32_4.94.wav_ASR	after i get home from work on wednesday i pull it out of the fridge
71-2_3994.86_1.6.wav_ASR	you're kinda see where i'm going with this
71-2_3997.14_1.16.wav_ASR	amputating out of the tree
71-2_3998.92_0.655.wav_ASR	and say
71-2_3999.94_8.707.wav_ASR	yeah i think i probably if i put it in the morning on thursday morning i should be able to eat probably like four o'clock in the afternoon
71-2_4008.6_3.427.wav_ASR	and and you know how to make pies and all the other stuff
71-2_4012.36_2.28.wav_ASR	stick it in the
71-2_4015.16_2.54.wav_ASR	and i put tie foam over it
71-2_4018.12_1.74.wav_ASR	and i got the temperature core
71-2_4020.98_0.76.wav_ASR	put it in
71-2_4022.48_2.3.wav_ASR	and you know in the meantime i'm getting really hungry
71-2_4025.22_1.08.wav_ASR	you know the day is going on
71-2_4026.96_2.58.wav_ASR	the other one smells really good
71-2_4030.16_1.799.wav_ASR	oh my favorite got the pies that are
71-2_4032.82_2.322.wav_ASR	because i have time to bake them
71-2_4035.7_1.44.wav_ASR	and i go to the school
71-2_4037.36_0.82.wav_ASR	and i'm watching tv
71-2_4038.6_1.326.wav_ASR	and so it's about four o'clock
71-2_4040.14_5.623.wav_ASR	and i invited my next door neighbor to come over and help thanksgiving with me
71-2_4045.6_2.7.wav_ASR	and i pull out the other
71-2_4048.88_8.18.wav_ASR	and i open the other door pull out the the turkey and take off the the chicken and take off the tin foil
71-2_4058.22_5.156.wav_ASR	and all of a sudden i notice it's still kind of row on the top
71-2_4063.76_1.56.wav_ASR	it's
71-2_4065.473_3.02.wav_ASR	and what apparently i didn't understand you hadta follow them
71-2_4068.773_3.506.wav_ASR	and i i didn't know that there's actually a process that yeah
71-2_4072.673_10.555.wav_ASR	so what i have is a turkey which is a turkey which overcooked on the top part of it
71-2_4083.413_1.1.wav_ASR	it's blood everywhere
71-2_4084.791_4.6.wav_ASR	oh you know especially you know when you wake up you have clear june
71-2_4089.731_1.877.wav_ASR	oh i'm having blood coming out of it
71-2_4092.3_1.672.wav_ASR	so i got my next door neighbor's phone number
71-2_4094.631_1.127.wav_ASR	so what are we gonna eat
71-2_4095.771_0.429.wav_ASR	and i said
71-2_4096.271_1.769.wav_ASR	well it looks like it's not done yet
71-2_4098.231_1.569.wav_ASR	and i don't know why's he's taking this long
71-2_4101.011_1.629.wav_ASR	and i said
71-2_4103.091_0.989.wav_ASR	oh what's to see the puppy
71-2_4104.66_1.34.wav_ASR	so i put it back in the
71-2_4106.3_0.82.wav_ASR	we eat the pub
71-2_4107.6_2.94.wav_ASR	we start eating you know whatever i've got in the house
71-2_4110.92_3.32.wav_ASR	and i keep opening the other door and checking it
71-2_4114.46_1.1.wav_ASR	oh not done
71-2_4115.9_3.62.wav_ASR	and then finally at this point my my neighbor said
71-2_4119.66_2.687.wav_ASR	you know i'm not really hungry anymore because we've been eating
71-2_4122.347_5.32.wav_ASR	and i pick i had some macaroni and cheese in the refrigerator
71-2_4127.947_0.653.wav_ASR	we're eating that
71-2_4128.987_0.853.wav_ASR	they're always had the phone
71-2_4130.887_1.513.wav_ASR	you know we eating other stuff
71-2_4132.587_2.053.wav_ASR	they were drinking beer pretty much at that point
71-2_4135.127_1.673.wav_ASR	and it still just wasn't done
71-2_4136.987_0.32.wav_ASR	what is it
71-2_4137.427_1.789.wav_ASR	think there's something wrong with my elbow
71-2_4139.216_4.64.wav_ASR	for whatever reason this bird did not
71-2_4144.716_6.64.wav_ASR	so basically i finally took it out of the oven and stuck it back in the refrigerator
71-2_4152.1_1.576.wav_ASR	it was half cool
71-2_4154.1_6.54.wav_ASR	and then i found out the next day from my aunt that it was sposta be thought probably three or four days and a half
71-2_4161.66_3.14.wav_ASR	that's the only way that it's cooked evenly
71-2_4164.8_10.968.wav_ASR	and i never told anybody other than my aunt that that my uncle did not work out is not because i forgot the thought
71-2_4175.98_2.66.wav_ASR	but because i told you be eleven just didn't work
71-2_4178.98_0.94.wav_ASR	and that's the
71-2_4180.26_1.499.wav_ASR	but that's the one i went with right
71-2_4181.86_0.46.wav_ASR	and i did not
71-2_4182.62_1.64.wav_ASR	they would've laughed at me forever
71-2_4184.269_5.704.wav_ASR	they've recruited me for decks for not knowing something as basic as that
71-2_4190.749_3.091.wav_ASR	but it's the first bird i ever tried
71-2_4194.709_2.56.wav_ASR	there's there you needta tell you the details
71-2_4197.749_2.931.wav_ASR	maybe there's more involved than just sticking in the tree
71-2_4201.309_1.4.wav_ASR	so anyway yeah
71-2_4202.869_1.276.wav_ASR	but i didn't even tell you
71-2_4204.145_0.66.wav_ASR	but i didn't take it
71-2_4205.385_11.22.wav_ASR	the neck was actually inside paper and was stuck inside the tree
71-2_4217.465_4.355.wav_ASR	so when i finally was able to get it out i had paper in there too on top
71-2_4222.245_1.467.wav_ASR	the kind of match
71-2_4223.712_2.033.wav_ASR	oh eventually i ate it
71-2_4225.772_5.36.wav_ASR	and i i just hacked it up then kind of cooked it in
71-2_4231.613_1.392.wav_ASR	but i use it all
71-2_4244.36_0.39.wav_ASR	me
71-2_4246.12_3.22.wav_ASR	oh okay
71-2_4250.31_12.91.wav_ASR	going to talk about hotel that i stayed in when i was living in kootenay and and was traveling with five other people
71-2_4263.273_6.26.wav_ASR	now in this particular case what had happened as we were on christmas break
71-2_4270.133_3.68.wav_ASR	so we had a month off in which there were no classes
71-2_4274.793_1.429.wav_ASR	and so all of a sudden
71-2_4276.413_2.08.wav_ASR	we're about twenty five of us there
71-2_4278.663_5.439.wav_ASR	we were between the ages of nineteen and twenty one and were in university
71-2_4284.483_8.28.wav_ASR	and we have the ability to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
71-2_4293.323_0.72.wav_ASR	you're basically
71-2_4294.543_3.437.wav_ASR	but i can't remember what it cost at this point
71-2_4297.98_2.54.wav_ASR	but i think it was about a hundred dollars you paid
71-2_4300.82_16.44.wav_ASR	and you could essentially go anywhere as far as far south asreece and as far north as philly as long as it was on this this rail
71-2_4317.626_3.34.wav_ASR	so you know we had all these ways of trying to do it
71-2_4321.286_2.024.wav_ASR	you know we'd sleep on on trains
71-2_4323.546_4.404.wav_ASR	we would take things at night so that we wouldn't have to worry about a
71-2_4328.866_1.9.wav_ASR	but we were now
71-2_4331.086_2.44.wav_ASR	we were several of us that were traveling
71-2_4333.686_1.58.wav_ASR	it was with a friend called firstnamek
71-2_4335.298_4.36.wav_ASR	and we were connecting in with firstnames and firstnamek
71-2_4339.721_2.975.wav_ASR	and and we were coming
71-2_4342.838_1.313.wav_ASR	they traveled from somewhere else
71-2_4344.198_2.045.wav_ASR	we're all gonna meet together in Rome
71-2_4346.718_4.949.wav_ASR	and we figured we would all stay in a hotel together to save money you know
71-2_4351.738_2.52.wav_ASR	you would have two bread
71-2_4354.57_1.472.wav_ASR	so there was a cat
71-2_4356.47_1.518.wav_ASR	and one of us would sleep with firstnamek
71-2_4357.988_3.735.wav_ASR	and then two women would be in the other side
71-2_4362.65_1.8.wav_ASR	so it's new year's eureka right
71-2_4364.61_1.672.wav_ASR	because this is christmas
71-2_4366.73_2.06.wav_ASR	we arrive in river

71-2_4378.485_2.025.wav_ASR	we all got in within half an hour of each other
71-2_4380.725_0.585.wav_ASR	we connect
71-2_4381.31_17.334.wav_ASR	the first thing we would always do is go to the the infection center in the training station and get the maps and find out what's going on in the city and where the chief hospitals and you know basically what we're gonna be doing
71-2_4399.31_1.66.wav_ASR	there's a guy there working

71-2_4448.786_0.842.wav_ASR	but that's not what happened
71-2_4450.606_1.32.wav_ASR	so we get to our hotel
71-2_4453.086_0.895.wav_ASR	and we check in
71-2_4454.966_4.62.wav_ASR	and the guy behind the desk looked at all of us and said
71-2_4459.59_1.88.wav_ASR	you all wanna be in one room together
71-2_4462.21_0.62.wav_ASR	and we said
71-2_4463.448_1.886.wav_ASR	one one room two beds
71-2_4466.53_1.558.wav_ASR	and he looked at cuban
71-2_4468.088_2.082.wav_ASR	and and he pulled him aside and said
71-2_4470.79_1.3.wav_ASR	you must not be allergic
71-2_4472.41_4.094.wav_ASR	if i were in that room i would not be able to sleep the entire night
71-2_4476.504_3.19.wav_ASR	they're the right night with all of these beautiful women around
71-2_4480.57_2.338.wav_ASR	and he hadn't come out yet
71-2_4482.944_3.806.wav_ASR	but it about a year later after that when we all had a reunion
71-2_4487.104_0.926.wav_ASR	you know i'm i'm gay
71-2_4488.81_0.614.wav_ASR	and i said
71-2_4489.544_1.514.wav_ASR	oh we we didn't know that
71-2_4491.584_4.638.wav_ASR	then i was thinking at the time you know he he he actually didn't know he was gay
71-2_4496.25_7.099.wav_ASR	but he said one of the things that made clear to him that he was gay as when that italian man had said
71-2_4504.19_3.358.wav_ASR	we wouldn't be able to sleep if i were in the room with these beautiful women
71-2_4508.07_0.96.wav_ASR	and he's thinking
71-2_4509.29_1.838.wav_ASR	you know i'm not interested in anything
71-2_4511.51_1.94.wav_ASR	yeah definitely
71-2_4513.97_1.867.wav_ASR	well maybe there's a reason for that
71-2_4515.85_1.695.wav_ASR	yeah but that
71-2_4518.19_2.637.wav_ASR	so we i actually stopped with firstnamek
71-2_4520.91_0.704.wav_ASR	oh that was
71-2_4523.37_1.48.wav_ASR	and there was no
71-2_4525.51_3.045.wav_ASR	they didn't matter i mean who we're gonna sleep with
71-2_4528.59_1.436.wav_ASR	he was like my brother at that point
71-2_4530.79_1.74.wav_ASR	so firstnamek and i slept in one bed
71-2_4532.73_0.64.wav_ASR	it was a dog
71-2_4533.83_2.42.wav_ASR	and firstnamec and firstnamek slip in the other one

71-2_4563.963_5.82.wav_ASR	and the whole thing at the party became the focus of
71-2_4569.795_5.22.wav_ASR	so this guy is sleeping with all three of you in the hotel
71-2_4575.455_8.129.wav_ASR	well that's all we talked about all night was just that firstnamek had three different women that he was having sex with

71-2_4586.535_3.105.wav_ASR	wish i could be in an amazing man and travel with three women
71-2_4589.64_1.073.wav_ASR	and you know

71-2_4593.08_2.472.wav_ASR	oh oh so embarrassing by the whole thing
71-2_4595.68_0.879.wav_ASR	we
71-2_4597.78_4.75.wav_ASR	what's interesting is on the way back we stopped again in the the bathroom
71-2_4602.76_3.63.wav_ASR	firstnamek came out of the bathroom the men's bathroom and said
71-2_4607.06_1.72.wav_ASR	just had the string's account

71-2_4611.66_1.84.wav_ASR	well i was at the
71-2_4614.02_1.751.wav_ASR	and i was standing there
71-2_4615.94_0.733.wav_ASR	and i was peanu
71-2_4617.72_1.59.wav_ASR	and all of a sudden this man came
71-2_4619.54_4.24.wav_ASR	and he could have gone to the other side of the river
71-2_4624.08_1.411.wav_ASR	came and stood right next to me
71-2_4626.74_0.6.wav_ASR	and he said
71-2_4627.405_1.298.wav_ASR	and i don't know what that mean

71-2_4637.563_0.429.wav_ASR	oh
71-2_4638.163_1.275.wav_ASR	so some help
71-2_4640.283_2.322.wav_ASR	thinking about that a year later it kind of made sense
71-2_4642.723_0.997.wav_ASR	at the time i says
71-2_4643.84_0.556.wav_ASR	excuse me
71-2_4644.543_1.18.wav_ASR	be this is what it's telling me
71-2_4645.732_10.149.wav_ASR	we just thought atomic men were so strange that some of them would not be able to sleep in a fully closed woman and not be able to sleep when he's exhausted because
71-2_4656.872_1.771.wav_ASR	and i could not sleep if i were in that room
71-2_4658.952_2.411.wav_ASR	and i just couldn't manage all those women around them
71-2_4661.432_1.043.wav_ASR	we're sharing a bathroom
71-2_4663.072_0.5.wav_ASR	oh my

71-2_4676.085_0.796.wav_ASR	yeah
71-2_4677.505_0.76.wav_ASR	that was nice
71-2_4683.67_0.73.wav_ASR	thank you
71-2_4684.79_1.88.wav_ASR	we've already talked about my okay
71-2_4687.29_1.19.wav_ASR	so i come up with the different words
71-2_4688.98_22.04.wav_ASR	oh i useta have this thing that i would do to family members and friends which involved them in restaurants on their holiday days or in particular
71-2_4711.28_5.98.wav_ASR	and what i would do is i would usually go quiet
71-2_4718.12_0.593.wav_ASR	we've get up
71-2_4718.88_1.542.wav_ASR	and i would exercise myself on the tape
71-2_4720.7_0.485.wav_ASR	and i would go
71-2_4721.32_1.92.wav_ASR	and i would talk to the a waitress
71-2_4723.38_1.18.wav_ASR	and i would say something like
71-2_4724.78_0.758.wav_ASR	it's my cousin
71-2_4725.64_1.14.wav_ASR	it's his birthday today
71-2_4727.48_2.1.wav_ASR	he doesn't like any attention
71-2_4729.698_4.925.wav_ASR	so is there any point in time in which you could bring us a cake
71-2_4734.623_3.695.wav_ASR	and then we could really appreciate him by singing really loudly
71-2_4738.31_3.62.wav_ASR	and usually the waitress step they're always
71-2_4742.318_0.971.wav_ASR	we didn't love you
71-2_4743.298_0.762.wav_ASR	that would be fun
71-2_4744.738_1.792.wav_ASR	so i had this thing about doing that
71-2_4746.63_5.9.wav_ASR	and and very often i would bring my own candles the kind that don't blow out
71-2_4752.99_5.848.wav_ASR	oh yeah because then you can really really appreciate people
71-2_4758.97_1.497.wav_ASR	yeah that was my phone

71-2_4769.48_3.76.wav_ASR	he's always kind of quiet and and shy
71-2_4774.06_7.648.wav_ASR	so i decided that what we should really do is we should call a lot of attention to him because this would be good for him
71-2_4782.483_4.66.wav_ASR	so there were about fifteen of us there in the family
71-2_4787.403_2.28.wav_ASR	we weren't all sitting in the same
71-2_4790.743_1.267.wav_ASR	you were in the same boat
71-2_4792.783_6.78.wav_ASR	but i decided that would actually add to the event if we had people singing from a distance around him
71-2_4800.425_7.26.wav_ASR	oh i i took my niece and nephew with me to talk to the waitress
71-2_4808.085_1.875.wav_ASR	and firstnamem was then sick

71-2_4965.96_1.081.wav_ASR	oh i'm gonna remember this
71-2_4967.18_0.36.wav_ASR	and i said
71-2_4967.76_1.097.wav_ASR	was it a surprise
71-2_4968.88_0.538.wav_ASR	he says
71-2_4969.54_2.689.wav_ASR	it was not a surprise when i heard firstnamem say
71-2_4972.7_2.78.wav_ASR	remember to sing very very loud
71-2_4976.56_11.193.wav_ASR	so i you know i i think i handed the waitress i think i gave her her like twenty dollars or something what she had done because she carried it off so well
71-2_4988.7_0.52.wav_ASR	yeah
71-2_4989.46_1.132.wav_ASR	it was so much fun
71-2_4990.7_0.32.wav_ASR	and she said
71-2_4991.1_1.881.wav_ASR	finally it's oh much fun
71-2_4992.981_3.44.wav_ASR	and and dune just looked at me and just
71-2_4998.102_3.085.wav_ASR	well alright yeah anyway that was fine
71-2_5001.681_0.427.wav_ASR	but it's
71-2_5016.87_9.94.wav_ASR	back in the days when i would make peanut butter and jelly sandwich because of course i can't anymore for all sorts of reasons
71-2_5026.95_5.193.wav_ASR	slipper it's saturday and too much shoe and all the rest of it
71-2_5032.23_5.632.wav_ASR	but back in the days when i would've done this i would have started out with the bread
71-2_5038.61_13.295.wav_ASR	and i would have toasted it because the test second of toast of toast works better for me than it does with a toasted bread when it comes to peanut butter and jelly
71-2_5052.65_3.64.wav_ASR	so i would begin by putting it in the toaster
71-2_5056.23_6.16.wav_ASR	and while it's tossing up i would pull out the peanut butter and the jelly
71-2_5063.89_6.546.wav_ASR	when the bread comes out of the toaster i would begin with the peanut butter
71-2_5070.71_0.899.wav_ASR	that goes on the board
71-2_5071.89_4.232.wav_ASR	but i would pull out some peanut butter
71-2_5076.47_2.8.wav_ASR	and i would spread it evenly on the bread
71-2_5079.93_2.64.wav_ASR	then i would take the other piece of toast
71-2_5083.17_7.54.wav_ASR	and i would take a spoon and spoon out some jelly
71-2_5091.25_1.174.wav_ASR	write it around even
71-2_5093.29_1.54.wav_ASR	and then put the two of them together
71-2_5095.33_3.74.wav_ASR	and probably slice it before i eat it
71-2_5100.37_1.46.wav_ASR	but i don't eat things like that anymore
71-2_5102.25_1.58.wav_ASR	that's how i would do it
71-2_5111.35_0.5.wav_ASR	okay
71-2_5112.173_4.003.wav_ASR	well i think we talk about this last week
71-2_5116.353_4.662.wav_ASR	and i'm not done my laundry since last week which means i really needta do it at this point
71-2_5122.17_24.64.wav_ASR	when i do laundry what i'm able to do is not separate them from color and white because i've gotten into the point that i only buy clothes that can all be washed in cold water which is also much better for the environment
71-2_5147.64_14.38.wav_ASR	so all of my dirty laundry is already put aside because as clothes begin to fall the smell test they end up in my
71-2_5163.84_1.68.wav_ASR	so when it's time to do laundry
71-2_5205.68_2.96.wav_ASR	my plan is probably tomorrow after
71-2_5208.96_5.54.wav_ASR	have a break between two different points that will allow me to do that
71-2_5214.8_4.46.wav_ASR	what i'm going to do is i pull into the laundry which is on the east side
71-2_5221.0_3.28.wav_ASR	oh i think it's about twenty one hundred
71-2_5224.612_5.38.wav_ASR	and i will walk into a medium size washing machine
71-2_5230.452_2.529.wav_ASR	all of my laundry
71-2_5233.212_2.606.wav_ASR	well not separate it by color or white
71-2_5236.572_4.435.wav_ASR	and i will then add the soup sorry the soup at the top of it
71-2_5241.89_6.96.wav_ASR	then i will put in enough carrots to be able to begin the cycle
71-2_5249.67_3.44.wav_ASR	and i will wash on my clothes on top
71-2_5253.83_7.3.wav_ASR	after the core's are in i push the cold water water
71-2_5261.412_5.86.wav_ASR	and then i take note of the fact that it will take twenty five minutes for it to walk
71-2_5300.51_7.94.wav_ASR	because it's tumors and sweaters and things and sweat shirts that will take longer to to dry
71-2_5309.73_7.36.wav_ASR	and then i threw it all back in the hamper and take it home and then sometimes unload it or put it away
71-2_5317.17_8.72.wav_ASR	and sometimes i just take right out of the clean hamper and put it on my my my body or my bed or whatever i need it
71-2_5335.726_1.6.wav_ASR	thank you
71-2_5338.086_0.904.wav_ASR	well i've never done that
71-2_5339.206_1.26.wav_ASR	and i have tried
71-2_5341.05_1.916.wav_ASR	we'll make very clear that i have tried
71-2_5343.826_8.14.wav_ASR	and i have not ever succeeded in doing so for different reasons
71-2_5352.99_2.016.wav_ASR	if i wanted to do it correct
71-2_5355.43_3.92.wav_ASR	and this is what it says on the seed
71-2_5360.33_1.64.wav_ASR	which has never worked for me
71-2_5362.41_2.88.wav_ASR	but this is essentially the way that we would do it
71-2_5365.51_1.04.wav_ASR	and i would get
71-2_5368.81_1.36.wav_ASR	or i would get
71-2_5370.83_2.38.wav_ASR	and i would go to a plant
71-2_5374.88_3.677.wav_ASR	and there is one that's about a mile and half from where i live
71-2_5378.64_3.28.wav_ASR	and you buy a special type of
71-2_5384.1_1.523.wav_ASR	it it it comes in a bag
71-2_5385.8_1.105.wav_ASR	and i think it's it's
71-2_5387.32_6.933.wav_ASR	it's it's it's final enough that you should be able to grow things on it
71-2_5394.253_3.88.wav_ASR	and and i would put this into a pot
71-2_5398.493_12.547.wav_ASR	except water it's essential water will be able to drain out into a tray
71-2_5412.06_6.94.wav_ASR	put the pot near a window so that there's enough
71-2_5420.54_3.72.wav_ASR	and what i would do is make sure that the
71-2_5424.56_4.012.wav_ASR	first i would read the directions on the seat package which i've done before
71-2_5429.36_2.358.wav_ASR	you hafta go down about two inches
71-2_5431.718_2.05.wav_ASR	you take a seed
71-2_5434.438_1.243.wav_ASR	you place it
71-2_5436.118_0.689.wav_ASR	you cover
71-2_5437.218_1.782.wav_ASR	you water it
71-2_5439.278_1.558.wav_ASR	and then you leave it alone
71-2_5441.258_2.82.wav_ASR	and supposedly nature takes its course
71-2_5444.438_5.88.wav_ASR	in my particular situation one time i didn't have enough sun
71-2_5451.69_10.26.wav_ASR	another time i suddenly overwatered it to the point that the the soil was so saturated that the seed
71-2_5463.05_8.069.wav_ASR	and i think the other time it just was too cold in my apartment to be able to spread out in the way that it was sposta
71-2_5471.119_2.542.wav_ASR	but i've seen other people do it
71-2_5473.819_1.78.wav_ASR	and i know the process includes
71-2_5475.839_4.031.wav_ASR	have just been able to actually do it in a way that makes it actually work
71-2_5480.75_10.703.wav_ASR	so yeah i'm still in the technical state of stage of understanding of what you're sposta be able to do
71-2_5491.453_11.589.wav_ASR	but i haven't yet figured out how to keep the soil dry enough so that it can it can sprout without me overwatering it to the point that i write it
71-2_5503.85_5.443.wav_ASR	so i think there's a balance i haven't yet achieved to be able to do it
84-1_17.07_2.48.wav_ASR	one of my favorite trips
84-1_19.816_4.091.wav_ASR	my wife and i have two sons that are older now
84-1_24.096_5.94.wav_ASR	and for a number of years we went skiing in utah in parks
84-1_31.276_2.24.wav_ASR	and i really enjoyed the operation
84-1_33.838_6.2.wav_ASR	so my youngest was probably about three years old and my oldest was probably about four
84-1_40.738_1.181.wav_ASR	oh it's probably a little later
84-1_42.198_2.46.wav_ASR	he five and
84-1_45.878_4.42.wav_ASR	it was just so much fun to get out there and and
84-1_50.529_3.88.wav_ASR	but i i could ski already but my but my two kids
84-1_55.149_1.45.wav_ASR	my wife ski a little bit
84-1_56.809_3.24.wav_ASR	my two kids became pretty good singers
84-1_60.329_3.354.wav_ASR	pretty sure that a lot of them was
84-1_63.693_8.407.wav_ASR	we had a guide when we were in in in
84-1_72.333_1.915.wav_ASR	just lost the name of the place
84-1_74.633_3.58.wav_ASR	and when we were in the ucs
84-1_78.653_2.88.wav_ASR	and we were guided with him for a number of years
84-1_81.538_1.66.wav_ASR	he did a really good job
84-1_83.198_9.633.wav_ASR	and i hope that will give you a little bit of sense of how much i enjoyed skiing with them while when i could
84-1_100.218_1.397.wav_ASR	it it was very nice
84-1_127.149_12.52.wav_ASR	well i just got excited to be part of the bar again in virtual
84-1_141.089_3.08.wav_ASR	and i would say my my skills
84-1_144.711_5.549.wav_ASR	my skills are pretty good
84-1_150.311_2.822.wav_ASR	they're never gonna be great as they once were
84-1_153.811_8.199.wav_ASR	so i would say on a scale of one to ten right now i would say i'm probably a
84-1_162.21_3.04.wav_ASR	so i feel like i made a lot of progress
84-1_165.81_5.761.wav_ASR	but i know that there's more progress i needta make especially with with with big words
84-1_172.07_1.91.wav_ASR	big words can be difficult for me
84-1_174.17_3.53.wav_ASR	so i do see a speech therapist once a week
84-1_177.77_3.733.wav_ASR	and she's been extremely extremely helpful for me
84-1_181.503_0.887.wav_ASR	her
84-1_182.39_6.734.wav_ASR	and i also have somebody do some some work out with me
84-1_189.203_1.429.wav_ASR	the two of them are just great
84-1_196.9_1.27.wav_ASR	oh i remember that pretty well
84-1_207.12_2.95.wav_ASR	well my wife was away for the week
84-1_210.39_2.78.wav_ASR	he had a house in oxford maryland
84-1_214.15_3.64.wav_ASR	and i remember that weekend because i hadta work
84-1_217.968_4.82.wav_ASR	and i thought the biggest thing we i could do for the weekend was to stay home
84-1_223.738_8.03.wav_ASR	so i think she probably went down there on maybe wednesday or thursday
84-1_232.508_2.66.wav_ASR	and i came home from work on friday
84-1_236.128_0.848.wav_ASR	had dinner
84-1_236.976_0.998.wav_ASR	but i did some work
84-1_238.176_2.0.wav_ASR	and i get up the next morning
84-1_240.536_5.24.wav_ASR	but that was the thirtieth of
84-1_247.676_1.721.wav_ASR	and i felt pretty good
84-1_249.716_1.188.wav_ASR	went about my day
84-1_251.576_2.08.wav_ASR	and i went out for a bicycle ride
84-1_254.296_1.0.wav_ASR	and i came home
84-1_255.22_20.6.wav_ASR	and that night i think a week maybe after the flood was killed in in mini
84-1_276.504_5.66.wav_ASR	and so on saturday night i went to bed a little bit early
84-1_282.524_4.46.wav_ASR	well i i thought there might be some bicycle
84-1_287.724_3.66.wav_ASR	and i also thought it would be helpful in the mornings
84-1_291.464_1.784.wav_ASR	so i could clean up a little bit
84-1_293.7_2.69.wav_ASR	so we live in a fairly nice area
84-1_297.14_2.43.wav_ASR	and i went to bed around ten thirty
84-1_300.6_5.7.wav_ASR	and that night saturday night there was a lot of violence in in cinderella
84-1_307.16_3.84.wav_ASR	and i remember that that a building was burned
84-1_315.929_2.242.wav_ASR	and so i got
84-1_318.529_2.98.wav_ASR	oh i i live in a fairly secure place
84-1_322.129_4.884.wav_ASR	and the next morning i got up really early and went outside
84-1_327.229_1.08.wav_ASR	it was a total mess
84-1_329.189_1.324.wav_ASR	so i started cleaning up
84-1_331.129_3.4.wav_ASR	and somehow the during the day i felt a little bit she
84-1_334.969_1.819.wav_ASR	so i went back home
84-1_337.0_1.019.wav_ASR	and i rested for a little
84-1_338.309_1.26.wav_ASR	went out and got a paper
84-1_340.069_2.184.wav_ASR	and then i felt pretty good for the rest of the day
84-1_342.769_10.717.wav_ASR	and sometimes on that sunday night between may thirty first and august i mean and june first i had my stroke
84-1_354.11_3.04.wav_ASR	and in the morning my wife could not get a hold of me
84-1_357.75_1.397.wav_ASR	so we have a door man here
84-1_359.39_0.831.wav_ASR	and he went up
84-1_360.85_1.3.wav_ASR	and i was on the floor
84-1_362.37_2.0.wav_ASR	and so he called the ambulance
84-1_364.67_4.58.wav_ASR	my wife was in oxford maryland
84-1_369.477_7.22.wav_ASR	so she was told that i should that
84-1_377.397_1.08.wav_ASR	yeah bad with pronunciation
84-1_378.897_3.68.wav_ASR	that my wife should come home
84-1_382.428_8.24.wav_ASR	and i have two sons one who's in new orleans and one who's in san francisco
84-1_391.348_6.86.wav_ASR	and they were told it was probably good idea for them to come home because i wasn't gonna happen
84-1_398.267_6.5.wav_ASR	and so i remember distinctly that i was brought into the emergency room
84-1_405.227_2.72.wav_ASR	and apparently i i could not say a lot
84-1_407.987_2.86.wav_ASR	my my voice was very hard
84-1_411.47_14.3.wav_ASR	but the end by the end of the procedure she she wasn't sure what kind of shape she'd be
84-1_425.77_14.463.wav_ASR	but by the end of the surgery she thought the surgery thought that i was going to be able to live
84-1_440.31_3.579.wav_ASR	they didn't know how much exactly i'll be able to do
84-1_444.38_6.0.wav_ASR	so i i spent about six eight weeks in rehab
84-1_451.21_2.29.wav_ASR	and i came out not sure what i could
84-1_453.84_4.18.wav_ASR	so today i i feel pretty good about my voice
84-1_458.6_2.9.wav_ASR	as i said i still feel like there's more i can do
84-1_462.06_4.25.wav_ASR	so as i said i think i'm about seventy percent right now
84-1_478.63_9.28.wav_ASR	well i was in the hospital maybe eight blocks from here
84-1_488.29_1.76.wav_ASR	and it was a time when it was cooperative
84-1_490.47_3.04.wav_ASR	so it wasn't really easy for me to see people
84-1_494.13_3.84.wav_ASR	but one of the people were we live
84-1_498.084_2.28.wav_ASR	because i live in a high story building
84-1_501.2_9.29.wav_ASR	one of the persons was maybe the second or third command at firstnamej which is where i went to for my rehab
84-1_511.17_8.41.wav_ASR	and this person whose name is firstnamek was allowed to get two people in to see me at day
84-1_520.09_3.903.wav_ASR	well i i got to see well my two sisters came in
84-1_524.19_2.789.wav_ASR	and my my children came in
84-1_527.21_2.02.wav_ASR	and then my wife came in
84-1_529.33_4.5.wav_ASR	so i had a very good treatment
84-1_534.47_8.45.wav_ASR	and so each day i would have o t p t and speech
84-1_543.73_2.66.wav_ASR	so that was every day except for saturdays and sundays
84-1_554.07_3.15.wav_ASR	well what you know there's nothing i can do about it
84-1_558.98_2.94.wav_ASR	so i i mean i understood i hadta deal with that
84-1_562.65_2.916.wav_ASR	yeah didn't always deal with it but i try to
84-1_590.17_3.99.wav_ASR	well i hafta tell you i've had a pretty good life until my stroke
84-1_595.73_3.421.wav_ASR	and i would say that one of the best things that ever happened to me was
84-1_599.151_7.46.wav_ASR	but i was in a program at a school called wesley which is in middletown kentucky
84-1_607.212_12.7.wav_ASR	and when i was there part of the this program i was in this conference responded made it so that i hadta spend a semester of
84-1_620.93_9.96.wav_ASR	and during starting in seven grade through high school and then into college i spoke french pretty well
84-1_631.61_7.66.wav_ASR	because i had a teacher in in venecia who was at the time going out with one of the cuba baseball players
84-1_639.596_3.36.wav_ASR	and so she was friendly
84-1_643.098_1.783.wav_ASR	and she useta talk about that a lot
84-1_645.456_2.323.wav_ASR	and so i took a class from her
84-1_648.376_1.811.wav_ASR	and somehow i did pretty well
84-1_650.376_6.36.wav_ASR	so when i then i was in the program at at westlake
84-1_657.064_3.6.wav_ASR	and i would say one of the happiest occasions for me was graduation
84-1_661.59_8.094.wav_ASR	well i i i i wound up doing pretty well at the school and even though i had gotten in on a waitlist
84-1_670.684_1.52.wav_ASR	it was really exciting
84-1_672.25_9.12.wav_ASR	and i i i i knew a bunch of people in my class but i was really close with the class of eighty
84-1_681.67_2.875.wav_ASR	and it was just a fun time for me
84-1_684.545_1.765.wav_ASR	but i was present in my funeral
84-1_687.01_6.06.wav_ASR	and i i i met someone who became one of my closest friends
84-1_693.27_2.1.wav_ASR	he was the proof at westland
84-1_695.55_2.306.wav_ASR	so i i it was really nice
84-1_698.38_8.68.wav_ASR	after i graduated from high school college i spent some vacation with him and some of my roommates
84-1_707.68_2.16.wav_ASR	he he was someone who was remote
84-1_710.58_2.476.wav_ASR	he went to hard labor
84-1_713.273_5.48.wav_ASR	and at the end of his freshman year he went to the moot court
84-1_719.733_2.72.wav_ASR	and he went down to the books store
84-1_722.973_3.56.wav_ASR	and he bought all books about italian restaurants
84-1_726.863_7.22.wav_ASR	so he went back to campus and he changed
84-1_734.443_1.76.wav_ASR	he he was already in los angeles
84-1_736.563_2.08.wav_ASR	he'd been under graduate at prince
84-1_739.263_4.24.wav_ASR	and he and he after his first year of running the book he said
84-1_743.663_0.992.wav_ASR	it wasn't for me
84-1_744.8_5.82.wav_ASR	and he went to at harbor he went to a a program in atlanticus
84-1_756.57_3.48.wav_ASR	yeah i i was really it was a good place for me
84-1_764.754_4.32.wav_ASR	but i haven't been visiting since my stroke
84-1_769.655_5.279.wav_ASR	but i useta be fairly involved in it at the university
84-1_775.834_6.1.wav_ASR	and my youngest son went there after spending a year and a half
84-1_782.807_7.94.wav_ASR	and he did really well at the school
84-1_790.907_3.04.wav_ASR	so i was very excited for him
84-1_828.61_2.67.wav_ASR	well i happened to know the pictures quite awhile
84-1_832.07_3.18.wav_ASR	it's a story about a kid playing soccer
84-1_836.05_3.3.wav_ASR	and he he he strikes the ball
84-1_839.99_3.52.wav_ASR	and went through the window of a nearby house
84-1_843.796_24.848.wav_ASR	and landed inside the house where it was taken by one of the young or middle age husband or just a regular person who lived in the house
84-1_868.644_20.254.wav_ASR	and then he looked out the window to see if he could figure out who may have hit hit the soccer ball so that it landed on his lap close to his lap
84-1_907.89_1.94.wav_ASR	but this one i don't know
84-1_909.988_8.342.wav_ASR	it's about a young boy who went to school he was deciding whether or not to take an umbrella
84-1_918.59_2.6.wav_ASR	he decided not to take the umbrella
84-1_921.69_2.48.wav_ASR	and it turned out that it it started raining
84-1_924.87_1.88.wav_ASR	so he went back home
84-1_926.94_1.818.wav_ASR	and he was soaking wet
84-1_929.34_2.127.wav_ASR	but i apparently he changed his clothes
84-1_932.02_5.76.wav_ASR	and he went back outside with a umbrella so that he could get to school
84-1_938.24_6.041.wav_ASR	assume he went to school on time but i really don't know whether that's part of the story or not
84-1_957.58_7.15.wav_ASR	so this is a little girl maybe under ten who had a cat who was stuck up in the tree
84-1_965.45_7.58.wav_ASR	so apparently the the dad got off his ladder
84-1_973.283_3.967.wav_ASR	the girl was on a tricycle
84-1_977.59_1.904.wav_ASR	he stopped and looked at the cat
84-1_979.94_19.956.wav_ASR	so the the the the the the the father went up to get the cat
84-1_999.896_13.754.wav_ASR	and i guess the the ladder got kicked away so that the the husband was stuck up there with the cat
84-1_1014.556_2.6.wav_ASR	and the the dog started barking
84-1_1017.78_2.68.wav_ASR	and eventually the fire department came
84-1_1021.24_0.94.wav_ASR	they were able
84-1_1022.44_0.5.wav_ASR	presume
84-1_1023.32_0.654.wav_ASR	they don't know
84-1_1024.06_3.563.wav_ASR	but i think they were able to get the man down
84-1_1188.54_7.06.wav_ASR	so this is a story about a a young woman named cinderella
84-1_1196.189_19.982.wav_ASR	and she was working at a place where there was a a middle age lady and two people who had grown up with her and was interested in trying to get someone to marry them
84-1_1216.59_15.38.wav_ASR	so it turned out that there was a young prince who was interested who was living with her with his family
84-1_1232.85_29.52.wav_ASR	and the young prince decided that they should get together and have a ball so that maybe the people from the community could find out if anybody if if if the people of the community the girls were possibly interested in in having a relationship with the prince
84-1_1263.48_2.52.wav_ASR	but i don't remember the name of the prince
84-1_1266.09_4.89.wav_ASR	but so they send her around a invitation to all the people in the community
84-1_1272.04_9.98.wav_ASR	and the two young ladies who lived with her who lived with her
84-1_1284.38_8.84.wav_ASR	her older mother decided that they would go to the ball and started getting dressed to go to the ball
84-1_1293.98_17.52.wav_ASR	but cinderella who was a carriage on the property and was stuck doing things like washing clothes and cleaning the floor and stuff like that she found out about their being this
84-1_1312.413_4.54.wav_ASR	and she wanted to know if there was some way she could attend
84-1_1317.593_1.78.wav_ASR	so she
84-1_1320.333_2.28.wav_ASR	they don't remember exactly how it happened
84-1_1323.133_6.02.wav_ASR	but she was able to get in touch with somebody i think they call the fairy
84-1_1330.065_3.52.wav_ASR	and she talked to the fairy godmother
84-1_1334.45_20.985.wav_ASR	and so while the two people from the house were going with her her her older lady to the dance she decided that she could go
84-1_1355.435_4.2.wav_ASR	so she got dressed up in fancy clothes
84-1_1360.415_5.337.wav_ASR	and she was told by the fairy godmother that she could go to the ball
84-1_1365.795_1.72.wav_ASR	but she had only one record
84-1_1368.295_2.94.wav_ASR	and that is that she be be back by midnight
84-1_1371.407_11.811.wav_ASR	so she went to the ball and fell in love with the prince and was having a good time with the prince
84-1_1383.218_12.28.wav_ASR	but when the clock struck strike midnight cinderella knew that she hadta get out of there
84-1_1396.098_5.08.wav_ASR	so she raced for the door and down the steps and into the carriage
84-1_1401.35_2.26.wav_ASR	but soon the carriage
84-1_1404.69_9.9.wav_ASR	and she was by herself with i think some young people who may have been rabbits and other members of the community
84-1_1415.23_19.09.wav_ASR	so she she found out that the the young prince was looking for the the the young lady who had disappeared disappeared at midnight
84-1_1434.84_11.51.wav_ASR	and he sent out a i guess some sort of plea or something that if the person was around she should please contact him
84-1_1446.76_12.16.wav_ASR	and when that didn't happen then a young man went around the village to see if by chance anybody knew anything about this young girl
84-1_1459.92_3.1.wav_ASR	and when she went to the house that had the two
84-1_1463.595_2.1.wav_ASR	again i guess you might by now call him speak
84-1_1468.04_9.89.wav_ASR	but she i think somehow got a hold of cinderella who maybe washing clothes in the basement or something
84-1_1478.88_7.897.wav_ASR	and when she was brought upstairs the one shoe that had been left behind she tried on that one shoe
84-1_1486.777_13.623.wav_ASR	and it fit her so that she knew that the the young prince was going to continue to like this young lady
84-1_1501.077_2.06.wav_ASR	and so i guess they got back together
84-1_1503.537_1.94.wav_ASR	and eventually they got married
84-1_1550.75_3.76.wav_ASR	never really had a lot of experiences with clocks
84-1_1555.47_3.2.wav_ASR	my i was pretty much always on time
84-1_1559.37_10.68.wav_ASR	and when i was growing up particularly when i was in high school there for some reason was no real time limit on what time i hadta get home
84-1_1570.61_8.74.wav_ASR	so you know i went to a lot of parties on friday night and saturday night and come home when i wanted
84-1_1579.38_20.6.wav_ASR	but i think it was in large part because my two social workers decided that you know he that the two of them really hadta teach me how to be how to be comfortable with myself and then to be able to be comfortable with myself and then to be able to be comfortable with myself and then to be able to be comfortable with myself
84-1_1600.084_3.495.wav_ASR	so i mean there were a few times when i was out too late
84-1_1604.124_2.309.wav_ASR	but nothing really ever happened to me
84-1_1606.924_3.866.wav_ASR	and then when i went to college i would come home during the summer
84-1_1611.804_6.56.wav_ASR	and i remember that i was involved with the couple young ladies
84-1_1618.528_4.623.wav_ASR	but i would go out with them but i could get home whenever i wanted to
84-1_1623.52_6.58.wav_ASR	and i remember one summer i had a job that required me to be at work at six o'clock in the morning
84-1_1630.928_3.42.wav_ASR	so sometimes during the summer i would stay at all night and then go to work
84-1_1645.61_7.485.wav_ASR	well so i worked a lot particularly when i had i was i turned out to be
84-1_1653.47_2.186.wav_ASR	think i may have told you this
84-1_1655.73_0.463.wav_ASR	and i sure
84-1_1656.193_3.42.wav_ASR	but i worked for a friend's company for
84-1_1660.878_8.049.wav_ASR	and i when i had my stroke i started thinking about things i could do
84-1_1668.927_8.2.wav_ASR	because really between vacation and between a lot of time i spent particularly with my children
84-1_1678.067_2.92.wav_ASR	they were in a town in new jersey called prince
84-1_1681.727_2.08.wav_ASR	and they both played a lot of hockey
84-1_1684.367_2.89.wav_ASR	so i never really had a lot of time
84-1_1687.246_2.783.wav_ASR	but one thing i've decided i'm going to do
84-1_1690.506_4.76.wav_ASR	within the past within the next year we're gonna be moving a little further south
84-1_1695.886_3.08.wav_ASR	and i really thought that one thing i could do was bird
84-1_1699.586_2.933.wav_ASR	because i've always had an interest in that
84-1_1702.606_1.984.wav_ASR	but i've never really focused on that
84-1_1705.086_1.62.wav_ASR	and i really thought particularly
84-1_1706.856_2.9.wav_ASR	now i write a three real nice
84-1_1709.936_4.506.wav_ASR	two a two wheel bicycle like i useta do
84-1_1714.521_16.081.wav_ASR	so i'm really hoping that we move i can learn about birds and maybe become someone of an interest in in in bird watching because i think that would be a good thing for me to do
84-1_1736.76_2.52.wav_ASR	oh so did she live in bloomington
84-1_1760.0_20.64.wav_ASR	well i i guess when i started traveling for this friend company when i started the program when i was mainly responsive for the entire night's stages canada and mexico
84-1_1780.938_3.5.wav_ASR	but they quickly figured out that i could speak
84-1_1785.098_1.94.wav_ASR	so the lawyers were in front
84-1_1787.898_2.948.wav_ASR	and i was one of the few boys outside of france
84-1_1791.078_1.06.wav_ASR	it was in the united states
84-1_1793.658_4.48.wav_ASR	oh they useta send me to various places
84-1_1798.398_5.96.wav_ASR	and i remember that i stayed in a real nice hotel in
84-1_1805.978_2.42.wav_ASR	and i also stayed in the nice hotel
84-1_1809.158_3.84.wav_ASR	and i was in a nice hotel when i went to china
84-1_1813.177_5.8.wav_ASR	and i also was in a nice hotel when i was in
84-1_1822.457_6.54.wav_ASR	so i i and during one of the times i was there and it was the fourth of the
84-1_1829.537_3.16.wav_ASR	so i remember that the staff brought me a little cake
84-1_1833.15_7.12.wav_ASR	so i i i i i i don't really need a big hotel or my wife likes something
84-1_1841.05_10.3.wav_ASR	oh i i always thought i was in places that i could be comfortable even when even when
84-1_1851.626_2.28.wav_ASR	even i i do remember saying at one place
84-1_1854.01_5.896.wav_ASR	oh i was in bermuda alabama for for to to be part of a case that was pending
84-1_1860.446_2.235.wav_ASR	and we stayed in a god awful hotel
84-1_1862.726_3.066.wav_ASR	even even that turned out to be good for me
84-1_1865.941_11.7.wav_ASR	so it was a good way for me to learn about the way different hotels can treat me different
84-1_1878.421_3.38.wav_ASR	oh i i was in a hotel in a bad part of town
84-1_1882.0_1.381.wav_ASR	remember that pretty well
84-1_1897.088_7.408.wav_ASR	well when i was in college there was the prince
84-1_1904.816_0.654.wav_ASR	and i told you
84-1_1905.47_0.58.wav_ASR	the pumpkin
84-1_1906.59_6.9.wav_ASR	and over the he was there for about about thirty thirty five years
84-1_1913.91_2.92.wav_ASR	and in nineteen ninety nine he died
84-1_1917.85_5.54.wav_ASR	but before that time he and a group of people
84-1_1923.607_16.1.wav_ASR	there was one person from the class of sixty five one person from the class of eighty
84-1_1939.914_5.6.wav_ASR	the six five of us became very good friends
84-1_1945.874_9.776.wav_ASR	and every year because firstnamew did not really have any friend
84-1_1955.75_8.1.wav_ASR	he had a child who died when when he was i think maybe six or seven years old
84-1_1964.11_8.96.wav_ASR	and and so one thing he useta do is he useta go down to new york
84-1_1973.501_5.94.wav_ASR	and we we we would i went from my graduation
84-1_1979.861_3.68.wav_ASR	and i went for every year there after for about twenty five years
84-1_1983.921_5.12.wav_ASR	and i went to a place that's no longer in existence but it's called the
84-1_1989.678_3.6.wav_ASR	and it was a very nice place
84-1_1994.718_3.712.wav_ASR	and we just had a wonderful time every year i was there
84-1_1998.43_14.51.wav_ASR	so i really think back on that a lot and remember just how much fun i had with these people and how much fun i still keep in contact with them
84-1_2012.94_5.74.wav_ASR	and so these these people are some very well known people
84-1_2019.2_6.8.wav_ASR	and so i already had one of the wives has already died
84-1_2026.88_4.22.wav_ASR	he was the head of this thing called the the
84-1_2031.651_17.0.wav_ASR	it's a big it's they work for a family
84-1_2048.851_0.828.wav_ASR	and i forgot the name
84-1_2049.811_1.4.wav_ASR	they have a huge truck
84-1_2051.568_3.28.wav_ASR	and so he's gonna retire and move back to new york
84-1_2055.648_10.086.wav_ASR	so i'm very excited that at the end of september i'm gonna be meeting with them and and these people who go back to the class in sixty two
84-1_2066.128_2.086.wav_ASR	so i'm i'm looking forward to it
84-1_2068.397_8.98.wav_ASR	today i i some days i kinda wish i would be in a little better strength than i am now
84-1_2077.677_3.26.wav_ASR	they all know i had a stroke
84-1_2081.677_3.36.wav_ASR	but i i'm really looking forward
84-1_2085.17_5.06.wav_ASR	mostly days some days i think that maybe i should not go because i'm not far enough along
84-1_2090.73_1.56.wav_ASR	but it's
84-1_2093.19_1.8.wav_ASR	can't even remember what we were talking about
84-1_2100.86_4.44.wav_ASR	so so we went to this very nice restaurant
84-1_2105.464_2.296.wav_ASR	we did it for about twenty or twenty five years
84-1_2108.22_5.907.wav_ASR	and it was a good place for me and for the other people that were in the group
84-1_2114.08_11.39.wav_ASR	we useta do it every year in december because it was near the time when one of our favorite people from the class of sixty two had a birthday
84-1_2132.16_4.04.wav_ASR	it was a French restaurant called
84-1_2137.66_14.62.wav_ASR	it's if if you go back to the nineteen seventies and eighties and look up the restaurant it's a two fifty nine east street
84-1_2152.28_7.02.wav_ASR	you know it's in a nice old building that has three or four floors
84-1_2159.56_1.7.wav_ASR	it was exciting
84-1_2161.495_22.32.wav_ASR	and because willy would go there on three or four times throughout the year he knew the staff really really well so that when we came in for the birthday party it was just fantastic
84-1_2184.085_1.14.wav_ASR	it was really nice
84-1_2189.53_1.988.wav_ASR	it's not there anymore yeah
84-1_2191.525_0.84.wav_ASR	it was so
84-1_2192.725_1.984.wav_ASR	there was an an owner and his wife
84-1_2195.385_3.86.wav_ASR	and i think they eventually you know was
84-1_2199.985_8.94.wav_ASR	and they saw the restaurant to a guy who was i think from either race or from germany
84-1_2210.365_2.624.wav_ASR	and he did not do a very good job
84-1_2212.939_7.3.wav_ASR	so it i would say after three or four years it it it it it didn't exercise anymore
84-1_2224.89_2.489.wav_ASR	so we're we're going to
84-1_2228.519_2.26.wav_ASR	so the fellow he was
84-1_2231.118_5.52.wav_ASR	oh i could wish i could remember the name of the place that he was involved in m r
84-1_2237.538_4.0.wav_ASR	but he he has one son who's got three wonderful children
84-1_2242.058_2.84.wav_ASR	and they live in in north carolina
84-1_2245.216_14.64.wav_ASR	so my my friend who's now widowed is has has fixed up a place i think in the fifty or sixties in new york
84-1_2260.677_6.594.wav_ASR	so i know that's where the party's gonna be because the apartment is apparently finished now
84-1_2267.297_1.81.wav_ASR	he's been working on it for a couple years
84-1_2290.78_3.59.wav_ASR	oh interesting enough i had one for lunch
84-1_2296.1_4.56.wav_ASR	yeah i like it once in awhile
84-1_2300.734_16.34.wav_ASR	one of the people who was part of the group from luxford is a fellow from the class of sixty five or sixty six
84-1_2317.101_4.2.wav_ASR	and he has a peanut butter and jelly sandwich every day for lunch
84-1_2321.761_2.78.wav_ASR	well what you do is you take two pieces of bread
84-1_2325.321_9.159.wav_ASR	my bread i have my bread in the freezer because i only use a certain amount of it every day
84-1_2335.061_1.789.wav_ASR	so i take the pieces of bread out
84-1_2336.89_7.96.wav_ASR	but i i i they become to room temperature
84-1_2347.07_2.92.wav_ASR	then i have a special peanut butter that i use
84-1_2350.01_1.08.wav_ASR	they've been to the castle
84-1_2353.6_1.85.wav_ASR	well the peanut butter there is natural
84-1_2356.05_2.9.wav_ASR	so that's the peanut butter i buy
84-1_2359.35_3.68.wav_ASR	and i would we have a few hours of that around
84-1_2363.63_3.48.wav_ASR	so i would open the jar take some peanut butter
84-1_2367.83_2.504.wav_ASR	and then i would take different kinds of jelly
84-1_2370.434_9.058.wav_ASR	but right now i'm on a kick where i have it's like flood of blueberry strawberry and raspberry together in a mix
84-1_2380.014_1.86.wav_ASR	and i put that on the sandwich
84-1_2382.514_2.34.wav_ASR	then i close the sandwich
84-1_2385.454_3.553.wav_ASR	and you can either cut it in half or leave it whole
84-1_2389.007_2.9.wav_ASR	and for some stupid reason i always leave it whole
84-1_2392.387_1.62.wav_ASR	and i had what was a nice sandwich
84-1_2394.347_5.34.wav_ASR	so i had that about one thirty as i was preparing for my two o'clock call
84-1_2413.71_5.31.wav_ASR	well wonder is something i still try to do but i think my wife probably does more of it
84-1_2420.092_4.906.wav_ASR	oh i would choose what kind of temperature i would want it
84-1_2424.998_6.36.wav_ASR	but technically i would use cold water because most of the stuff i needta watch is cold water
84-1_2431.958_3.042.wav_ASR	so i would in the special we have a machine
84-1_2435.278_2.14.wav_ASR	we live in the in the park
84-1_2437.656_7.8.wav_ASR	we live in an area that useta be that was where we hafta buy the condo
84-1_2446.076_9.42.wav_ASR	but because we're getting ready to move next year we saw our condominium and we moved into a rental unit in the same building
84-1_2455.617_4.36.wav_ASR	so we would get the water back
84-1_2461.32_13.017.wav_ASR	once the water's set it's a machine that it it it it comes out on the side
84-1_2474.39_1.33.wav_ASR	so there's nothing on the top
84-1_2476.55_1.89.wav_ASR	so we hafta lose the watch
84-1_2479.39_8.06.wav_ASR	and then we put the the laundry detergent in it and start it
84-1_2487.48_6.74.wav_ASR	and you can see it from the window
84-1_2495.135_8.325.wav_ASR	it's not something that's it's something that is easily to see from the floor
84-1_2504.52_2.52.wav_ASR	and so we put it on white
84-1_2507.302_4.58.wav_ASR	and it usually last for some reason for a hour and five minutes
84-1_2512.062_3.808.wav_ASR	but after an hour and five minutes the wash is done
84-1_2515.962_6.0.wav_ASR	if we have particular clothes that need to be put on the line we would typically put it on the line
84-1_2522.162_4.18.wav_ASR	and the rest of it would go into the dryer where it would dry
84-1_2526.352_8.24.wav_ASR	and then it would be ready to be folded and put in the couple of drawers that we use for for laundry
84-1_2535.332_2.932.wav_ASR	my wife has quite a few more than i do
84-1_2538.264_8.158.wav_ASR	but it's a place where we can put our stuff and use it as we need it
84-1_2557.42_3.87.wav_ASR	well you hafta understand that now i have it takes me a while
84-1_2562.42_5.82.wav_ASR	so i usually get up in the morning
84-1_2568.47_8.6.wav_ASR	and i will put on my underwear
84-1_2578.86_3.09.wav_ASR	and then i would put on my shirt
84-1_2583.37_2.06.wav_ASR	and i would put on my socks
84-1_2586.38_6.68.wav_ASR	and then i would lie in bed for a little bit and do some exercises because exercise is very important to me
84-1_2593.52_9.62.wav_ASR	especially even though i'm normally more than three years old it's still important for me to to get some exercise in every day
84-1_2603.74_0.96.wav_ASR	so i do that
84-1_2604.776_5.64.wav_ASR	and then i will typically turn on the tv
84-1_2610.876_6.2.wav_ASR	and i'll get dressed the rest of my way which includes you know my son
84-1_2617.536_4.7.wav_ASR	you haven't seen this but i wear a brace on my right foot
84-1_2622.416_1.873.wav_ASR	so i put that on as well
84-1_2624.77_4.28.wav_ASR	and i i start my day
84-2_12.09_1.1.wav_ASR	my favorite holiday
84-2_13.79_9.28.wav_ASR	it's easily thank giving because i have a very small family but usually the family comes as well as my two sons
84-2_24.03_1.468.wav_ASR	and now one of them's married
84-2_25.77_2.32.wav_ASR	what the and the others are gonna be married pretty soon
84-2_28.25_4.26.wav_ASR	so i look forward to a table with a few more people
84-2_32.564_2.32.wav_ASR	oh i have two sisters
84-2_35.624_2.44.wav_ASR	one of them who lives i think i told you in new york
84-2_38.244_1.46.wav_ASR	one of them who lives in chicago
84-2_40.424_2.76.wav_ASR	so they typically come
84-2_43.573_14.028.wav_ASR	and for many many years i have until i had my stroke i was in charge of the cooking of the turkey which i do on a grill
84-2_58.053_1.58.wav_ASR	so it's really really nice
84-2_60.413_2.52.wav_ASR	now i don't do it on the girl anymore
84-2_63.47_4.5.wav_ASR	and we useta have a place at the shore but we don't have that anymore
84-2_68.71_4.28.wav_ASR	so i i somebody else cooks it in the oven
84-2_78.94_7.65.wav_ASR	well i've been the host for thanksgiving since my mother died in nineteen ninety
84-2_86.96_1.04.wav_ASR	so it's been awhile
84-2_92.66_0.372.wav_ASR	it is
84-2_93.22_2.6.wav_ASR	it's nice but it doesn't last for very long
84-2_100.512_2.1.wav_ASR	we celebrate holidays
84-2_103.112_6.44.wav_ASR	and so we we typically we don't even give presents anymore
84-2_109.668_11.36.wav_ASR	unfortunately both of the young ladies that my two sons married are both not june
84-2_121.788_3.708.wav_ASR	one of them i think has no relation to me
84-2_125.777_3.18.wav_ASR	and one of them i think it's basically
84-2_130.297_4.6.wav_ASR	but i think she likes cinderella as well
84-2_154.92_3.84.wav_ASR	my speech is probably the thing that i'm working on the most
84-2_159.16_7.84.wav_ASR	as you know i useta be a lawyer and i've just i've just gone back on active duty
84-2_167.46_3.07.wav_ASR	so i can still be a lawyer if i wanna be a lawyer
84-2_171.22_15.68.wav_ASR	but i i feel that a lot of times especially with small words and pronunciation and with his and her and left and right i'm still a little i'm not great with them
84-2_187.36_3.34.wav_ASR	so that that i hafta think for awhile
84-2_190.722_2.64.wav_ASR	especially now that lorda does multiple
84-2_193.622_1.4.wav_ASR	or that's all the driving
84-2_195.302_2.954.wav_ASR	and i hafta remember which is left and which is right
84-2_198.782_1.54.wav_ASR	that confuses me sometimes
84-2_200.742_3.33.wav_ASR	and i'm i'm pretty good about back and forth
84-2_204.582_2.796.wav_ASR	and i'm hoping that i'll be able to drive at some point
84-2_207.378_8.784.wav_ASR	but not that i really want it drive because i've never been particularly interested in driving
84-2_216.44_9.7.wav_ASR	just do it because my wife fits in the other seat and my two kids when they were around sometimes they would drive but sometimes they would also sit in the back
84-2_227.22_6.2.wav_ASR	but but now since my stroke my wife does all the driving
84-2_234.05_6.33.wav_ASR	and as i say i think maybe in a year or so i may be able to start driving again
84-2_240.74_0.76.wav_ASR	hmhm i'm i'm not sure
84-2_247.16_2.58.wav_ASR	don't tell my wife that but yes it's true
84-2_257.54_0.74.wav_ASR	yeah yeah
84-2_263.0_2.98.wav_ASR	oh yeah i i remember my stroke pretty well
84-2_273.18_11.211.wav_ASR	well i was in the hospital for about eight days before i went to the rehab program which is also connected to tampon's journal
84-2_285.39_20.682.wav_ASR	and that's where in my area of town which is nearby ten blocks from here we go down instead of going up to pen which is probably around about the same
84-2_306.65_15.44.wav_ASR	and i remember you know i think i told you that on sunday morning i went out to get and i went out because there was a riot the night before from the guy up in michigan
84-2_322.53_1.5.wav_ASR	he forget his name right now
84-2_324.03_2.88.wav_ASR	so there's a huge ride
84-2_327.03_2.723.wav_ASR	we had a building actually burned here
84-2_330.29_4.617.wav_ASR	and i went out at about six o'clock in the morning to start cleaning up
84-2_335.07_2.209.wav_ASR	and i was one of the few people out there
84-2_337.63_2.1.wav_ASR	and i remember them being a ton of clean up
84-2_339.843_5.105.wav_ASR	and so i was there for about six to nine o'clock in the morning
84-2_345.103_1.957.wav_ASR	and then i went to get a new place
84-2_347.387_0.994.wav_ASR	didn't feel great
84-2_348.683_2.769.wav_ASR	so i write write lay down for a little bit
84-2_351.763_2.48.wav_ASR	and then i went to work in the afternoon
84-2_354.303_6.287.wav_ASR	and by the evening i was starting to feel a little worse but not terribly worse
84-2_361.05_2.15.wav_ASR	and i went to bed around ten thirty
84-2_364.003_2.577.wav_ASR	and i had my stroke in the middle of the night
84-2_367.183_3.063.wav_ASR	and in the morning my wife could not get a hold of me
84-2_370.723_2.645.wav_ASR	so we have a conference who came up and found me
84-2_373.648_1.7.wav_ASR	and they took me to the hospital
84-2_375.668_2.58.wav_ASR	that's when i spent about eight days in the hospital
84-2_378.928_4.34.wav_ASR	because because i was driving coach
84-2_383.468_2.537.wav_ASR	so i really didn't see anybody there
84-2_386.828_5.56.wav_ASR	and i had it was difficult for me because i feel felt my talking was not great
84-2_392.4_3.057.wav_ASR	and i also it was just difficult for me
84-2_395.58_4.82.wav_ASR	so it was i mean i must have watched tv
84-2_400.74_2.02.wav_ASR	and i i was in a room by myself
84-2_402.991_12.52.wav_ASR	and eventually on a monday night about a week and a couple days later i went to michigan which only about six blocks away
84-2_415.551_0.838.wav_ASR	it was pretty close
84-2_416.971_3.157.wav_ASR	so that's when i stayed for two months
84-2_430.74_2.047.wav_ASR	oh i've done a lot of things to try to get better
84-2_433.0_1.662.wav_ASR	but i don't know if all that works but
84-2_435.24_3.841.wav_ASR	so i was in the hospital for four eight weeks
84-2_439.239_9.64.wav_ASR	and every day except the weekends i had o t and p t
84-2_449.599_1.36.wav_ASR	and then i also had speech
84-2_451.039_1.499.wav_ASR	that was typically in the morning
84-2_453.139_4.394.wav_ASR	and then in the afternoon i for a while i didn't do anything
84-2_457.533_3.458.wav_ASR	but then eventually i started going to art
84-2_461.433_4.9.wav_ASR	and i i i did some stuff but it wasn't really very good
84-2_467.093_6.865.wav_ASR	and i thought by the time i left there i wasn't so sure i was gonna do it
84-2_474.15_7.18.wav_ASR	so i tried it a little bit more at mgk which where i go for outpatient
84-2_481.83_0.958.wav_ASR	and it wasn't great
84-2_483.11_2.78.wav_ASR	soon they introduced a music program
84-2_486.65_2.184.wav_ASR	and i was always interested in singing
84-2_489.35_2.38.wav_ASR	but i don't sing a lot
84-2_491.79_3.961.wav_ASR	and i'm afraid i don't always sing on key
84-2_496.23_1.816.wav_ASR	oh i thought it might be good
84-2_498.25_2.78.wav_ASR	so i took some singing lessons which i still take
84-2_501.63_4.7.wav_ASR	and then awesome at temple there's an aphasia program
84-2_506.586_10.4.wav_ASR	and so there's a singing program there which i think better because i get real songs and instead of made up songs at meg
84-2_517.118_19.5.wav_ASR	and i also on on on something called on on on aphasia and see see how we can help other people learn about aphasia and see see how we can help other people who have aphasia
84-2_563.78_6.71.wav_ASR	well i have a lot of good experiences because i've had a pretty positive life
84-2_570.49_11.14.wav_ASR	and i spent up until first grade i went to school in a suburb of cleburne of cleburne
84-2_582.166_13.72.wav_ASR	and then between my first and second grade years i moved to chicago and was in a really nice suburb there called waltham
84-2_596.144_6.909.wav_ASR	and so growing up i i i was participating in a lot of different things
84-2_603.184_3.92.wav_ASR	but i was not a great athlete but i was an okay enough athlete
84-2_607.264_4.74.wav_ASR	so i usually make the last play on the second last play there on the team
84-2_612.29_4.45.wav_ASR	and i really like playing hockey which we did outdoors at the time
84-2_617.81_12.14.wav_ASR	and so i learned a lot of experiences from hockey just just about about the game and about how to set up different plays
84-2_630.86_17.583.wav_ASR	and eventually eventually when i was in my what's called the banco leg which is fourteen and fifteen i was made captain of the team
84-2_648.56_1.971.wav_ASR	so that was a really nice outcome for me
84-2_650.531_4.636.wav_ASR	and i was and it was a good time for me
84-2_655.371_2.836.wav_ASR	my i was on the b t i was not on the a t
84-2_658.411_5.549.wav_ASR	but but there's enough players on the beam team that i were pretty friendly with
84-2_664.191_1.68.wav_ASR	and all of them were gone
84-2_666.031_2.66.wav_ASR	so it was
84-2_668.951_1.04.wav_ASR	and they're near the river
84-2_670.145_2.671.wav_ASR	so it was really nice to meet all the people
84-2_673.365_10.54.wav_ASR	and we would have games basically from lake forest and from lake county
84-2_684.865_2.36.wav_ASR	so it was just nice to get to know some people
84-2_693.81_2.2.wav_ASR	and i did get her by my hand
84-2_696.361_5.44.wav_ASR	my i broke my college
84-2_706.07_1.072.wav_ASR	it wasn't that bad
84-2_710.85_1.037.wav_ASR	it it can be
84-2_712.13_2.397.wav_ASR	but it wasn't bad for me
84-2_714.67_2.22.wav_ASR	maybe it wasn't a particularly bad
84-2_717.63_4.6.wav_ASR	but i remember i came home and i still wasn't feeling great
84-2_722.231_11.86.wav_ASR	so my dad took me to what was then called evanston hospital which is now part of northwestern medical center from downtown
84-2_735.0_4.82.wav_ASR	and so i remember i did some exercises and some other things
84-2_740.071_1.66.wav_ASR	and they said i had a broken collar
84-2_741.98_7.66.wav_ASR	so i i think you know i i actually broke my collarbone
84-2_751.48_1.24.wav_ASR	maybe it was only once
84-2_753.1_1.699.wav_ASR	and then i also broke my wrist
84-2_755.56_1.969.wav_ASR	but i can't remember exactly how he did that
84-2_765.892_4.149.wav_ASR	yeah yeah you you can't have a cat on that
84-2_776.028_1.013.wav_ASR	me
84-2_777.152_1.08.wav_ASR	you play sports
84-2_781.243_1.08.wav_ASR	oh well
84-2_785.063_2.76.wav_ASR	so did you do that in college too
84-2_797.763_0.72.wav_ASR	oh good
84-2_845.89_2.26.wav_ASR	oh yes that's the same thing we saw
84-2_858.01_2.94.wav_ASR	so it's the story of a young man
84-2_861.0_5.48.wav_ASR	he's around twelve years old kicking a soccer ball
84-2_867.26_13.14.wav_ASR	and i guess one of the air engine kits went through a plate glass window and landed next to someone who was probably either reading or maybe watching tv
84-2_880.69_3.33.wav_ASR	and so he saw the ball coming at him
84-2_884.43_10.34.wav_ASR	and he notices that a lamp had come a lamp had come to rest beside him
84-2_895.09_3.248.wav_ASR	and i could see the ball coming at him
84-2_898.338_2.865.wav_ASR	so he might have caught the ball
84-2_902.03_2.001.wav_ASR	and he wasn't sure what to do
84-2_904.138_2.02.wav_ASR	so he saw that the glass was broken
84-2_906.678_4.26.wav_ASR	so he went over to the window to see what had happened
84-2_911.418_4.592.wav_ASR	and i assuming that he saw the person who kicked the soccer ball
84-2_916.01_6.4.wav_ASR	but the then perhaps but by then perhaps the person with the soccer ball had run away
84-2_930.177_7.24.wav_ASR	so it's the story of a young boy who was on his way to school
84-2_938.237_5.22.wav_ASR	and he wasn't sure that he needed an umbrella
84-2_943.61_7.119.wav_ASR	so he decided that he wouldn't take an umbrella because it maybe didn't look like it was gonna rain
84-2_951.25_5.94.wav_ASR	but as soon as she stepped outside and started walking a little bit the rain came down
84-2_957.89_1.84.wav_ASR	so he went back to his house
84-2_959.73_4.444.wav_ASR	and i he was all wet
84-2_964.39_3.26.wav_ASR	and his mother had a strong look on her face
84-2_967.95_1.755.wav_ASR	but there was nothing he could do
84-2_969.89_4.927.wav_ASR	so he got some new clothes and went back out into the rain
84-2_975.35_1.92.wav_ASR	but this time he had an umbrella
84-2_988.79_6.25.wav_ASR	one this is the picture of a young lady who had a cat stuck up in a tree
84-2_995.279_8.66.wav_ASR	so he she got off his tricycle and saw i think what must have been his dad
84-2_1004.61_2.312.wav_ASR	his dad climbed up the tree
84-2_1007.139_3.56.wav_ASR	but then the ladder broke and fell to the ground
84-2_1011.04_7.14.wav_ASR	there's a a puppy who's trying to see if maybe the man or could come down
84-2_1018.34_18.709.wav_ASR	but he was up there and needed to be rescued by the fire department who came over and to get the father down and perhaps i imagine also get the cat down
84-2_1188.82_0.522.wav_ASR	yeah
84-2_1190.29_11.04.wav_ASR	well so this is a story about cinderella and her two i think they were probably stepdaughters and her old
84-2_1202.87_5.93.wav_ASR	so i believe that cinderella needed some help
84-2_1208.85_10.08.wav_ASR	and since she was able to get a job with the two stepsisters and the stepmother
84-2_1219.6_12.86.wav_ASR	and she was doing a lot of stuff washing the clothes and cleaning the cleaning cleaning the floors and doing stuff like that and probably also doing the laundry
84-2_1233.61_13.66.wav_ASR	then it came to pass that there was a prince who lived in the castle with his father and mother and perhaps some sisters and brothers
84-2_1247.87_7.51.wav_ASR	and he he was looking for somebody to fall in love with
84-2_1255.91_10.09.wav_ASR	so everybody in the town got an invitation to this big party that they were gonna have
84-2_1266.0_7.976.wav_ASR	so the two stepsisters dress up in fine clothes and the mother went with them
84-2_1273.976_12.38.wav_ASR	and they were the the prince the king was looking for
84-2_1286.996_3.0.wav_ASR	and so he he decided to have this party
84-2_1290.119_5.02.wav_ASR	and so they were at the party
84-2_1295.299_12.78.wav_ASR	and then a fairy godmother came along and said to the young woman cinderella should go to the party too
84-2_1308.226_9.88.wav_ASR	so she she was able to get a dress and some nice clothing including a some beautiful shoes
84-2_1319.006_8.0.wav_ASR	and they were they they were in some how invited to the wedding
84-2_1327.231_10.9.wav_ASR	and they came to the wedding and a special ceremony which had a rider and i think of someone who was in the back
84-2_1338.211_7.36.wav_ASR	and they came out at the party
84-2_1345.673_6.279.wav_ASR	and the the the prince was there
84-2_1352.133_2.54.wav_ASR	and the prince saw cinderella
84-2_1355.293_3.02.wav_ASR	and they had a very good time
84-2_1358.335_10.88.wav_ASR	but the prince had the the the cinderella had been told that she needed to be home by midnight
84-2_1370.035_5.014.wav_ASR	so as the clock struck twelve she knew she hadta get out
84-2_1375.049_3.707.wav_ASR	so he left and left the prince there
84-2_1378.756_17.48.wav_ASR	and as he went out to the carriage the prince cinderella turned back into a servant
84-2_1396.299_11.02.wav_ASR	and the prince prince was really upset about what had happened
84-2_1407.593_17.28.wav_ASR	so he he sent some people from the from his his his some people from his castle to go out and see if they could find
84-2_1425.678_6.62.wav_ASR	and so he went to different houses and could not find anybody
84-2_1432.618_11.82.wav_ASR	when he went to the house where the two stepsisters live she she was wondering to know if anybody else was there
84-2_1444.93_13.02.wav_ASR	and somehow i think maybe he he figured out that the the young lady who was cinderella was in the other room
84-2_1458.25_1.72.wav_ASR	so he brought out cinderella
84-2_1460.57_2.92.wav_ASR	and the shoes fit
84-2_1463.42_8.56.wav_ASR	so he went back to the prince and told him about this person
84-2_1472.66_6.16.wav_ASR	and eventually the person became close again with the prince
84-2_1480.57_3.74.wav_ASR	and and in the end the prince and cinderella got married
84-2_1514.01_3.94.wav_ASR	but i don't remember what i talked about last week
84-2_1518.63_6.689.wav_ASR	so there was always a clock in my house growing up
84-2_1526.11_3.865.wav_ASR	and so i i knew pretty easily what time it was
84-2_1530.23_1.698.wav_ASR	oh i think i know the story
84-2_1531.9_8.72.wav_ASR	and so i remember especially in the high school that there wasn't really any time i hadta be home
84-2_1541.12_5.3.wav_ASR	so my parents said that you know whenever you get home it's fine
84-2_1546.84_4.825.wav_ASR	you know obviously not too late but you you wanna have a good time
84-2_1551.665_5.02.wav_ASR	so especially on friday and saturday nights we useta go out
84-2_1556.735_4.043.wav_ASR	you're to drink beer in one of my friends' basement and then go out
84-2_1561.105_4.17.wav_ASR	and so we would go to different parties which was a lot of fun
84-2_1565.275_7.34.wav_ASR	but i always made it home except one time i actually fell asleep at the wheel
84-2_1573.075_7.54.wav_ASR	but i was driving
84-2_1580.922_5.48.wav_ASR	one one of my friends who was named tl was in the other
84-2_1587.065_3.064.wav_ASR	and he he yelled at me
84-2_1590.202_0.83.wav_ASR	and i woke up
84-2_1591.802_1.28.wav_ASR	and it was in a stop
84-2_1593.302_0.94.wav_ASR	so nothing happened
84-2_1594.562_1.16.wav_ASR	but i was pretty lucky
84-2_1595.743_6.552.wav_ASR	so i guess it it's just good to know that a clock is always there knowing what time it is
84-2_1602.295_18.18.wav_ASR	and i i i then when i was in college i useta i dated a couple different different girls where i was from in in kentucky and in
84-2_1621.213_5.323.wav_ASR	and so i had a job that started at six o'clock in the morning during the summer
84-2_1626.636_8.781.wav_ASR	so i useta stay out with my friends or at my girlfriend's house until about four in the morning and then go go to work
84-2_1635.473_3.123.wav_ASR	or i would come home and get my bike and then go to work
84-2_1638.596_3.3.wav_ASR	so it was fun but it was also pretty exhausting
84-2_1661.747_12.78.wav_ASR	the only thing i can say about birds is that growing up i pretty much took birds for granted
84-2_1674.744_11.46.wav_ASR	and i remember even when i was in undergraduate and when i went to law school i i mean i never really thought about it
84-2_1686.85_16.941.wav_ASR	but as i started to get well i i i guess i should say that i worked a lot in when i was a lawyer
84-2_1703.791_4.937.wav_ASR	and then i went to a company where i was for a long time
84-2_1709.271_8.12.wav_ASR	but now that i'm looking for stuff to do one of the things i'm pretty interested in doing is birdwatching
84-2_1718.071_2.377.wav_ASR	so it's something i'm gonna try to do
84-2_1720.448_13.26.wav_ASR	but i i'm sure i told you but maybe i didn't that me and my wife are gonna move to south carolina and in the community there where i feel i can do some bird watching
84-2_1734.128_1.611.wav_ASR	so i like to try it
84-2_1735.948_1.252.wav_ASR	oh i'm good at it
84-2_1737.348_1.265.wav_ASR	oh i know what i'm doing
84-2_1738.613_8.402.wav_ASR	but it's important for me to find some hobbies that i can work on and try to feel feel good about it
84-2_1751.233_2.428.wav_ASR	oh we've already picked the place
84-2_1753.973_1.755.wav_ASR	oh kewo kewo kewo
84-2_1755.813_0.848.wav_ASR	they've ever been there
84-2_1757.804_3.6.wav_ASR	it's off the coast of
84-2_1763.495_4.149.wav_ASR	it's about forty minutes from the charlestown airport
84-2_1768.604_1.36.wav_ASR	and it's a beautiful
84-2_1772.244_3.34.wav_ASR	oh i don't wanna go into too much detail
84-2_1775.781_12.445.wav_ASR	but we we we are constructing a place there that's part of a condominium that's right on the beach
84-2_1788.901_5.343.wav_ASR	and so so i my wife is down there right now
84-2_1794.244_5.8.wav_ASR	so she could actually go into the building which is being constructed
84-2_1800.532_16.3.wav_ASR	and she was able to tell me that from my from where our condominium is placed my wife says that she can actually see the beach you know for the ocean
84-2_1817.192_13.006.wav_ASR	so for me that was really nice because i useta have a place in october maryland which my wife really liked that i didn't like so much
84-2_1830.198_1.1.wav_ASR	it was ready on the water
84-2_1831.912_4.94.wav_ASR	and so now i feel that i've been able to give something you know
84-2_1837.124_5.433.wav_ASR	so i've wanted to find the place that would be good for her
84-2_1843.004_3.038.wav_ASR	and i mean it's gonna be a little hot for me
84-2_1846.364_6.04.wav_ASR	but i think it's gonna be worth it because it's gonna be a great place for my wife
84-2_1861.804_4.88.wav_ASR	it's in south carolina or north carolina
84-2_1868.964_0.303.wav_ASR	alright
84-2_1877.712_1.04.wav_ASR	well it's pretty certain
84-2_1879.112_1.64.wav_ASR	and i'm not very concerned about it
84-2_1882.912_1.763.wav_ASR	it it i think it should be good
84-2_1885.012_4.164.wav_ASR	and we know some people down there who live there
84-2_1889.212_1.86.wav_ASR	so that's gonna be really helpful too
84-2_1891.217_9.274.wav_ASR	but the person i know really well made a fortune in in a company that he was in
84-2_1900.657_4.7.wav_ASR	so he has a lot of places now all over the world including canada
84-2_1929.085_7.92.wav_ASR	well probably the hotel i stayed in some nice hotel
84-2_1937.925_5.3.wav_ASR	but probably the nicest hotel i stayed in was for my wedding
84-2_1943.216_11.64.wav_ASR	and i married a a law student when i was in college who lived in washington dc
84-2_1955.736_3.62.wav_ASR	so we got married at the four seasons hotel in georgia
84-2_1960.256_1.29.wav_ASR	and that was the real nice place
84-2_1961.546_2.702.wav_ASR	we we were able to be there for a couple days
84-2_1964.566_2.56.wav_ASR	we had a fair amount of people at our wedding
84-2_1967.137_1.529.wav_ASR	it was about two hundred
84-2_1969.686_5.86.wav_ASR	and we were able to have a wedding on a sunday after
84-2_1976.586_2.56.wav_ASR	and we had a nice lunch
84-2_1979.209_12.504.wav_ASR	and then i remember that many of my friends went down to a bar earlier down in georgia town and with my wife and some friends and had a nice evening there
84-2_1992.089_1.731.wav_ASR	so for me it was a good place
84-2_1994.369_2.18.wav_ASR	but totally i like being home
84-2_1996.549_3.359.wav_ASR	so i you know i did it
84-2_1999.989_0.545.wav_ASR	it was good
84-2_2000.709_3.348.wav_ASR	you know i being where i am now
84-2_2196.154_4.351.wav_ASR	well i think i told you about my favorite restaurant in new york right
84-2_2200.505_1.925.wav_ASR	the one that i went to for about twenty years
84-2_2204.4_1.8.wav_ASR	oh i won't talk about that
84-2_2206.653_12.64.wav_ASR	well here in philadelphia i've gotten to know a few restaurants
84-2_2219.853_5.936.wav_ASR	because i lived here when i first took a job
84-2_2225.789_3.92.wav_ASR	but i was a law clerk for a judge in philadelphia
84-2_2230.669_3.36.wav_ASR	and then i lived here for awhile before i moved to princeton
84-2_2234.197_14.716.wav_ASR	but one of the places i like to eat a lot all though it's gone up in price a little bit is a restaurant called pl nl nl nl nl
84-2_2249.537_1.139.wav_ASR	and i don't know why i told you
84-2_2250.676_4.494.wav_ASR	but i useta be able to speak French pretty well
84-2_2255.756_5.814.wav_ASR	and i like going there because they have a lot of good food
84-2_2262.196_5.2.wav_ASR	it's gone to be overpriced like so many restaurants
84-2_2267.49_9.604.wav_ASR	but one thing i really like there is my my i have a hamburger that's really nice
84-2_2277.79_5.42.wav_ASR	and it's it can be cooked different ways
84-2_2283.415_9.06.wav_ASR	and i like my meat very very rare not cooked not completely cooked but cooked most of the way
84-2_2293.155_8.88.wav_ASR	and it's a really nice place to get a juicy burger and either a salad or some some french
84-2_2302.33_4.163.wav_ASR	but but the french fries are usually for my wife
84-2_2307.01_2.4.wav_ASR	so i usually write up getting a a set
84-2_2309.77_7.26.wav_ASR	but sometimes she makes me order the the
84-2_2336.29_0.91.wav_ASR	oh we had this too
84-2_2337.64_6.1.wav_ASR	well the peanut butter and jelly sandwich for me is pretty easy to make
84-2_2344.78_4.14.wav_ASR	go to the most of my bread is in the freezer
84-2_2349.56_2.46.wav_ASR	so i take out two pieces of bread
84-2_2352.03_13.906.wav_ASR	but i like a particular kind of peanut butter that is made at costa which has nothing but peanuts in it
84-2_2365.936_10.164.wav_ASR	and so i usually put when i have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich which lately has been a little more frequently for some reason i don't know
84-2_2376.676_2.695.wav_ASR	and then i'll take just about any jelly
84-2_2379.371_10.336.wav_ASR	but i've found a jelly at weddington that has three different types of fruit in it
84-2_2389.5_27.09.wav_ASR	and so i put that with some with some with the peanut butter on a bread that is a a type of wheat bread that i find to be to be very good
84-2_2416.69_4.042.wav_ASR	so i i'm i'm gonna have a sandwich a little later today
84-2_2420.83_1.92.wav_ASR	and i probably gonna have a turkey sandwich
84-2_2423.13_2.155.wav_ASR	but yeah i like peanut butter and jelly a lot
84-2_2425.63_8.46.wav_ASR	the i've got the sandwich down to a sandwich
84-2_2440.382_15.965.wav_ASR	well we i think i may have told you that we useta live in apartment that we owned across the hall
84-2_2456.416_4.325.wav_ASR	but we found somebody that we thought we could sell it to
84-2_2460.976_7.3.wav_ASR	and it turned out that he the two of them bought it at a price that i think was pretty good
84-2_2468.485_11.2.wav_ASR	so while we were waiting for the place to be built in kiera we moved it turns out across the hall where there's a rental unit
84-2_2479.5_13.0.wav_ASR	so and there's a washer and a dryer with the with with all the
84-2_2493.08_0.68.wav_ASR	the roads
84-2_2494.18_4.5.wav_ASR	all the locations i guess you could say have a washer and a dryer
84-2_2499.03_7.61.wav_ASR	so usually they're maybe a couple pieces of clothing that may go to the wedding
84-2_2506.81_8.7.wav_ASR	but for the most part i will open the jar
84-2_2516.541_5.6.wav_ASR	it's a washer that works it it operates from the inside
84-2_2522.721_4.203.wav_ASR	so i've put all the clothes in which is something i'm still able to do
84-2_2527.541_5.5.wav_ASR	and then i will turn on the wash
84-2_2533.721_1.86.wav_ASR	usually it's on a cold side
84-2_2535.923_4.6.wav_ASR	and once it starts moving a little bit i put in the detergent
84-2_2541.603_5.972.wav_ASR	and for some reason this this this washer takes a long time
84-2_2548.263_2.18.wav_ASR	but in about an hour it's done
84-2_2550.963_2.58.wav_ASR	and the clothes have always come up pretty clean
84-2_2553.677_3.5.wav_ASR	so i then put them in the dryer
84-2_2558.157_3.06.wav_ASR	and that's about another forty five minutes
84-2_2561.777_10.454.wav_ASR	but usually within two hours the clothes come out and they're ready to be folded which for me takes a while because i only have the one hand
84-2_2572.231_6.68.wav_ASR	so what i've tried to do is just limit the stuff that i like the stuff that goes in my closet
84-2_2579.691_1.311.wav_ASR	and lord's at her own
84-2_2582.091_6.46.wav_ASR	yeah she she her clothes get washed with mine but i can't really put them away
84-2_2588.911_1.977.wav_ASR	and she's got a lot more clothing than i do
84-2_2605.921_5.7.wav_ASR	well i i grew up with a lot of flowers
84-2_2612.441_6.897.wav_ASR	but somehow when i married firstnamea that was not one of the things that she was really interested in
84-2_2619.338_7.26.wav_ASR	so we we we have a few not a lot of fake flowers around our apartment
84-2_2627.098_3.1.wav_ASR	but i had a birthday in march
84-2_2630.778_6.74.wav_ASR	and one of the people i become very close with is a personal trainer named firstnamej
84-2_2637.618_7.84.wav_ASR	and so firstnameg has been with me for i think now for about two and a half years
84-2_2645.678_7.36.wav_ASR	and she got a small plot for me that is the only living plant in this area
84-2_2654.178_0.9.wav_ASR	and for some reason
84-2_2655.359_3.54.wav_ASR	but i got it at the end of
84-2_2661.499_3.353.wav_ASR	and for some reason the plan is still chuckling along
84-2_2664.959_0.989.wav_ASR	it's doing pretty well
84-2_2666.159_8.647.wav_ASR	so i feel good that i can keep a plan now for four months
84-2_2681.403_5.463.wav_ASR	the bigger exercises is that i don't hafta water it very often
84-2_2689.146_3.773.wav_ASR	but i can show it to you but i don't know what it is
84-2_2692.919_6.577.wav_ASR	maybe at the end if we have enough time i can see it
84-2_2699.679_5.76.wav_ASR	but it's just hard for me to see because it's on the window over there
84-2_2707.71_1.15.wav_ASR	if you're big enough
84-2_2725.24_2.756.wav_ASR	well find the easiest ones to start with

61-1_26.772_10.59.wav_ASR	first of all i i had a situation i
61-1_37.381_1.15.wav_ASR	but i couldn't speak
61-1_38.607_5.59.wav_ASR	and then as all of a sudden i started speaking again
61-1_45.366_12.18.wav_ASR	and i was two two forty seven over ninety
61-1_58.751_15.99.wav_ASR	so i ask to see go to the ambulance and go to the the

61-1_140.685_3.91.wav_ASR	and they got me out
61-1_144.655_8.54.wav_ASR	and they took me down to do another head scan
61-1_154.705_13.28.wav_ASR	and then they hooked me up to a bird airplane and drove me up to metropolis
61-1_169.781_4.37.wav_ASR	and then it gets kind of like
61-1_174.309_2.62.wav_ASR	umbrella
61-1_178.661_5.2.wav_ASR	well i wasn't performing much of anything
61-1_184.822_2.75.wav_ASR	and they kept me overnight
61-1_188.082_10.52.wav_ASR	and the next day i woke up and i i i was mostly talk but not very well
61-1_200.408_8.51.wav_ASR	and i started having all kinds of trouble
61-1_226.007_5.97.wav_ASR	well i i was in rehab for four or five weeks
61-1_233.191_11.69.wav_ASR	and i finally got to the point where i could almost you know walk with my walker
61-1_245.707_15.99.wav_ASR	and i could speak more terms and you know help me do better
61-1_262.172_3.67.wav_ASR	and i didn't have any movement of my arm
61-1_266.267_3.84.wav_ASR	umbrella
61-1_315.699_2.93.wav_ASR	and i did that for a a year

61-1_362.665_17.62.wav_ASR	and then i had three exercises that i did with my legs and my arms you know
61-1_380.9_21.52.wav_ASR	as far as the i didn't do any more speech speech mainly because the speech was gonna cost money

61-1_494.709_2.1.wav_ASR	so i i really enjoyed that
61-1_518.553_7.98.wav_ASR	well a boy was playing
61-1_528.141_1.88.wav_ASR	and he kicked it
61-1_530.607_1.18.wav_ASR	and it hit the window
61-1_533.027_1.13.wav_ASR	and it came through
61-1_535.235_9.91.wav_ASR	and the guy got up and looked out the window to see what what what caused the problem
61-1_576.326_1.63.wav_ASR	the mother says
61-1_578.502_0.9.wav_ASR	it's gonna rain
61-1_580.406_8.01.wav_ASR	and i'm gonna give you a umbrella
61-1_588.979_0.31.wav_ASR	and he's
61-1_589.931_1.01.wav_ASR	oh i don't want
61-1_592.076_3.31.wav_ASR	and so he walked and he walked
61-1_595.58_1.7.wav_ASR	and he was all dressed
61-1_598.168_0.88.wav_ASR	and he came home
61-1_599.072_1.87.wav_ASR	and he was all dressed
61-1_601.589_1.22.wav_ASR	and his mom said
61-1_603.285_1.59.wav_ASR	you should have taken the umbrella
61-1_606.37_4.87.wav_ASR	and the so he took the umbrella and carried it out in the rain
61-1_632.32_7.8.wav_ASR	well there was a cat that was up in the tree
61-1_640.874_3.84.wav_ASR	and so the guy got up there to try to help get the cat down
61-1_645.588_4.39.wav_ASR	there's a girl underneath trying to catch the cat
61-1_651.054_4.93.wav_ASR	and then they call for the firetruck
61-1_656.707_2.71.wav_ASR	and the two guys with the ladder
61-1_659.432_3.79.wav_ASR	the dog was kinda yep yep
61-1_663.272_13.78.wav_ASR	and and then they would have helped him
61-1_678.744_4.75.wav_ASR	and and they would've gone back to the station
61-1_686.144_0.92.wav_ASR	is that what you want
61-1_919.524_12.68.wav_ASR	umbrella was needed to take care of her
61-1_932.962_5.86.wav_ASR	so these two sisters decided to take care of her
61-1_939.695_14.76.wav_ASR	but they took and used her to find make their life easier by cooking and cleaning and all that stuff
61-1_955.23_28.59.wav_ASR	and then the a representative from the to allow them to go to the magical star
61-1_984.421_9.68.wav_ASR	and the the mother said no to the cinderella and yes to the two girls
61-1_994.715_9.13.wav_ASR	and they got a quick moment cinderella hooked them up with the
61-1_1003.869_16.48.wav_ASR	and she felt she would like to go but wasn't gonna be able
61-1_1094.545_5.59.wav_ASR	and she went ahead and went to the the thing
61-1_1100.159_2.85.wav_ASR	and and it was twelve o'clock
61-1_1103.418_2.55.wav_ASR	and she was running out of the
61-1_1106.476_6.11.wav_ASR	and she dropped one of her slippers
61-1_1113.602_8.23.wav_ASR	and then the pumpkin was down
61-1_1121.847_4.94.wav_ASR	and everybody was happy
61-1_1126.987_3.87.wav_ASR	well she was all
61-1_1131.671_11.07.wav_ASR	and then the guy came to try to fit on the shoe
61-1_1143.689_5.91.wav_ASR	and the the little girl the girls couldn't fit it
61-1_1150.328_4.82.wav_ASR	and finally they said
61-1_1155.34_1.2.wav_ASR	hey what about her
61-1_1157.179_0.93.wav_ASR	and they put it on
61-1_1159.019_6.12.wav_ASR	and she fit perfect
61-1_1166.031_13.87.wav_ASR	and they she she went married the prince
61-1_1183.039_1.84.wav_ASR	it's best i could do
61-1_1195.099_2.02.wav_ASR	and i would take the bread out
61-1_1198.866_11.06.wav_ASR	and i would get a a plate and put the bread on the plate
61-1_1210.828_7.54.wav_ASR	then i take a knife and

61-1_1302.453_2.39.wav_ASR	and then i slap the two pieces on there
61-1_1305.282_2.95.wav_ASR	and that's your
61-1_1310.138_1.54.wav_ASR	that's the way you do it
61-2_7.316_0.44.wav_ASR	there
61-2_10.544_1.21.wav_ASR	it's not great
61-2_11.806_1.61.wav_ASR	but it it is fair
61-2_19.88_0.6.wav_ASR	yes
61-2_25.748_4.71.wav_ASR	well the originally i was out

63-2_20.929_0.67.wav_ASR	that's what it is
63-2_21.647_1.36.wav_ASR	but i know what it
63-2_23.054_4.5.wav_ASR	and until someone tells me what it is i just can't say it
63-2_27.999_0.71.wav_ASR	oh i don't know why
63-2_28.733_2.26.wav_ASR	it's the way it is now
63-2_38.859_0.35.wav_ASR	yeah
63-2_44.303_3.08.wav_ASR	well i got up in the morning
63-2_48.081_2.82.wav_ASR	and right away i i i i rolled over
63-2_51.772_2.14.wav_ASR	because she she was by my side

63-2_76.575_5.33.wav_ASR	and then right after i did my thing something happened in here
63-2_83.156_2.36.wav_ASR	and i said
63-2_86.28_0.56.wav_ASR	oh no
63-2_87.247_4.1.wav_ASR	and that's the last thing i remember for weeks
63-2_110.622_8.52.wav_ASR	well the the last thing i knew before before my stroke hit was
63-2_119.546_6.29.wav_ASR	well after my stroke hit i woke up
63-2_125.884_5.95.wav_ASR	but i i remember this was an ambulance new york
63-2_131.943_3.96.wav_ASR	so the next thing i know i'm back in wichita
63-2_137.638_4.23.wav_ASR	and i on a bed
63-2_141.886_3.02.wav_ASR	my wife's there
63-2_145.895_8.26.wav_ASR	and and i slowly started talking to her
63-2_154.83_6.86.wav_ASR	but i don't think i made much sense to her
63-2_161.771_2.36.wav_ASR	but she was always there for me
63-2_166.318_5.94.wav_ASR	so it it it you know it was okay because i i could tell her anything i want
63-2_172.567_0.74.wav_ASR	and she missed
63-2_174.287_2.43.wav_ASR	dead or whatever she could
63-2_179.54_8.31.wav_ASR	and then after awhile two or three nurses would come in every day
63-2_187.899_9.62.wav_ASR	and that they would do crazy things like live my legs and lift my back
63-2_197.735_3.12.wav_ASR	and every day was something different
63-2_200.878_1.4.wav_ASR	and i would go down the hall
63-2_203.68_13.15.wav_ASR	and they would do leglis trying to get me whatever
63-2_216.852_3.61.wav_ASR	and i i would do stairs
63-2_220.72_2.27.wav_ASR	remember that i just there
63-2_223.735_6.54.wav_ASR	did a lot of
63-2_231.307_0.98.wav_ASR	then i don't know
63-2_232.337_1.88.wav_ASR	there's always somebody there
63-2_234.266_4.36.wav_ASR	and there were always always somebody doing something to me
63-2_238.866_2.82.wav_ASR	lot of it i don't know anymore
63-2_241.734_6.07.wav_ASR	but it it was very interesting
63-2_270.707_16.25.wav_ASR	well the the the the best thing i can remember before my stroke was getting married of course
63-2_287.802_2.96.wav_ASR	and i was in the service at the time

63-2_330.401_3.01.wav_ASR	had a lot of good memories about football
63-2_335.59_16.4.wav_ASR	yeah i i was not below my own home but after the session i was the best place dependent on the tree
63-2_352.759_1.93.wav_ASR	had a lot of insurance
63-2_356.795_1.32.wav_ASR	about a lot of things happened
63-2_358.702_5.14.wav_ASR	but there's a a lot of things
63-2_363.887_3.23.wav_ASR	oh there there's so much
63-2_367.253_10.28.wav_ASR	the fact you know oh there's so many things good and bad that happened to me
63-2_377.551_2.11.wav_ASR	but i i can't do it
63-2_379.803_3.54.wav_ASR	so in fact there's a lot of i don't even remember anymore
63-2_384.569_2.54.wav_ASR	they're either cruel or whatever
63-2_387.736_1.31.wav_ASR	but that that's the way it
63-2_411.303_0.58.wav_ASR	okay
63-2_413.03_4.45.wav_ASR	there there was a boy who kicked the ball
63-2_417.912_3.64.wav_ASR	and the ball went into a glass window
63-2_422.674_15.1.wav_ASR	and when it went went into the window and it hit the guy on the stairs and and knocked over the lamp
63-2_438.726_2.45.wav_ASR	and so he he grabbed the lamp
63-2_442.108_7.4.wav_ASR	and he he told him he wasn't getting it back until the lamp was fixed
63-2_481.005_0.36.wav_ASR	okay
63-2_481.732_8.03.wav_ASR	first of all the boy did not want to take an umbrella
63-2_491.361_5.2.wav_ASR	he he he said it was okay that she didn't have
63-2_497.241_6.7.wav_ASR	so he he he walked out in the rain and saw it was raining
63-2_504.464_2.37.wav_ASR	so she had she hadta go back home
63-2_508.083_4.21.wav_ASR	and he was all wet now
63-2_512.317_9.689.wav_ASR	and so she hadta get her umbrella
63-2_522.629_3.17.wav_ASR	and she put it in her hand
63-2_525.853_3.21.wav_ASR	and he went to school
63-2_544.992_0.48.wav_ASR	okay
63-2_557.835_3.71.wav_ASR	first of all i see a little girl
63-2_561.562_1.48.wav_ASR	girl and she's trying to get a cat
63-2_564.448_3.49.wav_ASR	but her her her ladder
63-2_568.152_0.97.wav_ASR	so she couldn't
63-2_569.138_10.13.wav_ASR	so she she went to her father father who couldn't get it either because the the ladder was gone
63-2_579.979_9.18.wav_ASR	and he had a dog
63-2_589.176_4.92.wav_ASR	and had a
63-2_594.116_4.12.wav_ASR	dog and he up up the tree trying to get
63-2_599.141_4.71.wav_ASR	and so because she couldn't
63-2_603.984_1.24.wav_ASR	and she couldn't get the cat
63-2_606.497_1.25.wav_ASR	couldn't get the dog
63-2_608.377_9.35.wav_ASR	and she went with the firemen who got her out and got everything back to normal
63-2_1440.511_0.74.wav_ASR	okay
63-2_1441.268_16.0.wav_ASR	when the grandmother and her two grandchildren were small they brought in cinderella to clean up the house
63-2_1458.806_6.78.wav_ASR	and cinderella did all the work
63-2_1466.686_10.03.wav_ASR	and as kids got older there were more things for cinderella to do that they wouldn't do
63-2_1478.756_14.77.wav_ASR	and finally they they got an invitation from the prince that there was gonna be a gala at the prince's palace
63-2_1495.182_6.21.wav_ASR	and they they told her she couldn't go because she wasn't invited
63-2_1501.414_1.13.wav_ASR	they're only late
63-2_1503.72_13.93.wav_ASR	so after they were gone the fairy godmother showed up and and she showed them how she could do it
63-2_1518.63_15.49.wav_ASR	and so the first thing the fairy godmother did was turn all the mice and everything into the carriage and the horse and the
63-2_1535.312_12.67.wav_ASR	and then cinderella was was given a fine dress to wear
63-2_1549.523_20.5.wav_ASR	and then when she got to the ball the only thing the prince could see nothing but cinderella
63-2_1571.01_3.63.wav_ASR	and they dance the night away
63-2_1575.707_4.89.wav_ASR	and then at twelve o'clock she says she hadta
63-2_1580.617_5.67.wav_ASR	oh and while she was going one of her slippers was left on the ground
63-2_1586.306_15.28.wav_ASR	so when she got home cinderella was back on her and her shady clothes and with the dogs and cats and everything
63-2_1601.634_26.69.wav_ASR	and then the the shoe was sposta be broken by the the ugly mother
63-2_1629.078_3.66.wav_ASR	but they they it was
63-2_1632.753_6.42.wav_ASR	and and so cinderella put on a
63-2_1639.194_4.61.wav_ASR	and it was exact match of other other
63-2_1644.445_0.98.wav_ASR	so she knew it
63-2_1646.792_3.37.wav_ASR	and so her prince got married
63-2_1650.177_1.77.wav_ASR	and he lived happily ever after
63-2_1666.397_8.74.wav_ASR	you put on one once you put two slices of bread together
63-2_1675.69_2.37.wav_ASR	one with peanut butter one with jelly
63-2_1678.161_2.74.wav_ASR	and you get them together
63-2_1680.917_3.87.wav_ASR	and you got a peanut butter and jelly sandwich
65-1_9.517_0.96.wav_ASR	seems to be active
65-1_28.81_2.53.wav_ASR	the eighty four incident the last time i remember it's five days before
65-1_35.471_0.49.wav_ASR	well she
65-1_36.531_2.9.wav_ASR	they happened on a thursday march the eighteenth four
65-1_40.334_5.76.wav_ASR	remember we were at some friends' house having supper the previous saturday night
65-1_46.238_15.54.wav_ASR	and i remember nothing nothing after that until until after about i c u and started started remembering things slowly about three days after i moved out of i c u
65-1_63.223_3.95.wav_ASR	and i the eighteen ninety
65-1_67.496_0.83.wav_ASR	and i see the
65-1_69.041_4.34.wav_ASR	was crossing tennis street in an ambulance
65-1_74.421_2.67.wav_ASR	and i remember crossing in the pedestrian crosswalk
65-1_77.109_7.56.wav_ASR	he's crossing with the light and getting up close to the corner panel on the car going from west to east
65-1_86.021_1.74.wav_ASR	and then i had the insurance they're running around
65-1_87.783_6.82.wav_ASR	then then last i remember for probably twenty twenty twenty minutes or so
65-1_104.608_1.57.wav_ASR	the other one
65-1_107.092_0.66.wav_ASR	it's one and two
65-1_107.8_10.32.wav_ASR	it was very trouble because really trouble because didn't know where i was
65-1_119.162_6.17.wav_ASR	and there were visitors in the hospital room in my hospital room
65-1_125.543_3.84.wav_ASR	and these guys were saying they the the visitor
65-1_129.431_3.17.wav_ASR	and i knew who they were knew the these these people
65-1_132.616_1.52.wav_ASR	but there's lots of them
65-1_134.184_1.5.wav_ASR	they didn't know where i was
65-1_136.291_2.12.wav_ASR	there were several people visiting me
65-1_138.802_1.63.wav_ASR	and and there's several of us
65-1_141.127_1.76.wav_ASR	oh when when it's his voice's gonna come back
65-1_143.169_1.03.wav_ASR	when i was a boy i'm gonna come back
65-1_145.808_1.58.wav_ASR	and i thought i was perfect
65-1_148.727_11.07.wav_ASR	and but what i didn't know was that it's spent ten days with a breathing tube hooked down my throat in a coma
65-1_160.403_2.47.wav_ASR	and then look it was gonna come out every time
65-1_162.888_1.7.wav_ASR	and they gave me a tricycle
65-1_165.547_13.33.wav_ASR	and and so the the what turned out to be a scorching tuesday and o'clock o'clock and four o'clock changed my voice pretty rapidly where where my wife had had told me
65-1_178.901_7.83.wav_ASR	and she said that the you you you had the dance
65-1_190.21_0.31.wav_ASR	so i said
65-1_190.701_1.11.wav_ASR	actually there were
65-1_191.914_1.46.wav_ASR	the one thing they like about me
65-1_193.584_0.55.wav_ASR	and that was gone
65-1_194.184_7.67.wav_ASR	so but that was it was extremely troubleling because i i i didn't know where i was
65-1_202.556_3.45.wav_ASR	when people's recognize it's they recognize the same
65-1_206.835_1.36.wav_ASR	when it's wife's gonna come back
65-1_208.855_1.99.wav_ASR	and i was really really really trouble
65-1_211.097_0.7.wav_ASR	really trouble
65-1_214.441_2.34.wav_ASR	that was one of the first of my memories
65-1_227.068_4.71.wav_ASR	well it's what what in the
65-1_232.093_9.72.wav_ASR	and terms of my brain injury if you will certain things kinda stand out and were important to me
65-1_242.008_14.18.wav_ASR	and it just when when when i happen to get confused on something i didn't particularly understand or or improve of i get get confused
65-1_256.236_2.98.wav_ASR	it was extremely angry
65-1_261.478_2.001.wav_ASR	and did everybody else
65-1_264.808_2.63.wav_ASR	but just really really angry
65-1_267.486_1.47.wav_ASR	and i got on the train
65-1_268.978_5.53.wav_ASR	but it was very very very trouble really trouble for a lot for for quite awhile
65-1_291.425_2.81.wav_ASR	and and and and i don't want you ever to relate to that
65-1_294.408_3.91.wav_ASR	oh i wouldn't would wouldn't work at all
65-1_316.655_7.65.wav_ASR	the almost ninety nine is almost what
65-1_324.396_0.55.wav_ASR	again
65-1_325.376_0.84.wav_ASR	and that's what it was
65-1_326.232_3.43.wav_ASR	it was just just a reunion but not really as severe
65-1_330.55_12.55.wav_ASR	but the the eighty four was was was most interesting because because an engineer for my the company i'm employed by
65-1_343.181_6.64.wav_ASR	but i was on what they call the high patient's list meaning i had a wonderful career ahead of me
65-1_349.842_1.58.wav_ASR	he was gonna go four and everything
65-1_352.182_4.66.wav_ASR	and and my one of my employees told me
65-1_356.862_0.89.wav_ASR	he was sposta do it
65-1_357.802_6.2.wav_ASR	took me told me i was on the hospital list which meant i was going far
65-1_364.136_1.18.wav_ASR	my career's laid out front of me
65-1_366.048_2.15.wav_ASR	there was nothing shopping there
65-1_369.12_8.58.wav_ASR	and then after the eighty four incident personal change which i find out twenty years later's encephalitis
65-1_377.717_1.63.wav_ASR	we're i find it twenty years later
65-1_380.151_3.17.wav_ASR	and i and my son and my son's son
65-1_384.141_2.67.wav_ASR	slowly to complete the thing
65-1_387.869_5.87.wav_ASR	but finally did after taking taking more time for company and everything
65-1_393.757_7.06.wav_ASR	and and and and i couldn't do my engineering job to to to suit me
65-1_401.669_1.51.wav_ASR	and i didn't tell anybody that
65-1_403.668_0.89.wav_ASR	but i didn't tell anybody
65-1_404.612_0.8.wav_ASR	tricycle
65-1_406.295_17.87.wav_ASR	and i fake it and spent my lunch hours by myself in a conference room the learning aspect of my job and not telling a story because i just
65-1_424.226_1.26.wav_ASR	it's before four twenty eight
65-1_426.413_1.47.wav_ASR	they ate nine eighty four again
65-1_428.188_2.09.wav_ASR	action before the emergency of disaster
65-1_430.428_0.54.wav_ASR	hey
65-1_432.046_2.46.wav_ASR	and on the second night four
65-1_434.528_1.11.wav_ASR	one i don't company business
65-1_436.8_5.82.wav_ASR	and i i just knew that that my ability to comprehend basic aspects of my job
65-1_443.288_1.95.wav_ASR	actually i just knew i was gonna get fired
65-1_445.562_0.85.wav_ASR	and i knew i was
65-1_447.165_8.14.wav_ASR	had three kids a wife and sposta just lovely lovely woman there at home with the three kids
65-1_455.32_2.19.wav_ASR	and i was the engineer
65-1_458.431_2.45.wav_ASR	and i couldn't stand the thought of being fire
65-1_461.855_5.49.wav_ASR	and and so i'd say got did everything i could to relearn my job
65-1_467.981_7.74.wav_ASR	but it did take me probably couple three years to figure out that that i was no longer on the fast track
65-1_476.146_1.08.wav_ASR	and no no no
65-1_477.247_2.36.wav_ASR	it wasn't obvious at first
65-1_479.684_3.22.wav_ASR	but i there was no longer a fashion
65-1_482.928_9.4.wav_ASR	and and the biggest most difficult part of that was the short term memory loss
65-1_493.261_11.8.wav_ASR	and so i ended up with a franklin plan and would write down everything just to help my help my short term memory
65-1_506.11_10.319.wav_ASR	so it was a fairly the aphasia and and people seeing me differently at work
65-1_516.482_4.701.wav_ASR	and and of course i look back on it a few years after
65-1_521.2_2.859.wav_ASR	and and i did not deserve to be on the fast track
65-1_524.107_3.97.wav_ASR	but it it it it was particularly obvious to everybody around me
65-1_528.092_0.72.wav_ASR	it was not very nice
65-1_530.176_14.41.wav_ASR	and that the writing everything down was was the biggest a a a assistant assistant assistant to me that to help help me with my job
65-1_567.07_6.54.wav_ASR	the basically there's the the
65-1_573.891_4.62.wav_ASR	praise i i call it pure eighty four percent positive
65-1_579.419_5.17.wav_ASR	that's that's how my my my life has been defined
65-1_585.51_11.37.wav_ASR	and it's i just that that is what i call my my my defending moment or the the the finishing event
65-1_597.64_8.89.wav_ASR	because i've struggled with the aphasia obviously and memory issues ever since then
65-1_606.552_13.22.wav_ASR	and and and i mean for example the the the the window of seventy six seventy seven is out of engine scope of purdue
65-1_619.826_1.84.wav_ASR	had a job in annapolis
65-1_621.855_7.67.wav_ASR	and so the eight and eight automatic vehicle i i i paid rent to my folks who lived in the house
65-1_630.113_6.18.wav_ASR	and that window my dad and i put the umbrella veil in a little small car
65-1_637.015_3.44.wav_ASR	and it was quite an interesting interesting project
65-1_641.315_4.08.wav_ASR	and and interesting enough i can probably
65-1_645.41_8.3.wav_ASR	the the the engine had a rooster four roosters on it which had some difficulty
65-1_653.791_1.8.wav_ASR	and i could probably still today
65-1_655.869_1.58.wav_ASR	and this is nineteen seventy six
65-1_658.288_2.76.wav_ASR	probably still they rebuild the car or something
65-1_662.6_3.89.wav_ASR	but but but but ask me what i had for supper last night
65-1_667.122_0.49.wav_ASR	can't talk
65-1_669.274_0.66.wav_ASR	so yeah
65-1_670.235_1.4.wav_ASR	short short memory
65-1_671.658_13.02.wav_ASR	but but then things from from from long ago and do do do something something long ago i i can recover like as usual
65-1_695.671_5.07.wav_ASR	and no actually i was ended up like that's pretty much
65-1_701.591_4.64.wav_ASR	and and i got out of school the spring of seventy six
65-1_706.317_1.95.wav_ASR	had a job at the company name swimmer
65-1_709.739_0.87.wav_ASR	they're in an ambulance
65-1_710.687_2.65.wav_ASR	andwiches and switzerland no longer exists
65-1_714.262_5.09.wav_ASR	but i was an engineer engineer at that with the switch
65-1_720.011_10.31.wav_ASR	so so i my my customers for will call it for four hundred dollars
65-1_731.149_9.58.wav_ASR	the one of the small four parts of the castle
65-1_745.046_7.51.wav_ASR	and the c t m b m b m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m
65-1_753.154_4.14.wav_ASR	so i was already doing that kind of stuff as my as as a job
65-1_758.166_6.91.wav_ASR	but then my my father found this this hard on an engineering career
65-1_765.797_12.68.wav_ASR	and it just happened to be that it was a project for he and i the the building together that went well while while i was working in the otodome institute
65-1_778.497_8.96.wav_ASR	and and it's kind of how i graduated
65-1_815.779_2.14.wav_ASR	well i mean it was a real slipper
65-1_818.492_4.39.wav_ASR	and the the hot car at the time was the the tops and two forty sea
65-1_823.884_3.99.wav_ASR	it was at the first of the
65-1_828.597_6.2.wav_ASR	and and he useta from a stoplight dash those guys off
65-1_835.141_6.83.wav_ASR	and the the other guys the the the drivers the cops couldn't figure how the hell it's big
65-1_842.229_5.21.wav_ASR	it's it was a lot of fun seeing looks in our faces as it and then my river
65-1_910.099_1.2.wav_ASR	oh okay
65-1_911.875_2.36.wav_ASR	the story is there's a a young lad
65-1_914.589_8.46.wav_ASR	looks like maybe maybe twenty eight at six square or seven square and kicking a soccer ball
65-1_923.492_6.72.wav_ASR	and then an hour kick kicks the soccer ball through a a house's window
65-1_930.915_8.97.wav_ASR	and the soccer ball comes through the window window and and lands on a a a a adult male's lap in the house
65-1_940.813_7.32.wav_ASR	and the adult male gets holding the soccer ball and looks through the window and says trying to figure out what's going on
65-1_951.714_0.38.wav_ASR	they done
65-1_971.063_5.65.wav_ASR	looks like a a young boy is leaving
65-1_976.736_2.88.wav_ASR	and as his mother says
65-1_979.897_1.4.wav_ASR	here's your umbrella
65-1_981.983_0.84.wav_ASR	and he said
65-1_983.049_1.03.wav_ASR	and i don't need that
65-1_984.13_4.77.wav_ASR	and then then he leaves leaving saying goodbye and everything
65-1_989.831_1.61.wav_ASR	and the mom's holding the umbrella
65-1_991.969_3.23.wav_ASR	and the the young lad is out and about walking around
65-1_995.914_1.2.wav_ASR	and it starts to rain
65-1_997.78_1.36.wav_ASR	and it starts to rain
65-1_999.75_0.79.wav_ASR	and he's running
65-1_1000.563_4.18.wav_ASR	and he gets back to his his mom so soaked in wet
65-1_1005.358_0.87.wav_ASR	and he's not happy
65-1_1006.245_1.13.wav_ASR	you know it's nicer she happy
65-1_1008.212_2.37.wav_ASR	and then he goes out finally with the umbrella
65-1_1010.631_3.09.wav_ASR	and and and it looks like all his
65-1_1027.309_5.9.wav_ASR	well the beginning it looks like a cat a pet cat that climbed up a tree
65-1_1034.269_3.46.wav_ASR	and being probably chased by a dog come up the tree
65-1_1038.222_1.16.wav_ASR	had stuck up in the tree
65-1_1040.013_8.761.wav_ASR	little girl she was probably her owner over there in her tricycle and then once upon a cat down
65-1_1049.333_10.48.wav_ASR	and looks like an adult male figure most likely her dad that climbed up the tree to get the cat and is and it's caught up there by this barking dog
65-1_1060.56_5.52.wav_ASR	also and now then there's also a a bird over other side of the tree singing away
65-1_1066.533_11.02.wav_ASR	and there's also the the male figure
65-1_1077.577_2.22.wav_ASR	that's that's that's that's that's that's that's
65-1_1353.355_0.3.wav_ASR	thank you
65-1_1353.835_5.45.wav_ASR	her mother had passed away
65-1_1360.127_2.77.wav_ASR	father married
65-1_1363.72_8.84.wav_ASR	and there's the wicked stepmother that brought with her two two rather mean and bitter daughters
65-1_1373.655_13.75.wav_ASR	and and in their home life the cinderella's treated poorly by the stepmother and abused how we say by the stepdaughters
65-1_1387.769_7.59.wav_ASR	and and it just worked worked a lot
65-1_1395.968_9.9.wav_ASR	and then in the kingdom the king had a a a married son
65-1_1406.524_19.39.wav_ASR	and one of his employees decided to have a ball to with the the prince married off
65-1_1427.134_24.41.wav_ASR	and so cinderella with the help of the mice and there in the house sewed up a a really lovely gown for cinderella to wear to to wear to where it were at this ball
65-1_1451.694_17.08.wav_ASR	and and the stepmother was angry on getting one of her her her daughters married off and and and then so would not allow cinderella to go to the ball
65-1_1469.504_3.98.wav_ASR	her stepsisters went
65-1_1474.182_11.98.wav_ASR	and and a carriage was looking like a a pumpkin and then mice went up but turned into horses
65-1_1486.874_8.89.wav_ASR	and i think the the the horse from the house ended up as the the driver of the the pumpkin carriage
65-1_1496.594_3.35.wav_ASR	and she she she hadta go to the ball
65-1_1499.966_5.76.wav_ASR	also the the prince danced and night away with a cinderella
65-1_1506.4_12.64.wav_ASR	but the stepmother was he hadta be back by midnight because everything was gonna go back to the way it was at midnight
65-1_1519.217_1.04.wav_ASR	so there was
65-1_1520.273_3.71.wav_ASR	so she heard out of there and left a glass slipper behind
65-1_1524.602_11.17.wav_ASR	and then after the the the the prince says there's only one person interested
65-1_1535.789_2.93.wav_ASR	and it was the the gal that left the glass slipper behind
65-1_1538.769_9.72.wav_ASR	and and so the the abuse was sent through the kingdom to try and figure out who was that the lady left a glass slipper behind
65-1_1549.451_11.43.wav_ASR	and and it was the the the lady who's who's foot would fit this this small quite small glass slipper
65-1_1561.723_3.47.wav_ASR	and the stepsisters neither one on the fit the glass slipper
65-1_1565.701_3.72.wav_ASR	slipper cinderella's foot would fit in the slipper
65-1_1569.443_7.35.wav_ASR	and so she was invited as the one that the prince wanted to marry
65-1_1576.915_5.67.wav_ASR	and and so then the the the cinderella married the prince
65-1_1582.609_2.0.wav_ASR	and they live happily ever after
65-1_1595.381_4.76.wav_ASR	preferly on on wheat bread
65-1_1600.8_8.05.wav_ASR	you'd use a knife and and spread the spread the peanut butter on one side of the bread
65-1_1609.79_6.11.wav_ASR	but then the other side of the bread the other other bread the operational jelly is grape jelly
65-1_1617.339_1.5.wav_ASR	and then she take a spoon
65-1_1619.081_5.76.wav_ASR	now not knife because he he cut up the the the the jelly and the and the jar
65-1_1624.893_6.9.wav_ASR	but but you take your spoon and and spoon out the the grape jelly on the other piece of bread
65-1_1632.163_2.41.wav_ASR	use the knife spread it out
65-1_1634.597_2.32.wav_ASR	and then then put the two halves together
65-1_1636.935_3.5.wav_ASR	and you got the ultimate peanut butter and jelly sandwich
65-2_8.167_1.85.wav_ASR	spreads on the bread
65-2_10.563_0.77.wav_ASR	much improve
65-2_12.338_9.08.wav_ASR	the the the whole thing of speaking and searching for words occurs less than it did
65-2_22.185_23.08.wav_ASR	the what what happens is that the if i have an association to tell a story or something like that i will maybe do it in the most basic form and and then think later on
65-2_45.514_1.3.wav_ASR	and i should've said it
65-2_46.935_0.67.wav_ASR	couldn't say that
65-2_48.111_1.09.wav_ASR	why why didn't i say
65-2_49.95_6.53.wav_ASR	of course in the trouble shooting the automobile license if there's some difficulty with the car
65-2_57.16_5.08.wav_ASR	it helps eventually if i think about it for about a day or so
65-2_62.323_26.47.wav_ASR	and and i've seen it before the the the the most of the most important aspect of the problem technically a lot of time is the is the most of the most important aspect of the problem technically a lot of time
65-2_89.557_8.62.wav_ASR	and i'll after that i get a headache
65-2_98.79_1.57.wav_ASR	why didn't i think of that before
65-2_100.765_5.64.wav_ASR	four i i before before my eighty four action i would have thought of that immediately
65-2_107.061_5.26.wav_ASR	but it's much more difficult and and takes a longer than it did
65-2_112.37_1.84.wav_ASR	and that's it's nice
65-2_114.233_1.4.wav_ASR	been that way for thirteen years
65-2_127.18_6.21.wav_ASR	the first one was a where i was tibbons at an intersection
65-2_134.294_2.7.wav_ASR	and ended up being
65-2_137.011_6.39.wav_ASR	and i got the old hospital hospital in the driver's side
65-2_144.01_12.54.wav_ASR	and had a chaperone a a basic small scale football a a a baseball softball league
65-2_157.19_1.61.wav_ASR	did i did i say pumpkin
65-2_159.526_1.7.wav_ASR	seventy years old
65-2_161.937_1.51.wav_ASR	the three of us
65-2_164.72_6.62.wav_ASR	and in i in a coma for three and a half weeks
65-2_172.132_7.28.wav_ASR	hospital probably probably about two and a half months
65-2_180.19_6.53.wav_ASR	and her third child was born three days after i was moved out of i c u
65-2_190.003_8.12.wav_ASR	and the second one was february of nineteen ninety nine
65-2_199.113_2.48.wav_ASR	it was a shower of water on the left side
65-2_202.563_6.32.wav_ASR	and i believe that i was unconscious for
65-2_209.678_1.66.wav_ASR	well i i guess i don't know how long
65-2_212.237_10.04.wav_ASR	but i recall walking across the street starting across across and seeing the car in front of me
65-2_223.056_2.51.wav_ASR	and then i had the session the session being spent around
65-2_226.386_7.17.wav_ASR	and then later first i remember things maybe
65-2_234.386_0.46.wav_ASR	five i don't know
65-2_234.865_0.96.wav_ASR	twenty minutes later
65-2_236.459_2.59.wav_ASR	and and i i was in a great marriage
65-2_239.878_5.52.wav_ASR	it was in a wonderful mood because the eighty four accident the last time i remember it's five days before the accident
65-2_246.349_7.14.wav_ASR	and then this one in february nineteen ninety i knew exactly where i was what i was doing and what happened
65-2_254.174_2.51.wav_ASR	and i was in a really great mood
65-2_257.551_13.19.wav_ASR	and then i say a brain injury because i think it was about one day or two days later and i developed a a double vision
65-2_271.809_19.88.wav_ASR	and i had that was the most except for of exercise for the the not knowing if the double vision would ever go away was a most concerning if you were
65-2_292.55_3.94.wav_ASR	it did finally go away when the brain swelling went down
65-2_296.863_0.66.wav_ASR	finally we were there
65-2_297.627_3.16.wav_ASR	and i recall maybe three four or five
65-2_303.117_1.68.wav_ASR	the last time i seen him was in the afternoon of the time
65-2_305.602_7.65.wav_ASR	and and the doctors could not tell me whether the the the evolution would ever go on
65-2_313.306_5.33.wav_ASR	it was extremely painful
65-2_318.652_8.33.wav_ASR	and and i recall that the orthopedic guy that it stuck a pen in my my my tibia said
65-2_327.006_12.71.wav_ASR	oh after after three or four months when when the all the the the fish and the i and the taxi ambulance started to heal he said
65-2_340.67_4.18.wav_ASR	oh boy you know that's probably the most painful injury you've ever known pain
65-2_345.576_0.85.wav_ASR	oh okay
65-2_346.527_1.96.wav_ASR	yeah well that's just me being a big baby then right
65-2_349.558_1.88.wav_ASR	and then he he he kicked the ball
65-2_353.552_2.83.wav_ASR	that's kind of it
65-2_356.478_4.01.wav_ASR	but those are the two actions and and at a top of it
65-2_372.985_7.65.wav_ASR	oh west's tenth and tenth and tenth and gone to my apartment at alison's going in to my apartment
65-2_399.4_12.1.wav_ASR	the after the first eighty four instances when i did not know
65-2_411.553_17.22.wav_ASR	what what what happened was at the about the company
65-2_429.508_17.32.wav_ASR	and and my my boss at that time right one brought one down for me to
65-2_447.04_0.75.wav_ASR	oh well
65-2_449.397_1.27.wav_ASR	oh what say we're we're playing
65-2_450.939_2.51.wav_ASR	but learn how to use their their home
65-2_454.232_6.24.wav_ASR	and of course this is before the web twenty four and and those kinda things
65-2_460.758_11.03.wav_ASR	and i i've been doing a nassau street and which is nassau street for quite a long time
65-2_472.499_9.05.wav_ASR	and but that was all on ibm a a punch card and that kind of stuff or or a desk top computer
65-2_482.344_4.62.wav_ASR	and and so here's a a simple little laptop
65-2_486.979_1.14.wav_ASR	don't even bother to use it
65-2_488.329_4.44.wav_ASR	and and so my my boss brought his lap top down
65-2_492.784_4.6.wav_ASR	and and in those years there was a a university of maryland that came along with me
65-2_498.448_4.81.wav_ASR	and try to use a a computer a computer use a manual
65-2_503.994_7.47.wav_ASR	if you've read a microsocce manual of any kind they are extremely difficult
65-2_512.342_14.661.wav_ASR	and one of the one one thing in particular which was was was probably when it said to select something
65-2_528.184_0.51.wav_ASR	slipper
65-2_528.839_12.43.wav_ASR	well have you ever had any training in in a lap top or microwaves oh what what what did select me
65-2_542.262_6.07.wav_ASR	and and after several days of trying to figure out what select method
65-2_548.888_1.04.wav_ASR	there's a little happy
65-2_550.399_0.6.wav_ASR	slip me
65-2_551.438_0.49.wav_ASR	aphasia
65-2_552.509_5.58.wav_ASR	slipper what what they met by slipper i couldn't figure it
65-2_558.551_0.56.wav_ASR	it could
65-2_559.312_1.04.wav_ASR	there's no way
65-2_560.944_2.31.wav_ASR	and i'm extremely really trouble by
65-2_564.422_5.97.wav_ASR	and so so finally i called a coworker and said
65-2_570.608_3.88.wav_ASR	what what what does this mean when they say select
65-2_575.568_7.44.wav_ASR	and it described the head tapping the corner and moving the cursor along the course
65-2_583.899_1.23.wav_ASR	that's what they met by salt
65-2_585.777_2.95.wav_ASR	well hell that was never described in the manual
65-2_589.857_3.86.wav_ASR	and that that that really that through me for a long time
65-2_594.838_7.3.wav_ASR	and so i i became very questioning as to whether whether i would could go back to work and even function at work
65-2_603.43_5.21.wav_ASR	and and so finally the the they're saying they they've they've taken the the the the cat from the tree
65-2_609.025_0.57.wav_ASR	oh okay
65-2_609.645_8.98.wav_ASR	but it was most basic of terms which the the
65-2_619.047_2.1.wav_ASR	but i know those there's dogs on my motorcycle
65-2_621.166_1.3.wav_ASR	it was before my motorcycle experience
65-2_623.365_14.01.wav_ASR	there's somebody would would have the the gall and stuff like that to have the the the golf and stuff in the movie of salt
65-2_638.605_1.01.wav_ASR	they did not
65-2_640.35_2.3.wav_ASR	daos and a man it did not describe that anywhere
65-2_643.738_14.19.wav_ASR	and so i went back to work and struggling with the aphasia and short term memory issues and the language and and trying to to to function
65-2_658.457_15.64.wav_ASR	and and finally my my after a couple of years the company brought out a what they call the franklin plan and and said
65-2_675.07_5.2.wav_ASR	you might take the take the football and then right stuff down
65-2_681.229_2.47.wav_ASR	and so well that was the good thing
65-2_684.72_2.15.wav_ASR	mean just being able to the right right thing down
65-2_686.892_1.67.wav_ASR	so i i carry my phone
65-2_689.233_0.96.wav_ASR	have you ever been right now
65-2_690.968_8.11.wav_ASR	still i care a small small notebook where i go yeah today
65-2_699.671_10.58.wav_ASR	because that was writing when i figured out it when when my my boss told me to come to the right stuff down with a franklin plan
65-2_710.85_7.47.wav_ASR	oh the magic that was oh no new new lease on life if you will
65-2_719.266_2.66.wav_ASR	but that's them perfect
65-2_721.95_17.32.wav_ASR	and and also i ended up as a lawyer as a account manager for the company in the defense projects meeting all kinds of people
65-2_739.905_10.88.wav_ASR	and i develop a tricks where i when i meet somebody new i will always say their name over and over and over again silently to myself
65-2_751.358_5.4.wav_ASR	use their name and any kind of verbal conversation with them
65-2_757.276_2.99.wav_ASR	use the name every time first or last name or or both
65-2_760.315_4.68.wav_ASR	and and then after the after the conversation write their name down
65-2_766.354_8.45.wav_ASR	and and that's a a bicycle that i that i still use today
65-2_775.921_2.94.wav_ASR	for example i met a in her neighbor's meeting
65-2_779.492_1.18.wav_ASR	but i'm i'm at home now
65-2_781.203_0.98.wav_ASR	not down the farm
65-2_782.926_11.55.wav_ASR	met a fellow and then the neighbor out for a walk of several days ago and and and moved to the neighborhood some time back
65-2_794.526_1.25.wav_ASR	and i got my name
65-2_795.797_6.87.wav_ASR	and saw his name over and over again and told my wife about it and then then rode it down
65-2_803.378_7.6.wav_ASR	and this morning i saw him out for a walk and and couldn't recall his name of course but then thought for awhile
65-2_810.996_1.51.wav_ASR	and then finally finally the name came through
65-2_813.742_14.39.wav_ASR	so but but the the disability on on recovering names is quite as been quite quite an invaluable to me and helped me to return to functional
65-2_839.375_0.52.wav_ASR	yes
65-2_840.697_4.78.wav_ASR	the i think i spent a last week
65-2_846.085_1.32.wav_ASR	but maybe
65-2_847.746_4.92.wav_ASR	time i spent in the time as a at the rehab hospital in denver as a volunteer
65-2_853.54_6.13.wav_ASR	and because i started to o f four which is twenty years after the eighty four hundred
65-2_860.446_8.79.wav_ASR	and it became rather troublesome to me because having they just didn't do therapy for the brain and those years
65-2_869.993_1.69.wav_ASR	so there's no therapy
65-2_871.699_1.97.wav_ASR	you're you're able to drive
65-2_873.684_3.67.wav_ASR	but i think you able to do a good job
65-2_878.184_5.53.wav_ASR	and because they just did not do therapy in those years
65-2_883.737_16.3.wav_ASR	and and over the course of next twenty years oh wife and i found out from people that had head therapy brain injuries later that the divorce rate increased by nearly forty percent
65-2_901.056_3.61.wav_ASR	and the scuba ride is four to five times a week
65-2_905.719_4.72.wav_ASR	there's what they're telling people even fifteen years ago
65-2_911.291_15.93.wav_ASR	and so i wanted to share that with patients and firstnamea just to give them hope that that recovery is is possible
65-2_928.404_1.38.wav_ASR	it years take a long time
65-2_930.61_10.94.wav_ASR	and in oh four when i started there it was i heard neurosurgeons telling patients and their families
65-2_942.297_1.58.wav_ASR	oh a year and a year and a half
65-2_944.156_1.01.wav_ASR	here's a year and a half
65-2_945.302_0.94.wav_ASR	here you go
65-2_947.407_3.51.wav_ASR	hey you don't stop recovering
65-2_950.937_7.04.wav_ASR	the race maybe assemptic if you will and slow down pretty rapidly after a year or a half
65-2_958.775_1.9.wav_ASR	you never never stop recovering
65-2_961.454_7.72.wav_ASR	and the eighteen eighty four incident i had a a dead spot with no feeling above the left head
65-2_970.136_2.65.wav_ASR	and there's just something that experienced
65-2_972.842_1.73.wav_ASR	and there was like a bunch of them
65-2_974.655_0.98.wav_ASR	you know no big deal
65-2_975.956_3.16.wav_ASR	to shake a pen in there and oh wouldn't couldn't write
65-2_979.96_1.4.wav_ASR	oh no big deal
65-2_981.865_4.86.wav_ASR	and then it was probably be five years ago or maybe twenty twenty
65-2_987.413_0.4.wav_ASR	thank you
65-2_987.879_0.74.wav_ASR	there's oh no
65-2_989.309_5.7.wav_ASR	twenty five years after the eighty four incident i was in the in the bedroom putting my socks on one morning
65-2_996.424_4.47.wav_ASR	and i had feeling in the spot that had no feeling for twenty five years
65-2_1002.063_12.36.wav_ASR	so what i'm telling firstnamea is that the recovery may slowly recover but but still slow down significantly
65-2_1014.632_2.9.wav_ASR	but still you're never stop recovering
65-2_1017.689_1.16.wav_ASR	you just don't stop recovering
65-2_1019.52_6.059.wav_ASR	yeah i'm done practicing
65-2_1068.805_3.42.wav_ASR	yes yeah it's not right
65-2_1072.242_7.48.wav_ASR	it's it's time time is the best you're best ally and in those kinds of cases
65-2_1080.467_7.98.wav_ASR	because you you the feeling that you don't have it will lessen and it less and important
65-2_1088.535_2.52.wav_ASR	and and you'll notice one day
65-2_1091.749_2.26.wav_ASR	crash i i i i have feeling there that i didn't have before
65-2_1094.551_1.56.wav_ASR	actually it will happen
65-2_1096.384_0.98.wav_ASR	you will explain it
65-2_1108.416_2.63.wav_ASR	actually didn't know

65-2_1281.66_2.44.wav_ASR	umbrella umbrella
65-2_1284.355_0.44.wav_ASR	it was to be
65-2_1284.946_0.71.wav_ASR	that's why
65-2_1285.671_4.64.wav_ASR	and and we i just i home around
65-2_1290.557_3.4.wav_ASR	well i i i ran her that that dance
65-2_1294.796_2.28.wav_ASR	and that's where we started dating
65-2_1297.1_3.94.wav_ASR	and and oh it was probably three years or so
65-2_1301.09_1.27.wav_ASR	they stayed in the room about three years or so
65-2_1303.312_4.59.wav_ASR	and after about four years something's gone on there
65-2_1307.917_1.44.wav_ASR	and i'd get more serious about this
65-2_1310.334_6.28.wav_ASR	so it's just i i i use her of of picking me up at a school dance
65-2_1317.648_2.02.wav_ASR	that's where we were first met and she picked me up at the door
65-2_1359.514_5.59.wav_ASR	young a young boy looks like a a grasshopper's had a soccer
65-2_1365.124_0.54.wav_ASR	he's kicking it
65-2_1366.388_2.61.wav_ASR	he he ends up going through the house window
65-2_1369.723_9.4.wav_ASR	generally on a couch in the window sitting right by where the soccer ball comes through and knocks a lamp down and surprises him
65-2_1379.989_6.19.wav_ASR	and then he he he gets the ball stays by the window window trying to find out what went on
65-2_1402.182_12.63.wav_ASR	and the beginning this this mother it appears as has had an umbrella and wanted to give it to her son before he goes off to school or goes somewhere
65-2_1415.551_2.24.wav_ASR	and and he says
65-2_1418.288_0.93.wav_ASR	he says no and says
65-2_1419.62_0.77.wav_ASR	oh no mommy
65-2_1421.306_1.08.wav_ASR	and then then leave
65-2_1422.451_2.41.wav_ASR	and then in the middle and it started raining on him
65-2_1425.438_1.43.wav_ASR	and then rain heavy on him
65-2_1426.933_7.19.wav_ASR	and then he goes back home just soaked in the bone as with mother kind of drowning
65-2_1434.453_6.25.wav_ASR	and then the last the end of the story was he learned his lesson and has the umbrella with him is walking in the rain
65-2_1455.01_13.73.wav_ASR	the way this started was that it looks like that there's a a a tree with a dog at the base of the tree a a a male at the first tree
65-2_1469.12_2.18.wav_ASR	the dog's barking at this guy
65-2_1471.974_7.79.wav_ASR	and on the tree limb there's a tricycle below this cat
65-2_1480.206_6.04.wav_ASR	and it would appear that a cat climbed up the tree
65-2_1487.152_3.15.wav_ASR	the the little girl's cat climbed up the tree and got stuck up there
65-2_1491.016_10.21.wav_ASR	they they by mail a man was either being chased up the tree by the dog or climb the tree to help the get the cat
65-2_1501.878_3.4.wav_ASR	there's also a firetruck and a fire engine
65-2_1506.838_1.32.wav_ASR	the fair are carrying a ladder
65-2_1508.684_7.57.wav_ASR	and it looks like the the the ladder is being used by the firemen to rescue either the the the man or the cat or both
65-2_1517.004_11.24.wav_ASR	and a sonbird is over in the a a remote tree limb just sitting away just observing the the old old story
65-2_1528.296_3.07.wav_ASR	okay
65-2_1754.983_9.4.wav_ASR	and cinderella was a the daughter of a a king who's
65-2_1764.522_2.45.wav_ASR	her mother had passed away
65-2_1767.818_1.36.wav_ASR	and her father remarried
65-2_1769.925_8.29.wav_ASR	and the stepmother had two two daughters who were mean mean daughters
65-2_1778.914_21.3.wav_ASR	and as they after they were married the father and mother and stepmother put cinderella to work around the place where around the stepsisters were were did did did basically nothing
65-2_1801.139_8.38.wav_ASR	and so so cinderella spent her time working cleaning polishing that kind of stuff around the house
65-2_1810.138_10.22.wav_ASR	and and in the kingdom there was a a a prince who was not married
65-2_1821.196_18.68.wav_ASR	an investigator to the king suggested a a a a ball be held with the the exercises exercise program of introduction or get introducing the his son to the the elementary young ladies in the kingdom
65-2_1840.902_3.19.wav_ASR	so the word is put out about the ball coming up
65-2_1844.858_6.3.wav_ASR	and cinderella was really happy about the ball coming coming coming up as were the stepsisters
65-2_1851.712_16.43.wav_ASR	and so the the the farm animals i mean birds mice and made a a beautiful dress for cinderella for the ball
65-2_1868.918_10.26.wav_ASR	and and then at the last minute the stepmother told cinderella she was not going to the ball
65-2_1879.2_8.54.wav_ASR	and and the stepdaughter's were really really really really really really mean to her
65-2_1888.574_2.81.wav_ASR	and so so the stepdaughter went to the ball
65-2_1892.097_14.38.wav_ASR	and but in the meantime well before the ball before the ball cinderella's fairy godmother showed up and and said that well
65-2_1906.5_5.6.wav_ASR	and so it it made for her a just a lovely gown
65-2_1912.863_16.73.wav_ASR	and they turned a pumpkin into a coach pulled by by by mice i believe that were that ended up turning into horses
65-2_1930.594_4.29.wav_ASR	and and so then she went to the ball
65-2_1935.637_15.69.wav_ASR	and the prince was quite delighted with the stepdaughters and and everyone everyone around there and then only hit it off of cinderella
65-2_1951.795_2.29.wav_ASR	and he's spending the night dancing with the cinderella
65-2_1954.409_7.13.wav_ASR	the her godmother told cinderella that that you hafta be home home by midnight because this this all the end at midnight
65-2_1962.363_5.08.wav_ASR	and so the the the the the prince and cinderella were dancing at midnight
65-2_1967.926_1.87.wav_ASR	and then then cinderella
65-2_1970.219_0.31.wav_ASR	oh no
65-2_1970.547_6.69.wav_ASR	and runs runs one glass slipper behind the place leaving a glass slipper one glass slipper behind
65-2_1978.161_9.82.wav_ASR	and and as she's being driven back home the the coach turned back into a pumpkin
65-2_1988.0_2.49.wav_ASR	and the the horse turned back into the mice
65-2_1990.617_5.26.wav_ASR	and the the footman and back in the horse and are are their dog
65-2_1996.13_0.56.wav_ASR	umbrella
65-2_1997.231_3.15.wav_ASR	and then so but still that that it was over
65-2_2000.401_10.91.wav_ASR	and and then after the ball the the prince decided that there was only this cinderella he was interested in
65-2_2012.653_3.04.wav_ASR	but nobody knew who cinderella was and could not find her
65-2_2016.419_10.69.wav_ASR	and so he he put his advice out to the task of trying to locate cinderella with the glass slipper that that she left behind
65-2_2027.888_3.08.wav_ASR	and came to cinderella's house
65-2_2031.017_3.76.wav_ASR	the the slipper did not fit the the stepsisters
65-2_2035.46_4.69.wav_ASR	and then but but turn out it did fit the cinderella
65-2_2041.079_9.609.wav_ASR	and so so it ended up being that that cinderella and the prince got together and were married and lived happily ever
65-2_2063.239_2.41.wav_ASR	you have two slices of bread
65-2_2066.402_6.391.wav_ASR	they hadta agree on a peanut butter and jelly and have a knife or or a spoon

65-2_2080.572_5.141.wav_ASR	and then you spread the jelly on the other piece of bread
65-2_2086.377_2.24.wav_ASR	and then you put the pieces of bread together

tcu07a_312.787_1.43.wav_ASR	you know i find that
tcu07a_314.811_3.77.wav_ASR	it seems like every time i a little bit more a little bit more you know
tcu07a_318.6_0.53.wav_ASR	so
tcu07a_320.674_0.42.wav_ASR	yeah
tcu07a_322.153_0.55.wav_ASR	yeah

UCL02a_18.68_2.04.wav_ASR	what it could be today oh with the ends yeah
UCL02a_25.837_2.86.wav_ASR	my speech and it's talking today
UCL02a_31.699_1.62.wav_ASR	thank you
UCL02a_34.593_2.69.wav_ASR	well maybe you don't know
UCL02a_37.33_2.09.wav_ASR	so sometimes he's busy this morning or something and he's busy
UCL02a_39.439_0.94.wav_ASR	thank you very much
UCL02a_40.4_0.93.wav_ASR	it's beautiful isn't it today
UCL02a_43.429_1.1.wav_ASR	speaking you come back good
UCL02a_44.544_1.86.wav_ASR	sometimes i can and talk
UCL02a_47.789_2.6.wav_ASR	what's happening about me now
UCL02a_50.411_1.47.wav_ASR	can't
UCL02a_53.073_3.41.wav_ASR	you know seeing me a big problem with me sometimes suddenly one word is just gone
UCL02a_56.5_1.63.wav_ASR	you know that
UCL02a_58.449_1.89.wav_ASR	because it's took me out there now i can't remember
UCL02a_61.489_4.3.wav_ASR	one two weeks i think i can hear about everything
UCL02a_66.983_3.54.wav_ASR	oh i can hear everything
UCL02a_70.775_5.62.wav_ASR	and then suddenly it it just disappears from me now
UCL02a_77.532_0.76.wav_ASR	it's hard to tell
UCL02a_78.308_2.25.wav_ASR	sometimes suddenly one day he come be perfect
UCL02a_81.517_1.77.wav_ASR	well not perfect but it is decent
UCL02a_83.309_5.47.wav_ASR	and sometimes it's i just can't hear you know
UCL02a_88.8_1.82.wav_ASR	that's a difficult thing to put in with the speech
UCL02a_92.492_4.69.wav_ASR	and then i told her sometimes it's okay
UCL02a_97.24_3.13.wav_ASR	and then of course one word is just disappointing for me as well
UCL02a_100.812_1.34.wav_ASR	so i went to the
UCL02a_102.173_0.54.wav_ASR	that's okay
UCL02a_103.893_3.39.wav_ASR	and then suddenly one word is beautiful for speaking to to speak everybody
UCL02a_107.33_0.65.wav_ASR	it's good for me
UCL02a_108.7_2.11.wav_ASR	and then suddenly just make me so tired
UCL02a_111.006_1.62.wav_ASR	well but then i just kinda here
UCL02a_112.82_1.55.wav_ASR	it's difficult to tell you know
UCL02a_115.317_8.88.wav_ASR	yeah i wanna take about
UCL02a_124.218_1.15.wav_ASR	so many things about me were well
UCL02a_125.597_8.35.wav_ASR	but i try many times about my speech to everybody
UCL02a_134.03_3.34.wav_ASR	sometimes it's brilliant
UCL02a_137.419_4.91.wav_ASR	when people are talking to me and then i guess that what they're talking to me is
UCL02a_142.345_3.14.wav_ASR	and i think maybe one little word is it's disappeared from me now
UCL02a_146.052_0.98.wav_ASR	one word is gone
UCL02a_147.699_2.65.wav_ASR	and then suddenly she's just terrible when i can't hear everything
UCL02a_151.038_4.42.wav_ASR	the stroke is hard for me
UCL02a_155.949_12.23.wav_ASR	sometimes the bad thing is sometimes where you you i can't do anything for me
UCL02a_168.2_1.91.wav_ASR	that's that's big and making feeling good
UCL02a_171.11_1.02.wav_ASR	it's very difficult for me
UCL02a_172.344_1.12.wav_ASR	they're very difficult sometimes
UCL02a_173.565_1.16.wav_ASR	and then when he was ready
UCL02a_175.216_2.16.wav_ASR	you can't speak to me
UCL02a_177.398_0.78.wav_ASR	he's happy to me
UCL02a_178.199_1.64.wav_ASR	and that's very different from something like that
UCL02a_180.635_5.7.wav_ASR	and you get refreshing refreshing
UCL02a_186.35_0.66.wav_ASR	and i'm saying that yeah
UCL02a_187.33_0.32.wav_ASR	oh yeah
UCL02a_188.404_3.4.wav_ASR	well that can be terrible sometimes
UCL02a_192.01_4.9.wav_ASR	sometimes
UCL02a_198.705_2.08.wav_ASR	divided for me about what i'm gonna do about speech as well
UCL02a_200.83_1.55.wav_ASR	as long as i'm no reading books
UCL02a_202.4_2.79.wav_ASR	so i useta read a lot of things you know before i did my stroke
UCL02a_205.21_1.04.wav_ASR	but i read a lot of books
UCL02a_206.693_3.1.wav_ASR	now it's difficult for me as when i speaking about my books to me
UCL02a_210.781_7.56.wav_ASR	and the awful thing for me is i'm reading some of my books about two pages and then i can't remember what i'm talking about
UCL02a_218.619_3.13.wav_ASR	the half of the pages are reading about and then suddenly
UCL02a_222.2_2.17.wav_ASR	yes that's pretty good but i'm reading about that
UCL02a_224.65_1.38.wav_ASR	and then suddenly one brain helps him
UCL02a_226.05_0.43.wav_ASR	it's just gone
UCL02a_226.69_0.88.wav_ASR	it's terrible as well
UCL02a_228.468_4.2.wav_ASR	so many times when i'm reading again and i can't know what i'm talking about the time before
UCL02a_232.729_1.01.wav_ASR	but it's terrible you know
UCL02a_234.485_8.7.wav_ASR	yeah yeah that's how we're working films and things like that for me as well
UCL02a_243.916_13.13.wav_ASR	well watching films or devi devi d v d videos sometimes i hafta watch everything to subtitutes
UCL02a_258.261_9.22.wav_ASR	that's hasta be as well like subtitutes and i the the next day again or something like that
UCL02a_268.09_0.94.wav_ASR	so the things are okay
UCL02a_269.046_0.67.wav_ASR	that's quite good
UCL02a_270.468_3.7.wav_ASR	because i can't what they're talking about without a phone
UCL02a_274.691_5.27.wav_ASR	slippers are really good for me important for my well
UCL02a_282.717_3.23.wav_ASR	and then of course what happened to me with my stroke is well
UCL02a_285.97_2.58.wav_ASR	of course you know you did a lot with classical music
UCL02a_288.565_1.94.wav_ASR	that was the concert i
UCL02a_292.355_5.18.wav_ASR	that's the all the classic music classical music plays
UCL02a_297.553_2.03.wav_ASR	so i was living up in germany and Spain and things like that
UCL02a_299.599_4.57.wav_ASR	but that's one of the things i was doing as the manager of all the courses with me
UCL02a_305.791_4.38.wav_ASR	at least my my classical music is there thank you
UCL02a_311.267_2.23.wav_ASR	but strange as it may seem they happened to me
UCL02a_314.212_3.28.wav_ASR	and i can hear the words perfectly about
UCL02a_317.508_1.67.wav_ASR	all of a sudden the music is that
UCL02a_319.2_1.21.wav_ASR	can you hear everything perfectly
UCL02a_320.824_0.96.wav_ASR	then sometime
UCL02a_322.053_0.66.wav_ASR	yeah it's that
UCL02a_323.079_2.0.wav_ASR	well i know that music
UCL02a_325.1_0.75.wav_ASR	it can hear it's well
UCL02a_326.28_0.58.wav_ASR	but i can't say it
UCL02a_327.06_3.92.wav_ASR	it's a little bit like you know so it's been a bit of a battle over and that that
UCL02a_331.0_0.95.wav_ASR	can you see what that
UCL02a_332.315_0.63.wav_ASR	and then suddenly
UCL02a_333.511_1.24.wav_ASR	oh yeah was the that big
UCL02a_334.876_1.23.wav_ASR	it was the pancake
UCL02a_336.218_1.82.wav_ASR	that's one word it's just gone for me
UCL02a_339.028_2.35.wav_ASR	useta get a party but
UCL02a_341.4_0.32.wav_ASR	thank you
UCL02a_341.803_0.93.wav_ASR	and that's what it was my life
UCL02a_342.829_1.91.wav_ASR	you know i can remember the word up here is that
UCL02a_344.964_0.93.wav_ASR	can't hear you all of it
UCL02a_347.417_4.47.wav_ASR	but the classical music as well
UCL02a_351.907_3.12.wav_ASR	oh i mean thanks my music there as well as you know
UCL02a_355.5_1.15.wav_ASR	but saying just now
UCL02a_357.482_1.78.wav_ASR	and reading the books can be difficult for me
UCL02a_360.193_2.99.wav_ASR	the films i need the subtitles
UCL02a_363.263_3.04.wav_ASR	but then with the music it's brilliant thanks god i mean you know
UCL02a_367.126_5.98.wav_ASR	many things happened with me in my face yeah and things like that a couple of people was well

UCL02a_376.48_0.38.wav_ASR	thank you
UCL02a_377.882_5.1.wav_ASR	or i don't know
UCL02a_383.006_1.68.wav_ASR	slipper slippers as well you know

UCL02a_388.125_1.06.wav_ASR	yes but it
UCL02a_394.094_1.97.wav_ASR	that me on the actual day that happened to me yeah
UCL02a_397.44_1.06.wav_ASR	what happened to you
UCL02a_399.855_1.57.wav_ASR	well that was in the old
UCL02a_402.334_3.75.wav_ASR	that's the is the twenty year the fifty yeah
UCL02a_407.543_0.84.wav_ASR	twenty five
UCL02a_408.4_1.08.wav_ASR	yeah it's making sense to me
UCL02a_409.58_2.56.wav_ASR	there's the orange four years ago
UCL02a_414.5_2.34.wav_ASR	yeah especially what i really remember is it was very strange
UCL02a_416.862_0.77.wav_ASR	he was in the evening
UCL02a_417.65_1.01.wav_ASR	and i got to work
UCL02a_419.58_2.06.wav_ASR	and it's about nine thirty in the morning
UCL02a_422.308_1.74.wav_ASR	of course it's in the tube
UCL02a_424.068_1.71.wav_ASR	but then i'm gonna catch my bus
UCL02a_427.382_1.25.wav_ASR	and they got there to work
UCL02a_429.05_1.69.wav_ASR	and i remember it was really strange
UCL02a_432.378_3.07.wav_ASR	and i was gonna go on to my computer
UCL02a_436.506_0.97.wav_ASR	and then suddenly
UCL02a_437.5_2.4.wav_ASR	yeah it's just i'm switching my computer to switch it on
UCL02a_440.439_4.99.wav_ASR	and i couldn't use my computer
UCL02a_445.929_3.87.wav_ASR	was my my my my code you know you're writing things
UCL02a_450.603_0.68.wav_ASR	come on
UCL02a_451.3_1.04.wav_ASR	come on
UCL02a_452.404_0.36.wav_ASR	so
UCL02a_454.288_1.27.wav_ASR	the i saw my couple
UCL02a_455.628_0.46.wav_ASR	and i said
UCL02a_456.246_7.3.wav_ASR	well i mean i can't remember how to use my computer and things like that
UCL02a_464.158_1.26.wav_ASR	and then she suddenly noticed
UCL02a_465.465_2.41.wav_ASR	and she said to me i wasn't to bit strange to me as well
UCL02a_468.953_0.57.wav_ASR	as the mother says
UCL02a_470.161_1.38.wav_ASR	okay and that's it
UCL02a_471.8_0.6.wav_ASR	when i thought
UCL02a_474.207_0.79.wav_ASR	it was fine for me
UCL02a_475.017_1.76.wav_ASR	and walking around and things like that you know
UCL02a_476.8_2.11.wav_ASR	it's still my brain is
UCL02a_480.117_4.99.wav_ASR	my computer was and going downstairs and things like that and that
UCL02a_485.795_3.66.wav_ASR	and suddenly some friends were talking to me and they were taking me
UCL02a_489.477_2.9.wav_ASR	and i couldn't what they were talking to me
UCL02a_494.892_2.06.wav_ASR	and then a friend of mine firstnamel and then she said
UCL02a_497.05_1.56.wav_ASR	oh yeah i want to get you sort of as well
UCL02a_499.0_1.51.wav_ASR	and she called
UCL02a_501.025_2.43.wav_ASR	yeah but nine o'clock in the morning
UCL02a_503.787_2.13.wav_ASR	we'll take you up to the hospital
UCL02a_507.338_1.89.wav_ASR	and i sat there for a couple of times as well
UCL02a_509.25_2.01.wav_ASR	and then they cutting for me for that
UCL02a_512.02_0.421.wav_ASR	and i said
UCL02a_512.456_1.29.wav_ASR	and one guy's taking me
UCL02a_513.77_1.31.wav_ASR	and there's some other people and
UCL02a_516.39_1.49.wav_ASR	then you know he was
UCL02a_517.899_1.26.wav_ASR	and then i couldn't speak to anyone
UCL02a_519.178_1.81.wav_ASR	yeah it's a bit of umbrella umbrella
UCL02a_522.583_7.091.wav_ASR	in hospital they all sort of scathing things and was the like that and things to me
UCL02a_530.449_1.74.wav_ASR	and i couldn't speak
UCL02a_533.17_0.79.wav_ASR	and i couldn't speak
UCL02a_534.844_2.64.wav_ASR	when people were talking to me i couldn't what they were talking to me
UCL02a_537.5_1.32.wav_ASR	occasionally one word yes
UCL02a_539.744_1.17.wav_ASR	nothing was gone
UCL02a_542.169_5.25.wav_ASR	yeah it was here
UCL02a_547.468_1.91.wav_ASR	but i remember those are the last two years ago
UCL02a_549.43_5.87.wav_ASR	so then yeah it north north north northeast the first day as well
UCL02a_555.32_1.53.wav_ASR	and then i said after that was about
UCL02a_557.638_2.43.wav_ASR	there's a five or six days hours
UCL02a_560.666_2.74.wav_ASR	and they move me from there down here to ucl yeah
UCL02a_564.353_1.74.wav_ASR	we're on top of the tree
UCL02a_568.078_5.12.wav_ASR	and and that was it
UCL02a_573.219_1.35.wav_ASR	oh yeah i mean you know
UCL02a_575.827_0.89.wav_ASR	remember after that
UCL02a_576.741_1.01.wav_ASR	there's about five hours
UCL02a_577.773_1.11.wav_ASR	and that's is big
UCL02a_579.236_0.55.wav_ASR	then they're coming up
UCL02a_579.81_3.71.wav_ASR	it was quite in the evening as well
UCL02a_584.84_3.59.wav_ASR	and people were on the doctors and trying to write for me as well
UCL02a_588.451_4.45.wav_ASR	and it could be that my speech was even worse that very evening time as well
UCL02a_593.524_2.64.wav_ASR	and the next day is well i just couldn't speak to everybody
UCL02a_597.058_3.09.wav_ASR	and mean all the hospitals were there and looking at me and other people
UCL02a_600.25_1.04.wav_ASR	and i couldn't
UCL02a_602.917_2.26.wav_ASR	three i remember now
UCL02a_605.262_2.6.wav_ASR	the first the first day
UCL02a_608.048_0.74.wav_ASR	so that's that
UCL02a_608.959_0.82.wav_ASR	he was terrible
UCL02a_609.799_0.88.wav_ASR	and i couldn't speak at all
UCL02a_610.7_0.75.wav_ASR	oh people were looking at me
UCL02a_611.467_0.48.wav_ASR	and i was like
UCL02a_613.201_2.54.wav_ASR	when people were talking to me
UCL02a_615.795_4.6.wav_ASR	and i couldn't when they hadta talk to me i couldn't speak to anything
UCL02a_620.505_0.55.wav_ASR	stethoscope
UCL02a_621.961_1.52.wav_ASR	yeah there's writing down
UCL02a_624.359_1.26.wav_ASR	so they're saying that
UCL02a_625.666_1.39.wav_ASR	and i couldn't speak anything as well
UCL02a_628.52_4.16.wav_ASR	that's the worst thing for about you but it changes about three or four weeks
UCL02a_632.699_1.28.wav_ASR	and remember as
UCL02a_634.0_2.21.wav_ASR	well everybody's dancing around that that that
UCL02a_637.869_2.91.wav_ASR	and then after that as well
UCL02a_640.8_0.48.wav_ASR	yes
UCL02a_641.3_2.15.wav_ASR	so mayanmar place him here
UCL02a_644.103_1.81.wav_ASR	and then this play just the recording from here
UCL02a_646.0_0.38.wav_ASR	slipper
UCL02a_646.4_5.93.wav_ASR	the queen queen queen
UCL02a_652.975_4.0.wav_ASR	the university of maryland you know
UCL02a_657.478_1.21.wav_ASR	as far as two weeks or so
UCL02a_659.32_1.48.wav_ASR	and they test me and don't do that
UCL02a_661.705_2.51.wav_ASR	so that's i mean it's not very nice today
UCL02a_664.318_1.87.wav_ASR	that's the first day they have me on the first road yeah
UCL02a_675.556_1.58.wav_ASR	that's like getting any better yeah
UCL02a_677.863_3.8.wav_ASR	it's strange
UCL02a_681.681_3.38.wav_ASR	sposta be the next thing for me i suppose because two weeks after
UCL02a_685.08_1.4.wav_ASR	oh the first first we useta
UCL02a_686.5_1.06.wav_ASR	oh thank you
UCL02a_687.622_3.32.wav_ASR	and then two eight the new university
UCL02a_691.037_1.37.wav_ASR	oh i can't be the first word as well
UCL02a_693.677_2.17.wav_ASR	remember there was the first one about two weeks
UCL02a_695.871_6.85.wav_ASR	and then there's some people were testing me up for video
UCL02a_704.304_2.18.wav_ASR	and somebody was the doctor
UCL02a_706.5_3.48.wav_ASR	there's lots of tests and things like that and va
UCL02a_712.938_1.25.wav_ASR	and she's test me
UCL02a_714.208_1.77.wav_ASR	and you know these photographs of me
UCL02a_716.0_3.65.wav_ASR	and oh these cats
UCL02a_719.666_1.46.wav_ASR	the books and things like that
UCL02a_721.149_1.73.wav_ASR	and what's this and some other things for me
UCL02a_723.85_4.47.wav_ASR	and and sometimes i couldn't what she was talking about
UCL02a_728.336_1.86.wav_ASR	and he's just to see you like the photo things
UCL02a_730.212_3.77.wav_ASR	there's a dog and you know square things and that kind of thing
UCL02a_738.114_2.95.wav_ASR	then after that about two weeks another place
UCL02a_741.126_4.6.wav_ASR	and then that was called the stroke community people as well
UCL02a_747.398_2.78.wav_ASR	and the other thing was then one group of people helping out
UCL02a_750.539_5.96.wav_ASR	helping people for writing some words and me as well
UCL02a_757.561_3.75.wav_ASR	help me some words
UCL02a_761.331_3.15.wav_ASR	you know it's in monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday
UCL02a_764.5_1.42.wav_ASR	the first day i couldn't tell me
UCL02a_766.211_2.02.wav_ASR	he's in monday tuesday and wednesday
UCL02a_768.626_0.55.wav_ASR	three i could remember
UCL02a_769.252_0.9.wav_ASR	so it monday to there
UCL02a_770.176_1.63.wav_ASR	they couldn't speak the word
UCL02a_772.961_6.7.wav_ASR	it's the first day second word third first day second second third four five six
UCL02a_779.679_0.83.wav_ASR	and then i couldn't
UCL02a_781.953_1.63.wav_ASR	well i still have problems like that now
UCL02a_783.712_1.47.wav_ASR	is one two three four five six seven eight
UCL02a_785.2_1.08.wav_ASR	peanut butter and jelly
UCL02a_786.37_3.78.wav_ASR	but the first time i was told me he's i couldn't speak up
UCL02a_790.171_3.41.wav_ASR	you know what day is
UCL02a_793.6_0.79.wav_ASR	what am i
UCL02a_795.524_1.21.wav_ASR	well you were my going
UCL02a_796.901_1.38.wav_ASR	and i couldn't write what things are again
UCL02a_799.104_2.08.wav_ASR	that's difficult for me as well you know
UCL02a_801.24_3.72.wav_ASR	there were some people i suppose for for about
UCL02a_806.4_3.15.wav_ASR	it's about six years it's about six months she was there
UCL02a_810.46_2.21.wav_ASR	every week for me some lady was taking me
UCL02a_812.693_6.05.wav_ASR	and you know reaching some words and helping out that that
UCL02a_818.791_1.44.wav_ASR	sposta be about two weeks
UCL02a_821.718_4.68.wav_ASR	and then after that i was at sea
UCL02a_826.419_1.74.wav_ASR	there were three weeks and then
UCL02a_828.767_2.69.wav_ASR	oh i might six weeks or nine weeks yeah
UCL02a_832.093_7.38.wav_ASR	and then within a few minutes and then with you at the ucla aphasia company
UCL02a_840.063_1.49.wav_ASR	that was you the first test as well
UCL02a_841.662_2.74.wav_ASR	sposta be
UCL02a_845.928_4.83.wav_ASR	thank you for me you know with the stroke and the surgery recently i can walk around
UCL02a_850.827_3.82.wav_ASR	and then those are a big problem for me because you know and things like that
UCL02a_854.716_0.61.wav_ASR	that's okay
UCL02a_856.337_3.78.wav_ASR	you know i'm by the bus and the tube and everything like that
UCL02a_860.14_0.69.wav_ASR	but it's funny
UCL02a_861.098_3.8.wav_ASR	come come pancake you know about in the shoe by myself
UCL02a_865.175_1.64.wav_ASR	and not being able to help people as well
UCL02a_867.837_2.54.wav_ASR	that's a good word for me
UCL02a_870.4_4.58.wav_ASR	yeah i think it was strange you know other people that were with the aphasia
UCL02a_875.2_1.96.wav_ASR	if you're by yourself a picnic
UCL02a_877.224_0.68.wav_ASR	he's gonna have
UCL02a_878.342_1.19.wav_ASR	and it's gonna happen
UCL02a_881.28_2.41.wav_ASR	can't be word for me sometimes
UCL02a_883.763_1.66.wav_ASR	but i'm not much better now
UCL02a_885.443_1.45.wav_ASR	but it can be terrible you know
UCL02a_887.833_4.93.wav_ASR	and i can't speak what i'm talking about now to other people you know
UCL02a_893.03_5.1.wav_ASR	but sposta after that he's better for me now
UCL02a_898.696_6.84.wav_ASR	but yeah i mean physically you walking around
UCL02a_905.56_0.96.wav_ASR	but it's fine for me
UCL02a_907.365_2.52.wav_ASR	but it's just you know it's my own brain thing as well
UCL02a_909.992_0.51.wav_ASR	oh that's good
UCL02a_911.188_1.79.wav_ASR	so make sense to you yeah
UCL02a_940.576_0.67.wav_ASR	see you in a minute
UCL02a_941.493_0.61.wav_ASR	just say it again
UCL02a_942.392_1.14.wav_ASR	have to say it again
UCL02a_948.585_0.9.wav_ASR	wasn't a little kid
UCL02a_955.002_2.69.wav_ASR	well i'm a kid or one of us kid he says
UCL02a_966.107_3.03.wav_ASR	then then what really happened to me yeah
UCL02a_971.144_7.25.wav_ASR	it's making any sense to you but what what what what was happening to me as a kid or yeah
UCL02a_978.444_0.75.wav_ASR	oh alright yeah
UCL02a_979.633_2.56.wav_ASR	two but me speaking the language and things like that or not
UCL02a_986.138_3.38.wav_ASR	yeah and everything what it's crazy strange or the little days as well
UCL02a_989.538_1.6.wav_ASR	well you know i'm fifty eight
UCL02a_992.535_2.48.wav_ASR	but i remember as a kid i was lucky when i was kid
UCL02a_995.033_0.71.wav_ASR	it's strange as well
UCL02a_995.761_5.8.wav_ASR	mean i was about ten ten to thirteen years as a kid
UCL02a_1002.376_7.93.wav_ASR	and i was living in in naples early as a kid
UCL02a_1010.322_6.55.wav_ASR	and i was boarding school in england as well
UCL02a_1017.003_0.78.wav_ASR	how'd you back there
UCL02a_1018.974_1.8.wav_ASR	but it's strange you took about that thing's happiness as well
UCL02a_1020.913_2.78.wav_ASR	but i remember that was
UCL02a_1024.459_3.88.wav_ASR	they always lived in germany as well about you know five years as well but then back to england
UCL02a_1029.03_3.799.wav_ASR	and then after it's back to entirely as well
UCL02a_1033.867_3.061.wav_ASR	and it's strange that it's strange the kind of days
UCL02a_1038.126_1.02.wav_ASR	it was wonderful
UCL02a_1039.807_0.56.wav_ASR	as it key
UCL02a_1040.387_2.99.wav_ASR	we lived in naples just outside of naples
UCL02a_1044.069_3.01.wav_ASR	we had a
UCL02a_1047.13_2.44.wav_ASR	from what was the difference she could see
UCL02a_1053.355_0.79.wav_ASR	vegas
UCL02a_1054.307_0.36.wav_ASR	okay
UCL02a_1055.824_2.03.wav_ASR	vl ul sl
UCL02a_1058.851_0.67.wav_ASR	you know that thing
UCL02a_1060.129_0.32.wav_ASR	umbrella
UCL02a_1061.36_1.67.wav_ASR	vegas
UCL02a_1063.289_0.95.wav_ASR	it costs me the word
UCL02a_1064.257_1.25.wav_ASR	you know the big ball
UCL02a_1066.615_3.45.wav_ASR	and i don't know about as well
UCL02a_1070.089_2.69.wav_ASR	it was up to one of them being a kid up there
UCL02a_1072.85_4.61.wav_ASR	okay that was good as well we live not far way down from the beach

UCL02a_1101.086_0.74.wav_ASR	oh that's you love me
UCL02a_1102.743_1.24.wav_ASR	that was wonderful for me
UCL02a_1104.0_0.87.wav_ASR	oh i really was lucky
UCL02a_1105.801_5.43.wav_ASR	and many times as well i remember it was amazing
UCL02a_1111.66_5.83.wav_ASR	because i remember were near neaples where we lived in the other part of the
UCL02a_1119.401_0.9.wav_ASR	they were talking
UCL02a_1122.722_0.47.wav_ASR	sort it
UCL02a_1123.837_4.04.wav_ASR	that lovely place where the the windows the windows there
UCL02a_1129.177_1.12.wav_ASR	popa poppa
UCL02a_1130.398_0.47.wav_ASR	he said he could
UCL02a_1131.367_2.59.wav_ASR	oh boy and there's wonderful that's many times as well
UCL02a_1134.864_5.68.wav_ASR	another one there too called
UCL02a_1140.562_0.67.wav_ASR	and the word is well
UCL02a_1141.249_0.33.wav_ASR	it's terrible
UCL02a_1141.6_0.78.wav_ASR	laughing
UCL02a_1142.4_2.07.wav_ASR	well that's beautiful as well and going up there
UCL02a_1146.5_0.73.wav_ASR	it was beautiful
UCL02a_1147.45_3.91.wav_ASR	or i don't even if it's something was really good to me now it was a good and nice feeling
UCL02a_1151.961_1.02.wav_ASR	little bit feeling yeah
UCL02a_1153.0_1.95.wav_ASR	the the that was really nice to me
UCL02a_1155.978_1.45.wav_ASR	but i don't even think he's well but the tree
UCL02a_1157.451_2.07.wav_ASR	and mean individual was unhappy as well
UCL02a_1159.847_0.73.wav_ASR	he's he's well
UCL02a_1160.596_0.44.wav_ASR	yes i remember
UCL02a_1161.374_2.5.wav_ASR	yeah's ten to about thirteen years old
UCL02a_1164.139_2.9.wav_ASR	then my brain hadta go back to engineering
UCL02a_1168.309_0.98.wav_ASR	still the school
UCL02a_1169.391_6.21.wav_ASR	and then when i finished going off to university at king's here after
UCL02a_1179.707_0.74.wav_ASR	so yes nice
UCL02a_1180.518_1.69.wav_ASR	ten years is about ten weeks
UCL02a_1183.37_5.06.wav_ASR	ten is about ten years again just after that
UCL02a_1188.696_3.17.wav_ASR	so nineteen eighty yeah not be six
UCL02a_1192.48_1.17.wav_ASR	one found
UCL02a_1194.89_3.13.wav_ASR	so it was about fifty years as well
UCL02a_1198.222_5.16.wav_ASR	well i i found out where the old house was staying in the suburbs
UCL02a_1203.403_7.26.wav_ASR	there's a little tiny village outside the very top part
UCL02a_1210.851_1.2.wav_ASR	and i found him where he was

UCL02a_1221.964_0.68.wav_ASR	they're tall
UCL02a_1223.734_3.25.wav_ASR	yes exactly
UCL02a_1227.0_0.98.wav_ASR	it's quite strange to watch
UCL02a_1228.41_4.07.wav_ASR	there's a little thing be running as well but puddles and things
UCL02a_1232.5_1.32.wav_ASR	there's terrible
UCL02a_1234.704_0.61.wav_ASR	it was lovely
UCL02a_1235.413_0.57.wav_ASR	what's the word
UCL02a_1236.0_0.63.wav_ASR	he's a little yeah
UCL02a_1236.684_1.21.wav_ASR	it was nice as well yeah
UCL02a_1286.807_7.87.wav_ASR	and i just want to a writing or something like that yeah
UCL02a_1294.873_1.09.wav_ASR	don't wanna speak to me now
UCL02a_1305.334_0.85.wav_ASR	okay alright good morning
UCL02a_1306.2_3.5.wav_ASR	as a young kid a little young young kid
UCL02a_1309.751_1.54.wav_ASR	he's playing with his football
UCL02a_1311.308_7.67.wav_ASR	he's out in the garden garden yeah the garden
UCL02a_1319.06_0.68.wav_ASR	they were talking
UCL02a_1320.557_1.02.wav_ASR	he's playing with his football
UCL02a_1321.818_1.27.wav_ASR	and he's playing football
UCL02a_1323.141_11.15.wav_ASR	but when he's scowling out with his football he smashes into a window maybe the neighbor or what have you
UCL02a_1335.475_4.96.wav_ASR	and he's hit a hole in his window
UCL02a_1340.882_4.03.wav_ASR	he's he's back because he's smashed into his his football
UCL02a_1346.475_4.81.wav_ASR	then his neighbor is then was actually that same into his house
UCL02a_1352.128_1.17.wav_ASR	his neighbor was set down
UCL02a_1353.343_7.07.wav_ASR	and suddenly he could see that his football was smashed into his glass window
UCL02a_1361.897_3.71.wav_ASR	so that's his his neighbor
UCL02a_1368.491_8.22.wav_ASR	and the guy he's just seen that he's can see that someone has smashed into his window
UCL02a_1377.61_2.64.wav_ASR	he come running with a little kitty and other of his friends

UCL02a_1385.553_1.45.wav_ASR	and he can't see where it is
UCL02a_1388.186_6.55.wav_ASR	but he can see obviously there's a big hole that's well in his window and his glass yeah
UCL02a_1396.458_0.67.wav_ASR	it was about it
UCL02a_1438.78_0.39.wav_ASR	okay

UCL02a_1476.593_1.51.wav_ASR	and think about the spanish was no
UCL02a_1483.502_1.02.wav_ASR	can't even think of the word
UCL02a_1484.68_0.42.wav_ASR	umbrella
UCL02a_1491.231_0.78.wav_ASR	that's english word
UCL02a_1493.031_0.77.wav_ASR	unhunh
UCL02a_1497.742_5.31.wav_ASR	he's come home with things

UCL02a_1506.216_1.49.wav_ASR	they're kind of say the english word for now
UCL02a_1514.282_1.22.wav_ASR	looks like i got a umbrella
UCL02a_1516.067_1.7.wav_ASR	and then he's sposta be
UCL02a_1522.5_2.45.wav_ASR	and anyway this woman little baby kid
UCL02a_1526.546_2.36.wav_ASR	the little baby kid wants to go out to the son
UCL02a_1528.93_2.3.wav_ASR	and and she goes out with her mom
UCL02a_1531.249_2.57.wav_ASR	and she just wants to give away the
UCL02a_1534.461_2.41.wav_ASR	oh me oh yeah
UCL02a_1542.572_2.39.wav_ASR	but i don't think the umbrella is this little little thing anyway
UCL02a_1545.564_0.49.wav_ASR	oh my goodness
UCL02a_1547.152_1.87.wav_ASR	confused what the engineering word is is not any
UCL02a_1550.339_1.76.wav_ASR	oh well little kid and he wants to go
UCL02a_1552.835_1.13.wav_ASR	little kitty wants to walk
UCL02a_1554.256_5.88.wav_ASR	and she's going off with her little umbrella and the little baby kid
UCL02a_1560.158_1.51.wav_ASR	and she's going out
UCL02a_1561.686_2.4.wav_ASR	then suddenly realizes it started to get wet
UCL02a_1564.243_0.59.wav_ASR	it's raining
UCL02a_1566.525_4.96.wav_ASR	little baby kid rushes back to school because it's is pouring down with rain as well
UCL02a_1573.344_1.59.wav_ASR	and she hasta go back in again
UCL02a_1575.035_1.04.wav_ASR	and she's speaking to her mom
UCL02a_1576.189_5.16.wav_ASR	and then she can see the little baby daughter she's really wet and pouring with rain
UCL02a_1581.364_2.38.wav_ASR	and she's back there as well because she's been very very cold
UCL02a_1585.185_1.78.wav_ASR	and now she can't remember what her
UCL02a_1587.492_1.17.wav_ASR	oh yes almost the way it's well
UCL02a_1591.198_3.82.wav_ASR	umbrella umbrella umbrella
UCL02a_1595.096_0.87.wav_ASR	yes i remember the word
UCL02a_1595.987_1.45.wav_ASR	but it's
UCL02a_1597.647_1.62.wav_ASR	and i couldn't think of the spanish word as well
UCL02a_1601.498_1.28.wav_ASR	umbrella umbrella
UCL02a_1602.8_0.8.wav_ASR	yeah that's it
UCL02a_1604.012_7.42.wav_ASR	so little baby kid as no got a umbrella after
UCL02a_1611.536_5.11.wav_ASR	and she's no that little stop is getting wet because it's raining a lot for the last time i suppose
UCL02a_1617.557_1.16.wav_ASR	yeah sorry everybody
UCL02a_1618.733_0.41.wav_ASR	remember
UCL02a_1619.809_1.47.wav_ASR	umbrella umbrella
UCL02a_1621.474_1.83.wav_ASR	and only think the spanish words as well as that
UCL02a_1624.323_1.51.wav_ASR	but i was too good at the sposta be
UCL02a_1625.854_0.58.wav_ASR	oh let me see
UCL02a_1626.911_1.15.wav_ASR	so it's difficult
UCL02a_1629.167_0.95.wav_ASR	that's beautiful
UCL02a_1631.164_1.42.wav_ASR	so anyway one word i just couldn't remember
UCL02a_1660.531_1.79.wav_ASR	for just tell you what's been happening now yeah
UCL02a_1671.515_0.47.wav_ASR	slipper
UCL02a_1672.334_0.67.wav_ASR	so much happier
UCL02a_1673.054_4.99.wav_ASR	it was like one's little couple couple little things
UCL02a_1678.595_1.87.wav_ASR	everything is so happy all the time
UCL02a_1681.017_1.0.wav_ASR	okay alright

wright204a_471.226_6.03.wav_ASR	oh i i don't really know what to say
wright204a_488.482_2.61.wav_ASR	oh i'm getting a little confused
wright204a_551.677_4.2.wav_ASR	the little boy is playing with a soccer ball i guess
wright204a_556.512_3.27.wav_ASR	and he happens to hit the window
wright204a_562.435_1.63.wav_ASR	and goes to the end
wright204a_564.087_8.98.wav_ASR	and it it the guy inside is is in the picture is sitting down
wright204a_573.142_3.66.wav_ASR	and it hits him or at least it comes in the window
wright204a_577.402_1.19.wav_ASR	so we've got class
wright204a_579.694_1.82.wav_ASR	and he goes
wright204a_581.882_2.06.wav_ASR	and he looks at the window
wright204a_583.994_0.79.wav_ASR	he has the ball
wright204a_584.804_8.2.wav_ASR	and apparently he's going out to see what happened and maybe let the ball go back to the child child
wright204a_611.342_0.53.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_612.361_1.49.wav_ASR	looks like it's ready for school
wright204a_614.634_3.67.wav_ASR	looks like he wants to take the umbrella
wright204a_619.559_2.09.wav_ASR	he's probably just said okay
wright204a_623.716_0.88.wav_ASR	did she say
wright204a_625.692_0.59.wav_ASR	maybe not
wright204a_626.402_0.35.wav_ASR	they don't know
wright204a_626.8_2.35.wav_ASR	because now he's going to school
wright204a_629.803_0.94.wav_ASR	oh it doesn't

wright204a_633.482_1.14.wav_ASR	thank you
wright204a_634.899_1.17.wav_ASR	oh i don't think i need it
wright204a_637.004_1.53.wav_ASR	he goes
wright204a_639.482_1.63.wav_ASR	and he must be waiting for the bus
wright204a_641.129_1.2.wav_ASR	and it's getting to rain
wright204a_642.924_2.12.wav_ASR	so now it's coming down pretty good
wright204a_645.498_1.72.wav_ASR	so he goes back to the house

wright204a_730.298_1.47.wav_ASR	oh that's that's a real picture
wright204a_733.872_5.81.wav_ASR	well this is a probably a flood storm
wright204a_740.511_1.38.wav_ASR	probably right here and there
wright204a_744.599_3.77.wav_ASR	the girl was apparently washed down the river
wright204a_749.301_2.17.wav_ASR	and this is her rescue
wright204a_752.238_8.31.wav_ASR	and she is handing on to a branch that they're trying to get him get her to safety
wright204a_764.718_0.38.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_772.353_0.32.wav_ASR	okay
wright204a_776.476_0.63.wav_ASR	yes i do
wright204a_903.564_5.15.wav_ASR	oh she was
wright204a_911.851_7.38.wav_ASR	the the story involves around the two daughters and the what i call the the cruel
wright204a_920.645_13.21.wav_ASR	and i i couldn't remember even from looking at that what the relationship was to the the good girl cinderella
wright204a_935.994_4.63.wav_ASR	yeah i know that she was like a servant
wright204a_941.361_9.2.wav_ASR	and had all to to was they were really putting her down
