AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0019663_0019800	oh yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0121416_0121534	yeah we're gonna meet up
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0035713_0035849	and i mean we're not even there yet
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0187312_0187486	one two one day after
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0085470_0085653	yeah that's what we need yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0128003_0128125	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0002779_0002990	yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0159403_0159664	we can always decide then i mean you know
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0150042_0150192	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0147125_0147573	oh well
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0099998_0100130	oh i don't know
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0183644_0183749	that's cool
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0104146_0104463	so even it doesn't work you can figure out and make it work
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0208960_0209241	but most will probably want to go with the falls
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0064139_0064653	you open the window you know close it again straight way
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0031789_0031923	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0114347_0114848	mean if you already started on on doing stuff i guess we can
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0001232_0001522	so what do you need to talk about
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0032731_0033237	we don't know what she should show what the user wants with it but it's interesting so why not give it to him
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0063079_0063650	probably just two or three of whatever whatever they're looking at like diallogon alphabet
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0117355_0118027	well whatever it was last week then
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0018003_0018170	that's a good point
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0089197_0089641	actually is the guy stuff that you've done
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0161524_0161669	don't be the whole thing but
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0047814_0048253	so it'll be a choice from the menu but yeah exactly
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0066991_0067105	physiotherapy
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0046605_0046933	well it might come to us as a start playing with him
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0150408_0150546	okay yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0127448_0127916	okay
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0207817_0207928	oh
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0069723_0070329	yeah changed the context of the same window from transformation to something
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0193221_0193326	yeah somebody else
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0093398_0093531	okay yeah okay
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0193805_0193935	into what
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0175999_0176266	maybe you should make it exercise
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0059290_0059432	oh
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0002820_0003016	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0186866_0187030	what one day
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0175667_0176204	that's fine
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0029777_0029908	yeah that's true yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0199994_0200131	or the
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0166778_0167381	the problem is june twenty third of february
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0125645_0125768	that's pretty sure it is
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0160782_0161336	well it'll be you know still limited verse of you know the next few years
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0044106_0044434	so it'll be all the cases of that topic
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0193562_0193757	well he's gonna get us across into the tree
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0087802_0087921	and it was a tough time for the guy
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0143627_0144045	coming coming out one by one at a time and running it
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0058505_0058736	you can't hear it probably or something
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0005142_0005935	we've got a rescue with which comes up absolutely with the transmission books and the tools
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0196589_0196765	so what time do we say
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0048635_0049016	yeah but then then there's the problem with a lot of windows popping up
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0116852_0117355	actually i haven't done anything this week because this week's been magic
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0192791_0192913	you do it to have a cake for it
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0203466_0203610	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0086888_0087101	so i guess that's what we needta aim for
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0140326_0140557	you know whatever you wanna do then just send me an email
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0077098_0077878	have all these sort of using the same window and so we can put a lot of and probably mutually understand
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0099449_0099697	and i could tell you what i done in april
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0190013_0190197	or three thirty
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0067707_0067992	oh you should be able to
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0038530_0038786	have a right click for for these very things
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0075205_0075352	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0022916_0023124	that's true yeah it's more interesting
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0103624_0103767	yeah i found some
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0206079_0206202	you can have a
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0136115_0136646	just that it you know you'd find a search object and then you search that
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0187767_0188059	oh in between those you know like one or three
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0022415_0022683	it's more obvious what you can do
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0189678_0189903	but yeah but what ever
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0049016_0049385	and they pop up without you even being quite sure what it is you know
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0085882_0086008	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0084417_0084676	it's not gonna be a lot more work
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0000540_0000872	little bit

AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0096253_0096476	the umbrella for meeting
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0075637_0075770	yeah you can minimize them
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0132517_0132635	and then yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0084151_0084417	pretty much getting there anyway to yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0174020_0174401	oh this is a science of reality
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0166387_0166559	oh
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0173753_0173939	that doesn't exist

AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0120585_0120701	yeah that's fun
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0057088_0057255	but at the moment no
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0178441_0178929	and then then we could discuss at next meeting which operations we really wanna clone
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0014755_0015291	but that be be five and only if you have left for one thing and double click for something else
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0118821_0118966	that's right
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0002707_0002820	it's like you've done some stuff

AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0056175_0056388	yeah single the single telephone phone
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0145209_0145714	so basically we're going to the the the answer to that is
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0158434_0159102	well probably get some work done over the weekend or something maybe just have a little quick little date and just
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0051484_0051863	yeah i'm trying out the window
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0115338_0115519	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0082966_0083521	and it kind of just develops i'm not amazing for anything
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0105376_0105513	umbrella
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0082025_0082238	what kind of prototype could be produced
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0073445_0073665	and you're always forever gone and get out the way
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0115829_0115980	meet up and see what we can do
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0059679_0060216	yeah because anyway it will increase him amount of disease we need by a lot
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0019685_0019789	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0082427_0082876	because i'm i'm just you know i go to the lab and i say what i wanna change today
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0201020_0201252	but i think
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0128090_0128300	but you could have a
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0019485_0019663	yeah yeah yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0129792_0130668	it does does an accident search for the prince i don't know crash or text or whatever
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0130698_0131380	four and it's just has an open variety this whatever find everything that's gone out
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0209873_0210490	yeah exactly just the other continent but whether you wanna do both speech and education
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0189903_0190011	what's what you're for
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0192373_0192682	oh well
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0169920_0170266	just looking at my own bed
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0149292_0149397	oh
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0209487_0209690	oh that was what he said
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0127378_0127795	well they did say it wasn't the most efficient
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0109386_0109613	okay
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0081037_0081143	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0115519_0115636	should we i don't know
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0155035_0155705	well i'm not doing any background reading you know
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0149932_0150211	you
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0083521_0083648	do we want it home for something
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0095493_0095832	and then there's a fall
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0068145_0068259	and she could do anything
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0002147_0002311	one a lot
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0056580_0057088	probably not but we might need them for this floods if we try to do it in the area
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0037629_0037844	is that just from the mean mean way
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0116848_0117033	yeah exactly exactly
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0120083_0120184	it's it's you
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0104872_0105003	missing around still
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0035475_0035713	yeah me and that's that's still another level
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0192242_0192775	we can look look now afterwards
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0109230_0110041	so it come up on the screen for the movie i haven't managed to put it into a video or whatever and giggle at it
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0211382_0211679	yeah so
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0137664_0137928	it's just you hafta write it in the way that we wrote it is how we did
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0015291_0015579	so yeah when you left
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0097001_0097137	okay
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0049626_0050203	but if you do double click on something don't you expect something to happen then
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0096861_0096996	it's just poor quality
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0116842_0116961	yeah yeah he says
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0199278_0199452	maybe it doesn't happen at all
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0088004_0088628	well i guess i mean that was probably our intention but we might not have written it down
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0097408_0097519	and i've got full as everything
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0083778_0083904	oh

AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0050456_0050574	it's not quite as it was
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0113394_0114347	yeah i mean it was a good point he had that collecting with the phone things
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0212592_0212738	mkay
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0170294_0170594	yeah but that's about it
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0098772_0098929	one someone else took about that stuff
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0119940_0120083	umbrella
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0085653_0085983	slightly more than just that on his own
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0160605_0160782	couldn't be that hard
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0136646_0136971	hadta figure out how to do the same thing for the story
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0183976_0184292	in the morning
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0122509_0122961	well the brush as i use it now or as you know

AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0043260_0043622	you mean that's kind of a typical kinda action that would happen
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0190345_0190549	then be certainly seriously short
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0050347_0050518	well i don't know
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0119388_0119603	but it's only a page long but quite difficult to write
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0121856_0122358	yeah hopefully have something by next week that we can sort of try together into the goo
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0071903_0072556	oh no it could be transformation like two different people and you're just present with whatever you want

AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0052354_0053059	but but yeah but i don't really see anything obvious that that
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0161669_0161948	we can just decide sort of things that we do
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0146751_0146953	you don't like she have that much to do at the moment
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0115980_0116747	mean i don't know see what you've done and see what we need more
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0191580_0192089	the the computer room in here the m s computer lab
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0050717_0050901	still coming up
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0172494_0172917	wasn't what you had now wasn't that pretty much what we agreed on
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0164731_0165115	yeah i'll get behind cycle you know pretty quick
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0163891_0164297	yes that i think we needta set ourselves some milestones because otherwise
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0175200_0175308	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0141020_0141277	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0068026_0068178	but
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0029782_0030242	don't really know how to involve the speech therapy and into the brushing
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0011582_0012313	or we can put an extra few buttons next to the umbrella
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0182306_0182820	can take it for a tour or something you know
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0147120_0147459	yeah sorry
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0202522_0202670	they didn't really know what was going on
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0167535_0167757	so so what's that two weeks maybe
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0199514_0199666	it sounds like me you know
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0143975_0144143	exactly yes
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0023804_0024042	but probably not gonna be out there for too many things
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0002801_0003073	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0176358_0176565	it's gonna be a little difficult
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0056935_0057122	well you know
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0000361_0000468	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0023492_0023804	oh where's the mini type thing is more flexible that way
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0168904_0169056	okay so
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0023440_0023676	where's maybe maybe
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0103473_0103608	yeah i can look at it
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0165115_0165239	like you're saying you know
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0192089_0192700	well if you find me i'll show you where all in there and we can go
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0150546_0150752	but i don't know doesn't matter
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0066942_0067089	alright
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0030336_0030633	yeah maybe tie that in with biology or something as well
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0042816_0043260	if we have it so set up that if you double click it it goes to a default thing on the menu
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0057255_0057500	but yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0031139_0031547	like we have it but what how it's to help the drawing
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0015579_0016074	you can for example set set the microphone so that the the audio goes from there i think
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0069694_0069876	but yeah that might be okay yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0142648_0142769	exactly
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0117533_0118031	well that's was nice yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0150022_0150349	oh oh
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0064834_0065636	but well i mean you probably i don't know if you wanna have the the the full translation and the summary at the same time
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0001521_0002417	well should we just go around and everyone says what they've been doing how far they've gone
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0124483_0124642	so when it
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0103286_0103406	oh
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0156712_0157002	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0089641_0090010	can we just like copy the latest stuff out of your directory or something
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0101383_0101731	yeah well i
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0142167_0142569	and i have dread to all the fun that you know that i don't need
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0186612_0186822	she monday monday maybe good
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0073095_0073445	there's why the fire truck has got a ladder
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0064862_0064969	they think we're doing fine
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0168794_0168904	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0002417_0002522	oh i've say
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0133778_0134161	words or so so just search for those files
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0191393_0191513	yeah well fun though
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0103097_0103239	oh that's pretty much there is it
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0066465_0066707	oh i was just thinking of tap
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0090334_0090526	can you ask the other people
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0048370_0048684	show the speech therapy for instance
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0128800_0129035	so or how does he wear that
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0050901_0051245	yeah it's not the whole world
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0208880_0209062	from the single umbrella
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0038786_0039120	yeah there's a second thing about the tops the top window
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0201252_0201545	so there's not my point in having
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0207928_0208146	what's on the top one
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0133367_0133778	and all the crash folks got the screen i know what it is
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0073967_0074082	and i like pops
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0185690_0185974	so so yeah no exactly exactly that's what i'm thinking
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0192975_0193087	okay
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0132390_0132517	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0018170_0018296	oh no
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0171814_0172395	and then if you want you can give that to me and i'll i'll build you nice you know a few tickets
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0079370_0079997	with transcriptions it seems reasonable to have maybe three other students then
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0157652_0158052	did we wanna meet before we talked to firstnames next week
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0051763_0052198	well i'll check what it does on on double click at the moment yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0112504_0113049	so i'm sure i'm making it
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0174055_0174256	yeah that's quite impressive
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0177789_0177962	and decide on that over the weekend
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0108343_0108907	five i've been trying to write something to read the exam and get rid of it
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0213503_0213747	oh

AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0067699_0067902	don't think firstnamev knows how to do that right
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0210621_0210766	yeah that's about it
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0194037_0194480	yeah it's okay but it would do quite good for a job
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0160177_0160605	well sure why not
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0090504_0090785	you can make if you make it worthwhile then everybody can enjoy it
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0196431_0196575	well the company i'm thinking
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0201901_0202026	oh something like that
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0105058_0105219	but but yes okay that's good

AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0177317_0177653	we never agreed on what we wanna be able to search for
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0053232_0053373	mean if you can think of something
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0028511_0029029	it's more part of the

AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0016268_0016434	so we can't put it on the left
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0017064_0017669	so right click on it may you know and you can speak a conversation pops the window
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0120427_0120774	yeah that's pretty good

AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0022303_0022415	well oh yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0135749_0136115	well it's in the code
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0151914_0152324	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0041128_0042077	so we have basically two options of of brownings the meetings is by either earlier or later
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0127599_0127915	it does load up quite quickly
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0087314_0087615	so it's a start to do stuff rather than just be
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0207601_0208075	can you read that
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0016638_0016875	we could for example have a little money that pops up
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0093261_0093398	it could just be easy two and a half
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0090010_0090601	if we're gonna just try to take a look or something i think it can if
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0117886_0118016	oh
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0196807_0196960	and i just think it's better to do after
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0142769_0142891	yes
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0099194_0099473	one two and one
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0023119_0023309	well i could have both but whatever
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0074042_0074793	but maybe people get used to mean when you use windows or lights for that matter you have a lot of windows open
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0080687_0080793	yeah so
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0102255_0102357	hmhm
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0101792_0102458	it was found at the theatre but involved surgery but i haven't read it yet
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0102357_0102731	so it probably just use that code like that was behind the question she asked them earlier
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0173610_0173763	oh
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0093919_0094050	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0096372_0096633	yes i'm for meeting
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0117033_0117172	so you're still working
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0030899_0031139	just some way to sort of liberate that information
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0188886_0189228	otherwise you wanna do after after
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0202026_0202188	but i think one two three four five six
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0186274_0186440	pick it up
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0050901_0051126	he
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0153272_0153425	oh
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0195537_0195672	that's coming
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0019281_0019509	yeah so yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0086536_0086642	yeah definitely
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0213148_0213262	should we turn these off or on
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0002787_0003057	okay
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0061410_0061622	they think it's ready to go
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0171085_0171814	maybe you should decide pretty pretty early what kind of things you wanna be able to search for
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0094000_0094135	oh yeah you're number
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0157002_0157469	oh i know is that about it then or and anything else we needta discuss
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0097137_0097408	now i'm i'm extremely organized to say
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0204721_0204855	okay
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0156411_0156771	have you ever when this course is over okay
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0156158_0156528	oh here me too
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0021828_0022161	well no you still have the money the money pop up that
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0103281_0103473	well i don't know if it's too simple
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0026438_0026635	is that gonna be useful or too much
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0118578_0118835	well you're in pl pl pl pl and sl pl
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0018136_0018302	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0067627_0067774	oh
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0036739_0036844	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0081658_0082025	and finally the prototype he spoke about
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0190197_0190345	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0182497_0182770	you know the class path and all that sort of thing
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0192972_0193082	he's gone a lot of water
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0103100_0103274	he found some code for it
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0003057_0003385	well i've got a problem now which
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0206959_0207489	the same things as in the country if i could read it
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0057083_0057836	mean we might use them while to work with them but do you wanna introduce them and so that when you brush you can
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0045256_0045466	oh
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0186440_0186706	you know let me know whatever
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0142891_0143171	so they're all in there yet still
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0111440_0111661	yeah i'm sure i do
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0036813_0037031	thank you
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0049470_0049688	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0142482_0142647	just in case
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0091362_0091506	they might be maybe
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0047821_0048342	oh so and it figures out what's the most common useta do
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0148033_0148494	oh i can't remember what i'm sposta do by the way
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0050686_0050787	yeah exactly
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0181742_0182107	just all the and seeing the code and just sort of see the basics of what you've done
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0044434_0044882	either whatever we decide with the detail to be whether it's in all meetings or just in one meeting
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0196423_0196524	whatever it is in my computer
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0055367_0055554	slipper slipper
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0106854_0107249	oh i mean how much do you actually need to do
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0108907_0109230	and i can get rid of it but i'm having trouble putting it anywhere else
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0152113_0152802	well i'm doing communications which we had one exercise and done that two weeks ago
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0045449_0045889	so if somebody knows exactly what they wanna do and we know that's the most common thing that's gonna happen
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0213928_0214081	is she still here
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0190431_0190658	mean three three or four after
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0197879_0198035	as long as dna doesn't go late
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0064717_0064841	oh i think it's fine
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0200596_0201020	we have one college at least when we speak in person we don't have any lessons
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0019509_0019685	so but yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0205523_0205676	was there anything else
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0004091_0004413	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0075352_0075888	and less because you can minimize them and stuff like that
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0197135_0197413	rather than have half an hour and then we'll surely run out
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0066363_0066473	it's like have a tomb there
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0195765_0196060	oh he's that the football
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0145854_0146061	the weekend's still four days off
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0061004_0061410	yeah what what people think in general about the windows covering that he's mentioned
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0068134_0068297	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0160327_0160522	you're gonna improve this
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0029382_0029782	more than the speech pathologist
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0127915_0128090	so you know it's not too bad
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0033408_0033513	three i i think we should do it
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0067816_0068028	oh you're right
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0070776_0071251	yeah or even just have buttons on it for that window
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0159741_0159994	so what what what are you planning to do over the weekend
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0205048_0205523	yeah i guess that's it
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0050651_0051022	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0019405_0019811	yeah you know it would be a bit weird for it to just start bringing up stuff without it
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0158298_0158434	well i don't know
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0139668_0140326	if you have a question about what the the code means or where to find the code
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0005038_0005142	so yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0057791_0058099	you might wanna be able to say oh just give me what that person saying
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0067902_0068026	maybe he probably can
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0052255_0052654	yeah that's good
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0128916_0129092	oh no this is not the actual sentence
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0040426_0040582	and it's consistent throughout
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0138539_0139209	so you could use that when you if you wanna take the date out and put it on
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0122358_0122504	come
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0184390_0184885	well this time i'm thinking that time because i if i'm not there you don't do anything
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0124736_0125544	to get the summary today you hafta serve for i think the ideas or something
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0026807_0027289	so what part of the the menu that comes down is says give me all your meals or something
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0148494_0148752	am i sposta do the some sort of thing
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0014263_0014755	so that i don't know what happens when you double click actually
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0001907_0002369	is that what you done anything
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0044882_0045291	and she shows up the the particular instance of that topic in the meeting
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0191260_0191791	we well we can get in through the the the card the card yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0173365_0173753	that's completely cut and paste
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0120774_0121027	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0054234_0054469	and guess it depends on the
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0023188_0023463	like we want it more things in the future than we have now new businesses
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0172917_0173184	or was it just like that one
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0159233_0159403	yeah if you like
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0153784_0153900	oh i'm sorry yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0040278_0040500	and have a different menu for
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0185631_0185865	yeah it's not gonna take an hour to explain it you know
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0071899_0072058	it's gonna be you know
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0201698_0201870	it was just a bank holiday wasn't it
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0022651_0023204	they're going yes
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0102731_0103149	yeah the reuse and stuff and it's just okay okay
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0209644_0209866	yeah i think it comes of the busyness of the same as what you said
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0156771_0157064	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0101685_0101792	yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0086073_0086473	just so see the operation works sort of between the different different
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0004372_0004550	it wasn't good
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0077822_0077961	exercising
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0149880_0150007	it's alright
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0117363_0117533	yes exactly
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0003804_0004372	oh well drop mine as well
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0076219_0076581	yeah like a lot of these can be like once we get the disease's out then we can you know
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0077961_0078225	yeah that that was the plan for the disaster anyway
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0196960_0197135	and then we have all the time we need
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0006879_0007304	and i think the search works as well so you can pop up a search
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0156246_0156562	oh be happy when this week is over
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0043622_0044106	if you double click on a particular topic or something then it goes to sort of like detailed view
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0068294_0068404	he really knew what he did
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0177980_0178441	yeah you know just get together and think about the different types of surgery
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0076972_0077180	yeah that's true they're they're definitely
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0126372_0126907	so they don't say look in that and that fold but they say search everything
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0141114_0141347	oh yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0098011_0098236	it was everywhere
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0150349_0150482	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0202348_0202617	yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0164782_0164907	weeks we'll go by
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0090732_0091278	well if you just tell the directory and just make the phone number then we know the directory to get in then and just
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0017692_0017968	well could we have the money
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0182770_0183332	oh just to say okay well here everything's busy and set up and then just you know just jump right there
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0141861_0142167	that they gave us a lot of extra stuff
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0058175_0058529	oh i mean it's not gonna make much sense if you listen to it on its own
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0188627_0188749	it was one time day and only
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0056045_0056157	you mean single child
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0187237_0187767	one time not at noon or two or four
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0030163_0030404	it'll be nice to have it in contact with
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0200409_0200538	don't think you have a reading weight
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0112175_0112406	oh yeah oh well
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0104524_0104872	well probably self do this other one file and i don't know quarter
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0012313_0012838	but so you click on a button and then the opens whatever that speech category is
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0103608_0104072	but but i found some code for from a tutorial about indexing
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0204092_0204431	well probably yeah of course
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0093781_0093953	it's in all the emails
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0203610_0204092	they'll probably have one to make up for her missing glass slipper
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0082870_0083007	okay
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0039767_0039903	yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0188093_0188254	but he said
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0198860_0199278	what's she doesn't even know what she's talking about yet
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0110041_0110272	but i guess it's not very difficult
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0055863_0056045	we don't know yeah the way i think
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0156044_0156191	hmhm
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0032507_0032731	it's like a nice thing

AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0058736_0058939	but somebody's taking over somebody else or something
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0000789_0000894	okay
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0050661_0051319	especially if you have a touchpad

AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0040963_0041128	so yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0039955_0040278	so we could do that in a simple way do it right quick as well

AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0091683_0091941	you know they're not really
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0062635_0063079	well the thing is typically though someone could have five windows open at the same time probably not
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0076581_0077006	of course with the disability
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0055554_0055657	do you wanna use them or not

AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0024337_0025195	you can have a menu instead of a
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0106053_0106854	well when he talked about this with the phone
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0189157_0189286	yeah that's an operation

AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0150440_0150541	shall i do that then
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0022781_0022916	yeah that's right
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0007304_0007975	and it loads up just the background window so empty and so when you start
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0060216_0060330	the book will be big
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0153288_0153740	yeah it's nine nine courses or ten something
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0213391_0213503	we're done now
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0121271_0121856	yeah i was thinking the weekend probably get started at
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0173910_0174620	oh this is a union

AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0170421_0170824	oh when the the second image
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0132635_0133008	because every every of these
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0155656_0155807	so
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0199088_0199348	let's see
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0173939_0174331	nicely done
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0092884_0093251	so the directory is my number
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0137199_0137656	hadta understand how they did the contract to do the summer i guess
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0023050_0023188	but then it's not as excellent
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0093642_0093761	what's your umbrella
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0155364_0155633	oh
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0037844_0038530	is that's what it's from any particular window if we wanna sort of get if we're on the users versus like a topic or something
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0080447_0080587	yeah and i kind of makes sense
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0036798_0036933	yes
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0027270_0027918	yeah so when you right click on it one one option will be given you all your meetings categorized a
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0069530_0069723	or just i don't know
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0068460_0068785	it's a bit of a trip
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0175377_0175487	it's green stuff of gulf
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0111508_0111638	put it in to window at least
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0124017_0124283	but i think it's old but i'm not quite sure how it works
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0193279_0193562	because i was asking firstnames about that whether we can get in there
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0004152_0004342	you get this
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0009603_0010391	now i wonder how we wanna do you know we want to pop up window with the speech category
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0212165_0212502	it's it's
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0063967_0064139	and the summer for example is beautiful
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0010958_0011582	five either we can when you click on the the idea any sort of i'd like it
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0076088_0076284	of course she can't actually
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0000096_0000665	one under how much of the meeting is talking about the stuff at the meeting
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0180527_0180987	so we don't sort of hafta do all the work again of just figure out stuff

AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0179871_0180527	it would be nice to i don't meet up and you can sort of show us a bit what you know already
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0037812_0037941	even if one thing comes up
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0018238_0018642	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0104422_0104524	yeah i'm probably
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0029176_0029382	brushing sort of thing
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0107984_0108254	you hafta convert it to some sort of form i suppose
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0102714_0102868	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0036933_0037201	so should we try try to do a right click window then

AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0034102_0034749	well if you get to speak a category that someone talks a lot in certain topic
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0202962_0203257	it was up to the professor whether they did it or not
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0110616_0110841	it's not really you know much but fine
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0206578_0206731	oh i think he basically said
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0016945_0017081	yeah that might be quite good
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0167730_0167888	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0101290_0101489	oh yeah all the searching stuff

AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0179135_0179603	that would be very valuable as well to see what that can do
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0000872_0001183	okay
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0105467_0105681	yeah i guess that's it

AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0047144_0047355	like we have the the right click menu

AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0067598_0067821	but i don't know but
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0008861_0009603	the conversation books has got a surprise button button which doesn't do anything yet
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0010620_0010958	either we could do that you know when it's a poppa come
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0151690_0152141	what course should i be doing anyway
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0064653_0064783	but it be good to have it there
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0091245_0091452	yeah sure
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0051126_0051364	yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0183247_0183443	show you what bits the code
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0085854_0085988	yeah so you can plug it in
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0028408_0028527	was that too much
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0031855_0031976	oh well yeah i mean
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0021798_0022021	it's more if it's visual
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0033538_0033648	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0067356_0067509	oh i'm not sure yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0040143_0040498	so so this one is for
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0210996_0211532	and now we have seven percent of the course already done
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0128615_0128800	or it's just what's behind it
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0197709_0197863	oh okay
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0025014_0026007	but actually what we could do is in in that manner as well we could have an operation that pops up a window with all the meetings that that usage has been in
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0045889_0046271	so the double click will do that and just save them the trouble of writing and choosing the word on the menu
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0024746_0024904	yes
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0195774_0196406	hey we could follow up on a situation if we want to
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0098653_0098772	yeah so that's me done
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0128171_0128615	but what what is it like a window where you hafta write a certain word
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0194480_0194796	because it can only say that's not very many people in it
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0203347_0203466	yeah okay
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0144143_0144248	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0167893_0168151	well how about we get it done by then
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0198623_0198860	and she's not even confounded yet
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0175679_0176358	it's just so much fun
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0036696_0036798	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0059095_0059365	what do you say right now and put it in there
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0066650_0066792	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0092632_0092884	well i'll make that read to you
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0160140_0160327	you're gonna do the sentence
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0000037_0000174	funny though
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0150839_0151060	and then it's just you know play around with some extra stuff
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0080411_0080636	yeah do you
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0065756_0066343	so maybe you could just use the same window for transformation and surgery
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0033648_0034102	maybe i could have that other thing of
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0182467_0182780	yeah yeah the
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0176565_0177317	yeah i mean i was going to but you know the whole dropped down millions and stuff what we wanna search for is not quite agreed on
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0018372_0018517	everything
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0031661_0031855	well you mean the the speech card or something
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0079024_0079145	maybe he's close to the water
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0211213_0211427	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0129092_0129792	you know to load the truck for certain meeting
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0127795_0128003	very clear you know
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0139133_0139328	but i was just thinking that yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0026135_0026438	like a sentence for that use
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0095954_0096182	and it's called the umbrella
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0041033_0041181	and then this one is on
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0109389_0109550	okay
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0181028_0181137	oh just the business
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0119796_0120427	it wasn't much but it was i hafta sit there and think about it for a bit
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0052198_0052354	because i think it might do something
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0162062_0162239	well actually most of the time just dialing
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0144045_0144630	okay okay
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0210862_0210996	oh
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0031547_0031789	or what can i give us in the drawing
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0072615_0073007	yeah that were june of wednesday we needed it
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0126161_0126273	that's
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0160037_0160177	church
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0003404_0003804	good
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0040691_0040809	on the speaker
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0192004_0192373	what if we take a tour
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0018302_0018699	but anyway we just have a lot of
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0096404_0096606	or case
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0153901_0154781	and then i'm doing parallel programming languages and systems which we had one exercise as well and that's in like friday
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0208436_0208731	they really want multiple windows from a single lap
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0209467_0209577	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0177666_0177789	oh two
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0013878_0014055	the the left leg alright
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0197125_0197320	so after dinner
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0045291_0045449	and just think it to have the detail there
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0071604_0071899	one a lot different way we can do it it doesn't don't hafta be a tomb or whatever
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0190727_0190876	actually we can't get in there though
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0105647_0105801	so you think it should be too difficult
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0107796_0107929	oh i see
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0173310_0173625	that's completely correct
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0202080_0202399	one two three four five six seven eight
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0024560_0025014	and the peanut butter
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0094981_0095082	see that again oh four
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0142647_0142936	oh my goodness
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0101141_0101294	what are you doing again
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0193087_0193279	just bank on it
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0145448_0145854	oh well okay
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0185309_0185690	my schedule's a class a class you know that sort of thing
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0115704_0115871	okay that makes sense
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0091303_0091783	well it's no but the thing's if you check them both you wanna see all the things
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0038013_0038142	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0113350_0113593	so maybe it comes with something wonderful as well
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0112878_0113350	as i said you know if you left click on something for example
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0032508_0032636	oh i see
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0133510_0133859	so then it just goes through and says if this word occurs that doesn't prince
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0077159_0077621	there is but i i've made a lot of changes to it
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0138826_0139583	we can write something we'll try and do on the fly and and improve if if that's gonna take too long
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0031677_0031881	was there anything else we wanted to add to the timeline
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0089209_0089625	oh well
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0023970_0024180	he's only gonna tell us he's gone already
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0045428_0046024	we say we're still amazing for the development to be complete and everything
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0126120_0126533	but that will mean that you can only do things on wednesday
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0161805_0161922	yeah yeah that makes sense
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0172114_0172473	yeah okay actually no no actually that's a good idea i'll take one quick look over
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0125789_0125942	they're running to the final
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0136598_0136789	he's probably that's more difficult
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0065557_0065912	mean with the entrance that this is done
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0175251_0175396	oh
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0023249_0023358	yes
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0143725_0143963	well we don't wanna hafta do that right
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0136789_0136955	you're just fighting the code out
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0156582_0157089	but you know it doesn't make any difference really either way to me
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0099364_0099946	just that it's hard to tell what kind of object it was originally once it's put into a litter box or something
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0082502_0083092	or do we want them all in one pan with a different color or something to create what type of resolve there
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0034821_0035259	that's that's too big yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0033101_0033591	probably wanna think about if we wanna change our goals and stuff
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0071456_0071927	and then you'll tell you what activities it's gone
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0130301_0130473	it would just be a blob like a summer
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0018936_0019111	so it's not even really
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0121635_0121783	yeah that's true yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0023513_0023630	hmhm
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0126624_0126989	yeah if we're gonna do the exam then fine that's that's probably the most important
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0064215_0064651	yeah my tenth is two broken things to more and more
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0174290_0174848	okay we're changing diallogues
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0106955_0107583	yeah i mean at the moment it works with high lighting in in the window window doesn't
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0034973_0035184	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0085733_0086046	so it'll be on the church window
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0085080_0085345	what's what you thinking
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0032460_0032772	well that's that's the original one
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0169934_0170046	maybe a slipper
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0068274_0068805	thing i was wondering about that is i haven't looked at it so much
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0169706_0169850	yeah well
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0087384_0087866	and so if you wanna do that way you probably doesn't matter too much
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0171724_0172114	oh okay i i can be sure you know i'm sending them to me that's fine
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0045439_0045574	he's he's broken the window
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0047298_0047592	give me a week and i'll tell you the answer
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0021454_0021977	so i know if there's enough stuff that you think should be done to this i could do that before i
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0091653_0091831	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0042375_0042600	vegetable on top or something
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0164101_0164355	so i'm thinking
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0047576_0047898	should we put it a a hundred that something like that might happen in the department
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0058470_0058757	well if we're skipping the o t one then then things like that here
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0042968_0043351	plus plus or minus three days yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0175396_0175540	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0098888_0099364	thinking sometimes in a case like that run across in other languages
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0128989_0129377	so i guess just discovering it is right
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0132233_0133122	it's just another one of these meetings not necessarily long it's just words and to print all of them out selectively
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0144569_0145137	and i gave up doing that completely and just devoted back to night stuff because it was much much easier
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0111951_0112094	oh some
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0174199_0174381	he's like no
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0084213_0084627	well at the moment is there a window that comes up
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0018829_0018936	but that didn't help on this page
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0159237_0159400	it's just a fall really
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0132149_0132290	oh yes
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0094978_0095288	mean essentially they're you know in time order
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0131930_0132233	it's gonna take long to to prove anyway
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0144731_0144890	okay
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0136955_0137127	it would be the same thing
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0171687_0171790	but
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0083744_0083850	yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0160891_0161131	yeah i continued the feature work in my section
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0041252_0041505	meet these mall stores yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0078856_0079508	that you said that you had written some things that maybe have caused some bugs and that you were kinda fix those on the weekend or something
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0024853_0025092	thank you
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0076781_0077134	so is there did you if you've made another umbrella
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0133236_0133358	it does on the phone anyway
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0118569_0118766	and everybody
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0035247_0035573	that's gonna be we don't even know how to propose that at the moment i think
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0121016_0121339	because then we need all the other day if we want to keep it a transfer right
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0048189_0048321	yeah that's right
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0059565_0059750	oh not the this one
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0026408_0026675	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0135590_0136024	prince on both sides and if it's not proper weather then prince one
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0047485_0047593	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0129316_0129464	it's fine yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0028436_0028592	he never good
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0110572_0111480	yeah i mean the whole what feels the transmission books and all of these books is a special sort of pain made by night
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0041751_0041938	mean we haven't really yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0161282_0162274	and i said what done so far and what i'm gonna do and some some issues and then that was
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0161522_0161681	well maybe you could
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0029731_0030110	actually i notice that noone is
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0174089_0174996	okay
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0044006_0044251	slippery
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0092292_0092417	maybe yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0091839_0091961	yeah yeah three points
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0034547_0034909	that's what i thought as well i mean do we are we actually gonna attempt that
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0046016_0046324	it's been a couple of years since i was done already
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0138184_0138407	you know the chip phone then you don't ever hafta prove it
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0015707_0015897	okay yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0046502_0047118	is are one of those something that you wanna change and delete from our list of operations
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0041758_0041920	you know develop a program
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0024180_0024754	really okay
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0176364_0176543	oh oh alright
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0151304_0151743	because just seems like a little tinkering here and there and just adding couple things
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0112214_0112478	oh no i don't know what it's cold
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0017785_0018043	the thing is i was singing even in the rest of that
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0130473_0130975	it won't look like it we don't say speech recues this because this
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0048321_0048439	three i i really wanna do it
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0095725_0095842	yeah maybe she should do that
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0172473_0172728	trying to get it as good as i think that way yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0023859_0023970	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0150225_0150542	just to get things i don't know moving at a high level i guess
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0116540_0116682	okay
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0124910_0125118	not not store at all whatsoever
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0088813_0089409	oh no
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0056905_0057415	should we don't know what we think about our things the way we have together
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0016742_0017526	yeah we could this could be just some little just just describe some scenes or something
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0127290_0127571	we're not gonna do much more than just look at the
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0079643_0079886	after the weekend
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0125942_0126120	and of course she said it would be done
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0158908_0159085	yeah so i it's after twelve
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0053740_0054016	should we change the dinner
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0132163_0132382	and i don't think that's true
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0063158_0063436	so i wanna get something i wanna see this i wanna get it together
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0173283_0173628	one two and one
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0065968_0066281	and it's not him at all
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0141101_0141775	slip it in to you just transfer like stll cl
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0025799_0025919	oh i have lots of time now
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0137251_0138184	you know the the good way of doing it not together is that if someone doesn't wanna look at the the
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0164381_0164747	because if you have a scissor thing here and then another scissor thing there it
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0149964_0150225	and other horses they could give
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0028943_0029179	laughing
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0114691_0114955	ten years oh something like that yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0109343_0109760	it was just as long as we implement one of these interfaces for this particular type of window
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0039384_0039848	we prefer to concentrate on the main but
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0074504_0074606	slipper or something yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0023630_0023745	that's a good idea
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0152397_0153316	it should be successful and you know coming up with the the real nice ideas and then just you know bringing those to reality
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0079969_0080142	okay okay
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0103329_0103842	yes just from past experience i there's gooey little things that happen
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0168522_0168675	so part from there yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0176882_0177179	well
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0175983_0176353	yeah in twelve thirty to remember with
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0029595_0030227	so
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0028668_0028943	oh just leave your computer on maybe
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0081582_0082029	like if we have topics as well as other
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0109120_0109343	wasn't firstnamej saying something about that
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0030764_0031418	yeah do what you wanna do with it first and then
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0131287_0131598	then it would look ugly probably because it will look just blank and white
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0086485_0086802	so so you click those and it's just lots of
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0069665_0070203	also in in extract time stamps and stuff like that
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0047900_0048145	maybe the speech characteristics may get slurring
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0031329_0031464	actually
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0029280_0029409	yeah so maybe
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0145900_0146161	okay
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0071927_0072435	and then you can even do it absolutely or you can just hard cold and say get you the time stops
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0169683_0170405	yeah maybe asleep
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0062365_0063158	you know at least very recently have a guy and war
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0104204_0104330	well have a look
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0164747_0165061	if they're not together you lose a lot of the conversation
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0092417_0092558	yeah that's true
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0129377_0129503	but well anyway
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0135186_0135590	so if certain you know if it's a proper word
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0032636_0032810	oh this is the one that okay
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0163372_0163537	three i think that doesn't make sense
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0049921_0050095	but we might not you know
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0147522_0147857	like just to see what what system they use to develop this stuff
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0055519_0055766	and more detailed specifically
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0109760_0110058	oh we should be able to have that lighting
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0051363_0051551	okay
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0106677_0106952	or vegetables or whatever the stuff
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0147168_0147522	actually i'm thinking i might try to talk to who's a firstnamej and firstnameg
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0114635_0114909	ten ten yeah i don't know
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0094497_0094659	how do we wanna order them in the first place
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0027526_0027739	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0174848_0174986	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0079847_0079969	alright
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0105308_0105835	because you're working with an event handler with the one panel or whatever it is
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0162852_0163194	it's sometimes it's easy to have the talk in its own voice you know
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0064651_0065348	well i don't know what we sent it in the afternoon maybe i can answer a few questions too when i've done
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0147857_0148685	because it'd be nice if you have all the tools there and just have the object model and just kind of like exactly used a system
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0014147_0014312	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0046324_0046575	yeah two days okay
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0158643_0158795	but it has already released it anyway
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0131677_0131891	it's probably best than two as you said
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0084148_0084359	or three like sub sub sub sub sub sub sub sub
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0031135_0031257	seventy years
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0131891_0132149	just like yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0026045_0026664	and then we'll send it to you and you can do the final revisions
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0120335_0121016	like not as extreme as it was what was on a train trip or something
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0106952_0107083	so
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0168840_0169092	oh i'll sleep a lot
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0143107_0143373	but that might even be an error way
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0027533_0027852	oh i know you're always on line
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0089503_0089859	so so when we click you know tops and bottoms for what we wanna search
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0067581_0067962	well i'm still struggling with a jar of stuff
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0141775_0142195	and then it's kind of like there's usually things built in two well should be built in two jar
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0055764_0056002	well you could put you know
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0154087_0154810	yeah why don't you put both of both of those ideas into that that paragraph and say you'll have a look at both of them or something
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0090467_0090932	but then you can't see all of them at the same time and it's just
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0057638_0057891	yeah i think so yeah yeah inveterate
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0004581_0004696	oh make fun of her
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0172761_0173069	yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0176443_0176700	stethoscope
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0075640_0075774	that's ten what it is
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0124458_0124617	yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0094729_0094978	yeah i think yeah probably by meeting makes most sense
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0031257_0031387	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0115991_0116432	one night october i think so
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0121398_0121828	you're very much live what you can do with it if it's not important at all that's the problem
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0171979_0172091	going i don't know
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0059545_0059671	at the desk okay
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0013743_0013850	okay yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0115317_0115547	yeah why what's the name anyway
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0071209_0071456	good thanks to you for it turns the list of activities
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0053774_0054353	we should probably do other responses as well
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0012313_0012414	like the time i
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0093986_0094497	yeah well i mean if you even the second step the first question is do we want it
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0162560_0162760	you might lose a bit of continuity if you do that
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0024214_0024440	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0045213_0045428	and you can say yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0056791_0056905	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0162054_0162383	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0042654_0042791	more or less
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0154810_0154970	if you wanna do it
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0104599_0105080	so you wanna go to the actual high school or high school
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0121828_0122215	there's some background that puts things back into context
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0018560_0018829	oh yes yeah actually that's the very first engine
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0118766_0119675	because i'm wondering how we're gonna write it back to aja
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0008661_0008947	everyone's looking down reading
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0065842_0065968	and that's the end
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0093620_0094088	oh i guess that was the other thing whether we wanna have a restaurant by college and all that
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0162274_0162383	one thing at a time
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0041627_0041784	you have should have a section probably
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0020013_0020117	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0168333_0168547	it's good
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0152034_0152305	oh no no it shouldn't be no
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0093846_0093986	how to order
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0023125_0023329	and that perfection right
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0103842_0104599	and just doesn't let you save certain things and it's just kinda trying to do a different kind of to go to a different window
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0078362_0078473	so it's friday
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0115547_0115719	one two and one
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0059750_0059870	oh
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0139583_0140140	if it's gonna take longer we'll think about writing it to a file and doing it off line
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0162278_0162642	yeah here is what we've done already and then you know down here
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0048321_0048484	okay you want me to do it
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0060166_0060504	and no if i'm time to look at that before tomorrow
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0025267_0025508	oh
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0077134_0077273	is that something that i should
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0148685_0148921	you're at a high level rather than kinda you know
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0072435_0073145	so i think the best it's cold start time and end
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0014437_0014850	and i'm not sure if we need the outside of the prototype
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0153323_0153432	that's the high people
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0174381_0174703	there's other one
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0023358_0023660	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0036715_0036928	yeah yeah that's right
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0087255_0087384	one two three and
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0003990_0004240	like take notes just the same time i guess
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0149408_0149827	so i might try to contact them see if they're okay
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0060504_0060724	we could just make it up
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0102270_0102935	broken leg leg saying if if you found a sentence then color it print it in red or whatever
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0125288_0125530	yeah that's why i think we
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0003703_0003815	okay
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0012730_0013102	so it's all whatever in academic
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0015004_0015184	well the thing is yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0142195_0142837	to process okay and just create whatever file it's gonna be and
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0075776_0075883	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0128644_0128816	it's we're not doing the audio thing
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0059159_0059383	have you taken any more of a
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0087866_0088246	just trying to think if there's any other issue down the road i'm depending on
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0089021_0089334	okay not three different okay okay
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0130120_0130471	good at the discipline you know taking the discipline and me yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0079699_0079847	alright yeah okay
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0061496_0061766	have you managed any further on the second thing
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0170268_0170525	umbrella umbrella
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0078524_0078671	but i will tonight that's the point
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0067239_0067390	for the eventful
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0156430_0156582	ten file or nine or whatever it is
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0018043_0018395	just through the screen shops in there when you talk to me about what you're doing right now
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0044869_0045188	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0086849_0086950	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0127716_0128450	the the text would remove this flowers because we're not gonna search it and we're not gonna listen to it
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0125664_0125902	that's sort of what we're thinking before
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0048678_0049161	if at least have all the information pop up that's already in the meta data file
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0036788_0037258	and thus we discover some sort of time work thing that's not gonna happen
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0164968_0165091	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0038266_0038901	and say yeah we didn't decide the the time is too short
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0101561_0101936	if you do it right you get the result
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0119829_0119979	writing it back to
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0029410_0029595	but i'm never on line on the phone
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0083092_0083471	so when you know click on that it's gonna go to the relative thing
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0140051_0140536	it's just be a statement when they're
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0022984_0023725	thank you
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0025658_0025799	oh i'm happy to do some as well
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0157956_0158182	especially with gabriel and
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0013822_0013944	okay
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0020117_0020934	and anyway so so yeah it's just very general structure i guess from this we can just pop in our little bulbs and and
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0157402_0157749	that's about the only issue i have with on the fly whether it's fast enough
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0036472_0036842	should have more time this is what we had more time
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0148921_0149202	playing around with the little bit cold and moderate and that
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0123724_0123835	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0058396_0058593	should we
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0120575_0120691	there's a book of texts
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0042132_0042351	exactly
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0101496_0101599	where's it coming from
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0107851_0108601	and i think he was saying that as long as we implement that it should work with everything that we do
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0077621_0077969	so i might just delete what i've done and copy it from here
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0146596_0146733	but i'm serious
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0115208_0115321	mostly things are good
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0153159_0153266	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0008166_0008661	very interesting part of the movie
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0074447_0074908	yeah that's on the the the umbrella
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0044105_0044380	so i got six days to do the paperwork and everything
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0037281_0037580	yeah but that's definitely one thing we could just remove
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0078539_0078676	oh i thought you said okay
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0060724_0061147	well i'll clean one you claim the other for the church things and then we could leave that one as a a joint one
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0125902_0126033	actually but this makes more sense
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0012470_0012730	actually for that i was just copying the one straight out to the other document
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0023725_0023859	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0021247_0021366	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0134183_0134337	it's a bunch of things
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0031881_0032249	you mean he essentially was what you can't see him right there
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0036107_0036226	good food and
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0174996_0175109	it's good yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0098204_0098433	yeah why don't you just
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0027739_0028052	oh well
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0171516_0171724	or do one two or no
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0079598_0079699	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0129404_0129617	yeah yeah you don't really need to do much more with it
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0138300_0138507	and they can yeah exactly
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0163537_0164018	but maybe at the end maybe just a point form you know things that we'll do
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0028865_0029045	he he presented
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0140531_0141101	it was just thinking as well we mean we probably even use excel too to kind of just transform it and
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0060478_0060694	yeah it might be yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0143934_0144261	one i wouldn't wanna put it back too easy
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0086802_0087255	yeah speaks that thing into two or three or whatever it is one two or three depending on which
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0033591_0034574	one thing that we could probably skip totally is the remembering things from the audi files
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0049366_0049523	so it's definitely gonna be something
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0121631_0121738	yeah that's true
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0079506_0079643	oh
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0153441_0153811	oh
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0126896_0127147	well i mean
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0144532_0144657	okay okay
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0038837_0039136	oh we felt there were more important things to do with our time than
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0036226_0036472	they're in the confusion without the final report
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0064860_0065078	well yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0018395_0018519	you're gonna make sense
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0105335_0105452	yeah yeah i can remember
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0161799_0161936	maybe you could spread that up
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0039295_0039468	didn't work about a little bit
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0023745_0024214	but this is cut out the middle man you know just
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0048439_0048678	it's not gonna be difficult
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0175540_0175983	four four lines of whatever
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0159496_0159838	whether it runs out of memory
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0015441_0015688	yeah because i mean that's basically what we're doing here
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0028261_0028966	slapslapslap
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0154970_0155409	personally i don't wanna mess with writing or anything at the moment
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0079886_0080250	weekend was out
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0019391_0020010	but can you know it has screen screens by the thing each one or have just a bunch of them in one section
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0174099_0174290	oh
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0113936_0114207	so a knife
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0036594_0036788	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0005954_0006231	and i should just do that as well
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0043505_0043786	that's right
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0146289_0147004	you hafta start defending object models the right thing and getting over the weird things
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0025379_0025658	yeah well i mean it's up to you if you wanna keep going with that
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0042719_0042856	yeah put it good
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0013926_0014135	where's it
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0115533_0115991	three nice octopus i think
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0083471_0083998	like just if they check all three say total number of words have three different words come up
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0065078_0065557	well it doesn't really matter you mean right the sentence is first as well
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0119968_0120335	it's i thought we were just going to have that as words
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0049534_0049781	yeah we won't make it disappear but we might thin it down a bit
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0163194_0163417	so he took me back to speech therapy and he said we were done with that
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0123311_0123783	oh see what we want just take certain
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0093080_0093213	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0163985_0164101	goes or something
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0059749_0059852	okay
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0090755_0090862	all of them
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0057891_0058016	yeah exactly
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0125458_0125580	it says something different
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0100175_0100452	and then we're high lighting something in a truck
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0041920_0042435	yeah yeah yeah we manage that nice
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0089859_0090212	yeah you know they're be two real real nice cinderella
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0046238_0046442	oh really
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0092178_0092282	yeah exactly
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0057650_0058070	five i mean we have now five but what about them
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0066537_0066801	well do this i'll do that's all falls together
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0114909_0115049	you know
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0066825_0067239	how about the underlying disease for it
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0016792_0016898	it's not something after
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0151881_0152103	that's what programming is all about i'm afraid
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0150688_0151137	seems to be more interesting to use it as a real development project
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0093213_0093492	mean we could order them by meeting for example
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0054833_0054945	alright
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0050130_0050484	yeah they might turn out easier than thought
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0090405_0090683	yeah i quite like the area of tap in that case
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0123113_0123303	so as as opposed to
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0101260_0101496	so that's that's yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0144261_0144569	even trying to read it and ex
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0125531_0125664	yeah i know
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0026675_0027547	well look at it when my usual working hours are from twelve o'clock to three o'clock or something
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0113476_0113968	okay maybe i should use that as well in my yeah okay
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0178273_0178394	for those that are right yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0055312_0055519	that's exactly the same as it was
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0065912_0066273	and also sometimes it's a bit of a motivating factor too
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0170405_0170552	and
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0124313_0124485	at the moment it prince out of them
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0043351_0043505	yeah that's that's true
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0051348_0051744	just needs to be done yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0114147_0114464	oh no i'm sure it doesn't go pain in it
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0131598_0131725	and thus she wanted to dance
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0105878_0106013	oh oh yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0040496_0041100	and i think we should probably continue especially on the mall stores as well and say we manage to do
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0164255_0164357	oh maybe
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0115049_0115317	knock it over
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0042801_0043608	well i don't know
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0118130_0118569	the removing the diseases if you done anything with that yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0031418_0031794	and i'll send it out to you again or whatever
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0044331_0044624	oh it's plenty
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0174493_0174669	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0019159_0019391	yeah you know i have yes brain scan and stuff
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0080142_0080966	yeah so if you're all the other stuff out there that okay i'm gonna try minimize the amount of change i make
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0105080_0105308	at that point that's sort of where it starts getting a little bit trick
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0145518_0145969	yeah well it was just so complicated
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0063436_0063952	have an image in my mind and i just wanna see it on the thing and then get nice screen shot
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0086046_0086485	and i know we still wanna keep it that way but that's that's what i'm gonna be working
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0125286_0125531	okay then that's that's not yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0175109_0175452	have you used my pen
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0084835_0085080	oh it you know
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0173304_0173568	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0090212_0090467	one for topps one for really tops
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0041160_0041286	there's this and this
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0160386_0160730	so should we all write a letter or two about future work as well
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0051551_0051685	two i guess they're good
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0044624_0045064	you don't have any apn pl pl pl sl
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0042609_0042719	yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0101936_0102270	and then there's some if state machine saying straight on the you know
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0173660_0174199	and crack back anything that i thought was wrong in the english language
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0035738_0036107	it's a good thing what we could have done if we had more time
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0136024_0136232	but i mean that's that's you know fancy but
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0140536_0140696	there's lots of his stories
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0035060_0035247	so i don't think so either yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0096204_0096458	should be an easy one
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0054353_0054961	that's what he entered that we should also investigate who who's responsible for what from now on
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0051744_0052069	searched through the parameters because man or something
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0096458_0096585	should be fairly easy
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0169707_0170268	you know
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0098797_0099022	the returns to two different courses
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0078221_0078524	once since you looked at it last no
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0044380_0044595	and she's
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0140401_0140531	oops
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0153855_0154032	have a friend too
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0136952_0137075	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0054984_0055312	well i could probably just copy that straight out of the other one as well
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0021977_0022293	otherwise no
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0088442_0088847	have three separate windows with the three different types of windows
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0058775_0059373	yeah we just keep it together on the paper there right now and just see what
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0018361_0018535	yeah can't either have or we can just enjoy that
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0106358_0106545	you you hafta use actions
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0145283_0145518	so we've done it with nice stuff too
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0173065_0173652	and then send it on to us so that we can know
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0058351_0058470	oh
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0014850_0015021	oh mean what what we're gonna put into that
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0078676_0078817	alright i see
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0082114_0082502	do you want separate reports for each of those
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0073145_0073437	and that'll tell you the start times at end times
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0050095_0050312	depends on how i
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0122353_0122857	mean i thought we we just selectively write the exclamation that we've gone
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0143963_0144215	oh so on the flip it's it's totally pretty
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0090855_0091354	but you wouldn't want to compare the resolution with one two three four five six
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0095959_0096134	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0058198_0058396	removing these
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0143373_0143725	and then that way we could even prove that before
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0029691_0030275	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0030488_0030619	so i'll send it off to you
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0022293_0022953	did someone else one actually can probably still try it together if you want
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0029133_0029280	yeah right
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0175479_0175581	oh
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0032249_0032460	well here's the old one
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0052069_0052298	and see what happens
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0155409_0155526	one i wanna do it super fancy
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0168547_0168840	and then one to talk about
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0164930_0165079	yeah maybe alright
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0176873_0177267	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0037935_0038266	but put it under changes since the initial specification
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0067962_0068274	yeah but i'll work on it
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0055240_0055341	yeah pretty much
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0108601_0108763	you know
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0124801_0124917	okay yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0112478_0112878	and that comes with the whole lot of writing exercises as well
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0020888_0020992	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0129704_0130120	but things are like well how would we describe the like if we do this one and just you know
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0085039_0085733	what i think what we sort of discuss last week was to have it sort on the same window
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0016426_0016728	and so just saying that you know we could potentially do that
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0134416_0135016	you can do it together with with the the construction with the original construction and have them run parallel
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0123720_0124313	yeah only one person out certain certain sentences the second sentence is the second one just selective
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0021313_0021454	yes
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0115367_0115504	yeah why
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0032772_0033027	yeah yeah which's just coffee straight out
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0109010_0109145	what do you mean it could work with anything
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0095288_0095598	so yeah that kind of makes sense
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0153316_0153441	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0106024_0106677	so there are ways around it but you know whether i'll be able to figure something out like that till before tomorrow yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0061780_0062365	and i found finally today something that i can build it in and it i should have something for tomorrow
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0157089_0157402	if it's fast enough on the fly then sure
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0015184_0015707	we're gonna be touching on all that during the other part for the program and putting screen shots and all that rest yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0059383_0059545	have you taken any more of a look at it
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0138548_0138826	so but i mean you know
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0066273_0066537	and he write down the words and the ideas and oh okay
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0049161_0049366	that's gonna be no work at all
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0108763_0109120	and i think that was
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0142837_0143107	it's been been couple years since i've looked at anything like this
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0172091_0172338	doesn't matter for me either
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0004495_0004612	and she goes with the umbrella
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0002480_0002851	who wants to take notes today
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0041286_0041566	or some of them were a bit later than others yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0146180_0146289	don't believe it
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0130967_0131486	less we extract that out of the file when we create the text file
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0024443_0024853	and i'm being like i don't speak english
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0020992_0021379	we're writing the textbook and everything
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0068805_0069665	but if any of you guys know how you could do the from the exact words that you did
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0088240_0088442	what have you confused me
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0074908_0075230	the the the the object is a normal right object
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0099946_0100175	it's hard to tell whether it was a a transcript or whatever
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0100452_0101260	it may be difficult to get that information back once it's just in a little
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0178394_0178659	it was very nice you know
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0081248_0081582	actually just to clarify file last week when we're talking about our church resolutions
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0171165_0171447	or or she can take it from now
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0057415_0057650	so we i mean no yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0038504_0038624	we don't think there's enough time
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0077969_0078306	because i'm sure you've probably made some changes already
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0015897_0016426	well it was just something that he had mentioned in the in the previous have a project together
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0032386_0032508	oh that's more
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0030110_0030238	alright
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0149202_0149408	been nice to just sort of see what they're doing
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0058979_0059114	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0124485_0124910	well just put in a little bit that leaves out some of the prince's
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0026408_0026889	you can prefer it and
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0074139_0074374	so i could just put it in some
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0111480_0111676	so i'm not sure what it's called now
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0048322_0048580	probably we want it yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0004240_0004381	well take note of this time i guess
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0164018_0164192	yeah yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0155864_0156372	the thing that was going on is that once it's done for you know one meeting it's done and it's there
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0037097_0037360	yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0122144_0122353	why why we wanna it in exale
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0158182_0158649	it's if it's loading the file and doing all the rest and progressing them
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0027852_0028436	it always make me feel bad because when i go to bed one you know
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0094088_0094233	well that's a horse too
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0050861_0051348	the top secret moment with elisa singing totally basically done
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0084627_0084835	oh it's a second resolve
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0117869_0117982	with the
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0091831_0092168	especially if you get results for the same meeting
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0118453_0118825	yeah but the okay the global one feeding into the local
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0047777_0048030	that would be the easiest way to
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0187875_0188443	yeah just to give them an idea of what is and so they can pick a a meeting
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0055476_0055829	then i could use that for the top pop up window
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0249998_0250371	well three of us have class twelve
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0249215_0249491	maybe i'm not sure i'm doing this again
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0254887_0254996	okay
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0023520_0024002	so i i have your ready collection of this date or what are you sposta do that
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0005496_0005698	yes
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0079726_0079893	you mean the high lighting stuff
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0252592_0252753	you know five six
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0053683_0053812	oh yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0099083_0099438	well it's then umbrella
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0134197_0134354	oh they do they research them
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0225023_0225259	oh let's see
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0197610_0198058	besides what they did the last time
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0140243_0140790	if somebody's done the the the the i dfs already would mean not too very bad
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0213265_0213415	oh i see what you mean
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0025463_0025733	and then oh you're going one at a time to practice that window
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0103783_0103949	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0070272_0070386	it's good
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0124048_0124307	ten different meetings you know the word wire is comes up
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0051055_0051227	umbrella umbrella
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0235796_0236117	cut it right across
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0127554_0128257	you know the operation is to do a surgery in the way that if you do a global surgery
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0287945_0288070	take
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0237959_0238103	it tells you what
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0278313_0278617	we're just looking for the two words separately to see if they exist in the same document
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0201912_0202445	and i mean just playing around with ideas
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0028802_0028920	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0282399_0282559	oh how do you write them or something
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0147353_0147533	well the cop's yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0265828_0266434	oh but for things like if you search for language then you might have you have some topics which have as
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0184560_0184752	okay
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0213415_0213551	inside the sandwich yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0157347_0157497	yeah yeah definitely
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0069110_0069420	well i won't take very long to get it over finished
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0125139_0125328	it's not too bad on that
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0103036_0103596	at the moment the way is it's a drop down menu as you see
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0057373_0057710	the a lot of people don't give their age and on the stuff
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0099438_0100082	it's some some speech and music some trouble
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0068607_0068783	it's yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0088289_0089001	ten doctors or we can hafta do the individual next year's surgery
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0247021_0247144	but i mean it's right after
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0060210_0060321	so it doesn't cross the thing
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0090150_0090373	oh i'm sorry
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0049224_0049723	so each time you're going straight to the excel file for for the information or or
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0176931_0177652	but if the ex tc search is still got to run to find these terms or these you know these patterns then
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0042950_0043546	because at the moment i'm using for other things
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0236758_0236869	oh really
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0149838_0149964	versus talking
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0164818_0164960	yeah okay
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0160488_0160600	running it one side down
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0053812_0053941	but you know
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0109093_0109356	can you get this name object
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0223637_0223889	oh i was thinking
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0255898_0256003	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0050258_0050422	okay
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0132681_0132824	but better names for the movies
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0225317_0225963	yeah i'm not sure what it's that very is that not knowing if you have to hold him you know
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0047715_0047843	yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0050561_0050671	yes i remember
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0208441_0208990	just said one and said take me straight to this meeting and have a text book you can introduce it or whatever
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0218519_0218657	and case like that we do on top of the tree
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0174008_0174408	and that generally we'll be a bit crude but it'll give you a score
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0272402_0272761	yeah i mean you you just do it really simple you know
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0053116_0053476	or it's just one one object for okay
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0028342_0028849	mean surgery if they're all in a private thing with a name certain
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0226994_0227437	wave for the whole bunch of that one
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0044823_0045043	and the same for that
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0256612_0256834	yeah no we should probably do that at the end
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0203527_0203630	then do this umbrella
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0118903_0119072	yeah mean the whole

AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0162209_0162322	curb
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0130824_0131060	yeah that makes sense

AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0098398_0098686	what kind of story do we want
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0063528_0063805	thought the other stuff was more important anyway so i did that first
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0281597_0281750	yeah i think so
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0241644_0241921	but really just can't keep on going
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0069766_0069924	because otherwise the exact won't be the same
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0200239_0200457	what was that
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0135159_0135296	love that
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0268832_0269419	for multiple times and thus she wanna do something there will be a way of doing it for a long time
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0168814_0168924	oh i don't know
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0119439_0119572	yeah

AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0172193_0172508	and then then it's just saying where these two words in in any of these documents
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0198795_0199338	well alright okay
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0228698_0229192	maybe just leave it just have them leaving names there and don't worry about the
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0135332_0135852	yeah okay i wanna see the movie
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0260848_0261428	well basically not not on less you got time for at the end
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0138314_0138521	mean the days
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0161177_0161402	yeah yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0089380_0089533	yeah i think probably
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0061353_0061562	because they just for the meet the the
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0281671_0281788	oh
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0171413_0171547	how do you combine that question
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0150429_0150823	did do it once i do have a golf course that does it for something i don't know whether it's worth it or not
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0208152_0208271	oh well yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0133108_0133838	we can probably do that ourselves and just do a a string guitar you know
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0167133_0167654	basically all of the meetings you wanna see where that she spoke about it and where they just mentioned at once
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0258709_0259136	we discussed if the sentence should be written
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0157189_0157624	because you don't hafta invest as much yes
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0131060_0131406	and that way if they know specifically which meaning it is and they'll say the time
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0070656_0070793	that's my whole therapy
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0181729_0181889	if you haven't gone it's on kootenay
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0274286_0274539	because something you're gonna get a lot of results
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0021965_0022709	and you can write the write the write the write the write the journal and they those return objects have all the information that they need
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0134278_0134441	yeah yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0143784_0144054	well it was would've been like a little bit of
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0140160_0140436	well think it's if it's been done there was
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0188405_0188759	church for stuff for
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0105765_0105892	yeah that kind of makes sense
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0230548_0230731	yeah yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0203630_0203968	so you know sort of you know guided me
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0149086_0149296	bench bench
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0248492_0248785	forty minutes
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0042237_0042339	the one present okay
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0061822_0062225	the speech class knows about all of that stuff and the music class knows about that stuff
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0254517_0254873	alright this meeting up and i'll send it to pennsylvania as well
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0213571_0214400	so the only thing that comes up when you start it's just one window like that and it's gone the search stuff like that down there
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0171739_0172055	the period each word in the the end
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0103596_0104380	with all the and that because it's it's the dialogue class that you use there
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0273228_0273333	can you describe it
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0205682_0205884	oh no well that's not what i'm suggesting
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0162322_0162464	it's true
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0072563_0073206	what are you gonna write that directly or what what do you wanna do with that
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0248688_0248940	or three three o'clock
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0161826_0162209	yeah i wasn't sure if it was
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0151721_0151946	because if you just have the second one that's great
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0203968_0204271	and it's like hey my task is to do this and there's a button for it
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0199722_0200105	yeah it's not enough information is it
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0034640_0034795	yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0251707_0251921	if one's bad for you then we want okay
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0002066_0002306	oops
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0104515_0104905	as just can ask if we should assume that they're gonna lose a meeting first but not necessarily
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0160264_0160488	yeah but that went slowly down
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0195904_0196265	like if they're part of ex work group they're gonna get in there
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0175914_0176170	or we choose the list of movies that we wanted to see that
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0242860_0243033	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0054355_0054561	it tells you who participates
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0241212_0241619	write so anyway so one and one's saying
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0199005_0199280	yeah okay alright
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0264093_0264561	if if they're looking for like i say sunny day and
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0138712_0139019	do actually need the the fractures
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0200585_0200849	oh i forget
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0169308_0169412	as it come around now
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0050993_0051116	you hafta recover the object
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0165350_0165897	but the thing is we're just looking for when it happens in a meeting if they're looking for a particular term or something
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0207407_0207598	yeah as well
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0144032_0144273	it's the around that they care over and over
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0235971_0236358	you've got lots of numb something and then end something
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0138687_0138799	well can i
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0173224_0174008	yes he's doing some of the the individual tv for each term and returned
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0090305_0090583	but it can't do them if it thinks it won
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0184287_0185068	so to come back to the stroke group i'm i'm i'm very sure about what that should look like
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0175414_0175908	if it's all going to go into the n x y z
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0134088_0134278	yeah the long names
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0103440_0103544	alright
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0193944_0194339	because we we just wanna have a way of you know
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0147775_0147937	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0260094_0260376	it's just progress
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0075245_0075906	but i was going up date that one just because yeah it just make sense that then you can tell it yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0161107_0161604	it's still uses in the video but it rings the resolve by the the high yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0016779_0017338	oh okay when you talk to me speech therapy how are we doing
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0217577_0217753	well we don't actually have use our names do we
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0239098_0239480	so you ended up just saying it returns and ten books
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0136433_0136556	okay that's good
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0126076_0126392	tested tried some and then shut it up
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0238529_0238836	yeah this is an interesting
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0230731_0230930	that's nice and easy
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0205757_0205864	alright
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0106524_0106641	oh
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0271599_0271853	oh yeah yeah oh yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0220084_0220230	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0220248_0220721	but that's that's true that's two
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0237892_0238062	oh
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0238062_0238529	and most of the descriptions are high to each other saying you've gotta up date this journal
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0209594_0209856	yeah oh one yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0183640_0183894	yeah that's okay that's okay that's okay
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0251001_0251148	well yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0112036_0112390	one one then they would open the meeting first right
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0221165_0221415	and he can go for go for the other
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0281256_0281671	so that's that's the whole thing
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0287732_0287850	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0054132_0054324	well
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0175908_0176137	so yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0207616_0207937	but i mean the main thing what you wanna do is to vote on a meeting right
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0065949_0066289	if i gave you it now and you worked on it
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0248492_0248671	oh
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0254165_0254342	but i don't think that will be
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0182591_0182876	yeah what was yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0166691_0167133	you if if you search for language and you return like you know
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0229367_0229594	it's not the same as doing a quick exercise
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0010398_0010516	so how we getting along
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0246596_0246706	possibly i don't know
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0031695_0032375	so it can either come back as a vegetable and it will say news
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0264931_0265179	or i don't know
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0082847_0083407	they've got use of high lights collection high lights time high lights and
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0146188_0146938	so if you so the more it occurs in special occasions a little bit more important it is about the
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0179386_0179709	that's yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0130271_0130817	yeah make it springs as for as long as possible and then until you return the things when it needs to hasta series
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0199684_0200295	yeah it's not like they come back every day and do the same thing
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0199338_0199448	you could have a vehicle
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0101760_0101866	hmhm
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0270631_0270975	or you could you could personnel it he could just put a weight against it
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0229882_0230290	it's just nice to have some basic information on on each of the meetings
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0180329_0180467	actually that's good work yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0181393_0181581	maybe in a few minutes
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0191972_0192304	row's by meeting rows by row by speaker
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0230659_0230821	and then that doesn't get in the way
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0246706_0246996	usually by then so needed a break
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0207456_0207592	yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0169607_0169964	one just like egg and bread and language oh
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0272028_0272402	yeah just just just just recovered yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0075146_0075269	okay yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0116826_0117456	so i'm just thinking if it's kinda like you're saying you hafta have a normal object right
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0180351_0180980	well it's there's a whole lot about it
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0033810_0034240	oh what the easiest thing to do how you wanna describe it
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0147825_0148187	yeah so the general one is
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0158525_0158712	oh do you need two
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0186781_0187146	but then that's probably pretty much the same for the same group
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0274023_0274217	it doesn't hafta be all interesting
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0027954_0028342	actually even the surgeries or whatever you know just any sort of thing
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0216096_0216266	yeah that looks about right
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0065605_0065949	it would become out of sentence and get bit funny
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0161402_0161533	that would just be nice extra
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0278617_0278907	if they do then there's a possibility that they could
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0187627_0187906	went down on the staircase yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0077597_0078132	so and then you can play
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0147937_0148548	but plus a bunch of stuff so you remove stuff and then there which is gonna have a pretty basically easy school
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0025733_0026149	but that's what i wanted to know how how what form do you want the date to come back
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0215704_0216048	and the the top it's as well to welcome to our world
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0250419_0250544	how about quite
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0111239_0111597	because we don't wanna search locally we want to search globally
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0030913_0031695	so it's got the speech and then it's got the sentence for that thing
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0052355_0052804	then you roll and you can roll and roll and whatever one or all of them
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0198689_0198979	if you wanna look at five meetings
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0057730_0058078	because at the moment she right click on the top window on one of the top
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0087170_0087588	you're loading like a new corps each time for each meeting but you're doing the exercises
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0280998_0281269	so i don't know what what's doing
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0181928_0182058	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0172508_0173238	and then if was then we go close and do the necropolis to look for the exact year's church to to look for the exact year's church
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0041734_0041973	is it possible by the one present or the one hired
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0259469_0259873	there's just sort of the basic information stuff that i was wondering about
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0193761_0193944	oh i don't think we need that yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0190217_0190360	yeah oh yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0017338_0017486	that i want to do about that she
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0071909_0072240	just load this one instead of the the the
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0092783_0092912	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0204383_0204496	you know
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0078938_0079543	yeah and just to hire in the the
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0205719_0206009	just a second
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0118825_0119318	so for getting any useable date it's it's gonna be doing a search on each of those files
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0061553_0062005	oh so that that is all started together
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0176617_0176931	it's gonna give us something cool then yeah absolutely
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0078818_0078938	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0076114_0076300	yeah and then up date
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0270757_0270985	well but you still hafta do the science
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0209471_0209691	yeah that's the easiest sort of thing
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0026808_0026979	actually i know that might also help
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0153001_0153109	see you next week
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0056609_0057022	or just turn it on or a blanket or something yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0235811_0235971	oh yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0090583_0091142	because then it's about the amount that each if you hafta kind of cool a new class and then it will do fine
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0058924_0059029	yeah yeah that'll be a problem
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0236358_0236513	and ex tc something like that
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0271683_0271921	so if you how many pairs of you can
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0227691_0227942	and just you know i wanna look for this woman
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0135999_0136107	see if it's accurate
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0172055_0172193	well that's way we're thinking about it
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0274305_0274557	well that's sort of what it's yeah that's true
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0011623_0012020	like if you're in the top and it goes high like the top in the tree or whatever
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0134666_0134793	okay alright
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0167571_0168186	but if it's a two word term doesn't the
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0277014_0277640	the if sunny and day don't mention together a lot but sunny just happens to be one of the ones
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0062708_0063054	so have you done these yet
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0026783_0026961	what's easiest to describe on the graph
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0044062_0044474	so that we call that and call the meetings and stuff that kind of thing
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0063800_0063948	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0264561_0264931	yeah sunny shows up in this department day shows up but they're not together
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0047031_0047163	so you want me to do that then
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0256327_0256480	oh that's somebody was collecting them
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0227076_0227367	yeah that's true
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0274873_0275008	it's just push it up
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0216811_0217577	because we dropped down mexico but we want the information about the name the long name and the use of it
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0149964_0150187	the term refers to various cooking recipes
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0078579_0078992	so that what you're working on now to to present the results nice or
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0083866_0084550	so you can quite easily if your text area is cold air just do air dot set high lights or something you know
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0281996_0282399	so yeah if you return the seventy five why where you stop
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0148964_0149212	the bunch of kids were
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0030576_0030860	one two three four five six seven eight
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0107714_0107884	and if it doesn't load then four of them to load one
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0069420_0069766	but only i needta have done all of this stuff too first
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0026149_0026783	because it can come back as most anything
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0158712_0159014	oh for for year stuff i guess yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0074876_0075176	oh i have a copy yes
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0250371_0250565	could go but one
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0288070_0288203	it's tied off already
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0197378_0197509	oh how how we gonna know that
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0147303_0147608	of course the cop's the
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0131880_0132180	so yeah or they could check mark against the ones they wanted to check
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0009179_0009353	just saying the same things as you just said
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0160737_0161085	maybe but the general internet
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0027329_0027798	so the things are all magical i mean it would be good idea if we use that same idea for anything else we do
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0277942_0278075	if you're even out of them together
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0051305_0051769	so what you do is you call the number because if you call the proper contact for each meeting
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0193671_0193905	or we could keep it more general
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0233878_0233998	umbrella
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0076744_0076902	so no
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0210117_0210615	basically either the use of what knows which meeting you want to look at
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0253648_0254165	then if three o'clock a problem five six well be a problem because i won't be here
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0281344_0281597	oh yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0071484_0071909	actually i can upload myself as well i just hafta make one change to your file
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0050140_0050561	they're only one one okay
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0035962_0036317	see that's the key how we you know i like it again
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0280821_0280998	well right now i'm not doing anything
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0242621_0243025	friday afternoon or something
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0200457_0200585	that's it
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0204271_0204383	oh perfect
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0149632_0149922	actually what's the i and tiff
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0204433_0204785	now that's the
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0162242_0162710	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0255359_0256031	because she's not here
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0182876_0183163	do the pee tests and then
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0186624_0186781	uses that took part
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0153454_0154048	and instead of it we would just search for key words and when they you tell me they're trying to understand the topic
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0223687_0224067	oh
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0058078_0058747	you have the operation of putting open a window which gives you a little bit of the meeting continuing that type of
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0039137_0039381	oh it was a big thing
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0124992_0125139	it's not too slow though i don't think
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0130817_0130921	one when it needs to be loaded
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0195627_0195904	what are the things that they wanna do
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0061042_0061259	you know it's yeah for the club
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0032977_0033810	you know you could have a an event or a a party or whatever
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0180210_0180351	oh yes it there's lots in the literature
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0274539_0274873	and if the one that you got just happened to be the bottom one
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0121255_0121388	because otherwise you cross the thing
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0158716_0158970	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0223959_0224134	two
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0002541_0002756	you
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0018397_0019186	if if you wanna do that then then tell me how you wanna do that
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0104905_0105239	yeah i guess they're doing a church on the corner
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0102381_0102717	love me meeting love me some
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0158970_0159494	oh no but that's what the area was in the first place to write write the records so that
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0024593_0025389	which means you're just cool the and all no construct and call the load thing and cool that and that you can create a list of them or whatever you wanna do
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0093795_0093898	hmhm
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0212516_0213348	or but the second window could have on it something that said as a dropped down money that says just
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0261426_0262136	well i i kinda think it would complicated things quite a bit and not bring us a lot
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0081159_0081352	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0100590_0100987	but no or something that just sort of guides them to the most obvious things
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0257021_0257501	so can you just repeat quickly what we've been about
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0114127_0114868	then at that point they're like if you want it by default goes with the first one and they want number five of the ones that are returned
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0210971_0211077	fit it's right
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0028672_0028802	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0267660_0268069	you know my language is german or something
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0200922_0201065	okay
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0169412_0169892	funny yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0004764_0005099	they're gonna take the
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0189594_0190013	if they know exactly where they wanna go you know that meeting on december third
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0253216_0253648	it's it's say three o'clock and then if there's a problem with that
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0018522_0018869	yeah i i was thinking about i was going that direction anyway
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0170303_0170774	it's my simple form it would do separate write for each one each time
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0262837_0263091	like if someone's looking for a particular term
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0066787_0067293	and then you have a multiple copy of objects to play with over the place and get silly i think
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0107270_0107714	five i could probably even that's should be too hard to put a check in there
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0021812_0021965	and they're they're too different objects
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0063948_0064594	so it's all all useful now can i do it tonight
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0255144_0255359	oh
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0179940_0180210	how you come back
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0251571_0252344	that would only give us thirty five minutes or something
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0005698_0005937	it was a giveaway prize
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0238373_0238569	yeah but oh thank you
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0099959_0100154	it doesn't take too long though
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0143830_0144030	what is tf i've done for
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0050671_0050993	and then it's just each month the objectives
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0068569_0068860	it doesn't matter
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0111483_0111596	yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0221477_0221637	he's gone byebye
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0141729_0142205	but it had sort of all that standard sort of stuff but it last last i heard it wasn't working
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0132245_0132471	did we think about
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0282773_0282891	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0108922_0109064	but you want
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0121424_0121743	well i'm just thinking of anyway you know
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0010769_0011623	one thing that i was wondering is is it's standard control that you use to connect the different things
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0017486_0018262	the day practice is fine but i would don't typically wanna do the the the the the gym for it
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0111938_0112083	well alright
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0109743_0110080	but you hafta start with something for some reason
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0052649_0052811	oh
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0271367_0271506	yeah yeah i know
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0128257_0128525	first as first step only return the meetings
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0185068_0185739	we mean for the part where you can choose choose the the meeting what kind of information you wanna have about meeting
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0265179_0265811	it just doesn't you're looking for that term and relatives because if the term shows up it shows up
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0105197_0105814	mean i think they should have two options either load up a meeting that they choose or do a search
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0244908_0245011	for next week yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0234538_0234956	it's a nice object
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0050422_0050663	it's all just repeat and just okay
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0236930_0237076	oh
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0199280_0199424	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0176137_0176267	yeah yeah that's true
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0178851_0179386	yeah i don't know how that
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0162464_0162631	so it's only introduction
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0281142_0281256	it's not that many meetings
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0168924_0169280	just something like eighty percent
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0277640_0277942	the it's time will be low and you'll push down the other one if you combine them
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0099910_0100194	it's some administration talking to me
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0165897_0166317	they're gonna know if that term exists and where does it exist and what one to see it you know
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0196786_0197287	well if they're part of a busy bee working group they're gonna wanna look at the busy bee ones and so on and so forth
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0281067_0281627	yeah yeah but they're all seventy five meetings
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0244241_0244628	so do you wanna arrive this get this one earlier maybe
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0063054_0063276	just go to decide on what we wanna
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0176403_0176608	but
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0256480_0256648	well that's what i thought when you said that
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0042347_0042747	oh three though we could do the one high ladder i suppose
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0209467_0209594	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0085892_0086548	see just a few more things to do with that and then one's principal gets the the index
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0091133_0091466	oh i like that one more room or whatever
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0247460_0247646	good for that
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0269500_0269766	well crickets you know
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0106173_0106536	you needta have a learning lesson before you start doing anything
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0233998_0234346	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0060366_0060622	so how would you how would you collaborate that
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0024199_0024593	and we'll start with objects so
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0034863_0035710	so whatever we open a window for one speaker
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0039278_0039458	okay
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0076902_0077102	you'll just make that one and listen
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0139748_0140090	mean you think you'd have have time for that as well
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0129236_0129671	then it gives you as a result all the meetings that continue the wedding
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0117710_0117866	yeah but lookeach
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0064279_0064838	the problem is if you change the clothes

AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0089041_0089444	that way it doesn't cross over
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0119572_0120392	but yeah the the globe envelope falls apart gives the nomo gives the long sword right
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0117456_0117835	and mean before you do a search it all on this
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0266434_0267224	you know some some meetings which have as a topic language they speak about language and they use that word in every sentence
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0208257_0208441	so even if it just had two things
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0212121_0212516	and then that brings up the brother after he search for something
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0214400_0214615	so this is your sentence
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0053540_0053686	oh each meeting okay
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0093287_0093764	well i've been doing some running up and down stairs for the exercise
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0219180_0219359	okay
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0019778_0020295	the environment about both is continuing and the environment about both is continuing
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0121092_0121255	but he gives one at a time anyway
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0039381_0039876	where did these people come from
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0197755_0197983	oh have you
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0272761_0273228	you have the resources as before but yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0065272_0065398	and and i haven't quite finished yet
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0006711_0006820	okay okay
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0080874_0081304	so it goes in and high lights because that's
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0240638_0240914	yeah it's driving me crazy
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0048565_0048700	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0224950_0225317	very yeah very
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0233769_0233929	and i i think
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0279167_0279738	but you have no ranking system at the moment so if something's of an amazing thing from a little bit
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0163798_0164155	because i mean then then it would give you like if you search for a word
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0194339_0195069	because as soon as they got located their first meeting they can they can brush through that quite nicely
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0190360_0191168	well i wanna look at the meeting where so so so
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0216813_0216963	jump jumped down there
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0046899_0047044	yeah yeah that would be easy as well yes
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0278040_0278313	well the things i mean that'll be exactly how we're doing it now
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0243115_0243612	mean i think i'm gonna do quite a bit of work this week so i have probably more to do
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0068232_0068607	you mean just the yeah but it's not gonna take very long
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0203619_0203867	oh alright oh okay
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0061027_0061353	what the world statistics come straight out of that
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0063289_0063528	what what yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0256003_0256253	go for the gift
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0038476_0038941	the the environment for six months don't know if that had any effect
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0230807_0230954	yeah maybe that's the best idea
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0187258_0187797	for the most part i mean they're be a set of people that do then a subset for each meeting probably
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0123539_0123775	and we're gonna hafta have all that other day there
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0240763_0241021	yeah i hope definitely
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0020295_0020877	so and then they write write write all the information about the meetings and the speakers
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0057141_0057373	there's a little one and then there are some four on one side and then there's another four on the other side
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0217344_0217656	oh you want i to use it
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0250517_0250815	we say three o'clock and then if there's a serious problem
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0123043_0123539	if it's trying to show us where those are if it's trying to hide those
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0181530_0181646	okay okay
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0235175_0235508	yeah yeah it's right cool yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0115184_0115431	well like to load up the thing is i think
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0185739_0186339	mean the the the the longer name obviously if there's one because they don't all have long names
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0244907_0245123	well we can describe it on friday if we have one
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0171385_0171739	because the thing is that the way we were doing it we were just looking for the words
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0159909_0160355	because enoxia over the whole of the course was just not feasible
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0234696_0234930	oh yes
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0260376_0260692	we we decide whether it's be rented
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0091884_0092582	oh
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0084903_0085417	that's the way i did it to to right across right between two trees
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0249187_0249353	there you go
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0174408_0174774	and the more important each term is for each thing we'd give you
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0136130_0136376	so i put that in already too
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0064838_0065272	it the executive decides he can't relocate the office to the present location
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0120772_0120979	yeah that's always gonna be the case
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0158504_0158755	yeah that's what i'm thinking too yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0234025_0234141	hmhm
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0059029_0059346	and then you do the sentence over the questions
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0166295_0166492	but it's how how important
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0163365_0163504	oh yeah yes time
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0070898_0071135	one on one hand side not okay
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0237498_0237773	the area's alright but there's a lot of destruction
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0147621_0147931	well you might have some general exercises
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0188759_0189152	or or
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0228112_0228471	and then it pulls up a list of all the ones who got that
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0016228_0016669	like other texts or what we're gonna do for speech i guess and all the rest right
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0263091_0263526	just i just don't know if it would bring us that much
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0073552_0074028	yeah but do you wanna change that the original umbrella five then
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0139344_0139509	to see the top leg
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0283566_0283669	went at time and
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0027798_0027954	oh what else are you doing
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0272131_0272336	yeah so then just push next
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0056071_0056435	but that would be a problem with everything that wasn't adequate for topics
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0034053_0034342	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0275434_0275852	and then we could actually put that like on the list of meetings that get returned
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0169675_0169803	or sunny day
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0273225_0273883	because we are using that i mean it does make sense for that but yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0198418_0198689	but that would defy the whole point of buying right
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0005327_0005656	did you get seven out of ten for the
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0135077_0135305	oh well that's the working group
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0048166_0048640	so yeah running things like just like return taking time
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0126975_0127464	but he doesn't take that long either time then it's alright
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0014626_0014856	so you should probably look at the
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0066289_0066787	and then i changed it and run the thing again and wouldn't be able to
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0101016_0101819	so do we want yeah maybe we could write and on the whatever it's called the the top of the window saying welcome to the meeting room
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0106555_0106792	well we can put the logic in there yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0260692_0260798	oh
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0156222_0157189	the easy but probably easiest way to calculate them based on in the courses then it is to calculate them past and forward
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0071077_0071212	now i don't put it go away
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0125328_0125523	don't think that it'll be too much of a problem
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0209821_0210117	yeah that all happens with the sentence basically
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0053919_0054132	unless that would be useful for some other stuff we're doing
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0248940_0249187	or you wanna get out
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0050910_0051055	okay okay
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0091142_0091801	but if you don't then it says okay oh yeah i've got all this speech you can use
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0106846_0106986	oh just
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0224556_0224692	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0251379_0251707	you know probably not
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0055903_0056071	yeah if that wouldn't be too good
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0168416_0168525	umbrella umbrella
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0252344_0252592	oh well i was quite late
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0229192_0229367	if they do in speech they do in sentence
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0078233_0078625	but if you get better resolve like better proceed
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0110675_0110886	the engine class only has one sister
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0071212_0071434	went back and finished up a little on the other side
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0222777_0223344	and then he gives you the long arm umbrella and then he gives you the you know the patient's
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0077311_0077597	because yeah like i say two lines of code if that
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0090063_0090305	he can do that fine
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0153109_0153454	but he could do key words to be the same thing
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0171103_0171347	and then out of those
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0032689_0032977	it will say a vegetable
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0135734_0135923	the
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0208271_0208431	and both of those we have him
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0139058_0139344	yeah to do what you
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0208096_0208257	yes yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0146883_0147426	so the general scope of that be for the whole of the language
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0243877_0244106	and we want to have the meeting with firstnames on tuesday
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0258117_0258709	we've mentioned public building with key words
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0138521_0138764	the documentation for each word you know
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0177584_0178053	yeah without doing any work path which is just a mess
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0184522_0184819	oh what's sort of
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0021528_0021812	so it's two separate courses you know me
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0134441_0134649	the the working group that it's part of
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0074114_0074311	well yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0023891_0024199	yes probably
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0172133_0172283	yeah they don't wanna start looking for me
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0182581_0182878	understand the
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0044963_0045399	mean that would be interesting what he said
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0270985_0271210	yeah still do the n x tc search then right
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0211248_0211482	just that opens and the second window opens
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0014333_0014626	but it has some sort of lighting stuff there
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0223369_0224053	you could do michigan style and it pops up a thing
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0218657_0218789	we don't want them to take them
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0268069_0268282	so you wanna dig in some
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0070452_0070695	is that the
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0161604_0161818	oh i thought that was part of it but yeah okay doesn't matter
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0259136_0259489	and firstnamem did you have anything else
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0082443_0082847	you're just look at the the what they wrote about it
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0093949_0094239	the windows are all there now after lots of fixing
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0271207_0271446	yeah you do the n c t and it doesn't
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0217753_0218050	and they're all these codes like mba eleven or whatever
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0283224_0283732	oh look through the window
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0180467_0180583	okay i'm
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0282559_0283107	or it turns twenty even if it turns twenty what's the trouble
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0123775_0124048	so each time when we have a church weekend and we have you know
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0060622_0061042	would you do the synthesis as you
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0221530_0222119	you know i'm not saying you can pick a use of it but it should come up with some
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0254414_0254517	but
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0107942_0108922	you could use the invitation to enter the meetings and then use one of those to lodge and search
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0023131_0023532	or everything but that's why i wanted to know how what's easiest way to have the date
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0038899_0039180	oh
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0049713_0050140	they practice a whole lot of line and then they're much more
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0078132_0078233	there's not much to do yet
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0252439_0252628	it's been a long time but
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0136797_0137361	so yeah again completely to the start up start up whatever it's window
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0198979_0199684	well you just crawl down the list and find your favorite one
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0234025_0234264	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0059346_0059579	because that's the thing these these are so small
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0099112_0099725	or is it more like
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0044474_0044823	and that would be and easy thing to do
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0021698_0021836	okay yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0118293_0118486	you can write the down one but doesn't have any
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0116003_0116206	alright now i think it's just the top ones
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0125539_0126076	it always seems to be slow loading up the first time at least like that's all i've been doing lately is just sort of loading up
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0036622_0037082	it's if it's in that form it's speaker
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0117866_0118149	we can do global research without anything
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0048700_0048948	get the time i think it's called in the morning or something like that yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0238946_0239111	oh yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0124688_0124836	next one
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0217831_0217942	it was just nice
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0272813_0273225	well we hafta talk to firstnamep about this then just because she's doing this
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0118131_0118293	it doesn't take long to load up anyway
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0140651_0140755	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0201065_0201541	well now i'm just getting back to the the start of the program
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0073336_0073698	well yeah just the one thing that's like the action for loading up the church
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0227367_0227691	but that's why you could just have a life of your own then
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0189349_0189594	like you're looking for something specific like that's what you're looking for
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0188748_0188875	yeah yeah i guess that's you
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0042122_0042347	the one present
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0218967_0219105	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0192679_0193086	like if they're looking for a particular person or whatever
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0039876_0040167	so then the whole that's catastrophic as well
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0112390_0113079	so say they have two options either pick one meeting or search globally to find a meeting that they like
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0271446_0271683	either disagree or put a weight on it
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0181581_0181729	they've got a good good character
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0235208_0235417	write a book or something
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0284081_0284542	but you wanna find the one that actually teaches it usely so
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0026456_0026737	what is she to come back in
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0166492_0166721	yeah yeah yeah it's an important story
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0163504_0163648	yeah nice to have
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0275852_0276514	if there were fifteen meetings with language languages and then it's gonna show you those and write them as to which is the
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0012020_0012646	is there one of these types of control that like it's or one two three four five six
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0164659_0164887	you know it'll be so easy
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0073206_0073320	if you wanna change my code
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0121743_0122317	just race the results and you know nice little form that'll make things a bit easier
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0086548_0086820	then that's kinda be kind of fun
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0041434_0041734	so then this is how's this box is popular
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0036517_0036622	okay
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0150779_0150892	alright
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0176267_0176403	so yeah that's less crude than that
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0253117_0253282	well three o'clock four
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0211482_0211798	and that's the interface and you just go from there
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0260798_0260979	for now oh well
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0250894_0251001	you could try roughly after
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0162977_0163392	but yeah i guess if that's not part of it i don't know
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0278907_0279111	and then we do the n e c s course on that document
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0271210_0271367	if it doesn't show up
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0097625_0098398	and i have a question about the we said we wanted to start school
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0022987_0023159	okay yeah see what you mean
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0282576_0282773	yeah twenty even it's twenty
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0275247_0275434	yeah okay so you're in the
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0240635_0240763	oh
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0111597_0111799	so so let's see
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0147426_0147543	okay okay
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0208990_0209204	and then other one that said search the ladder eventually
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0200295_0200898	let's see what's changed today
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0009745_0009928	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0076547_0076744	yeah i haven't made any changes to it yet
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0201541_0201912	like there's just a range of things we could have surgery
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0048868_0048973	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0167959_0168230	depends on the
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0062858_0063016	now i'm about anything you know
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0171523_0171710	you can just add them up or you can
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0006355_0006523	oh excellent
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0092912_0093190	spent too much time in front of it i think
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0210615_0211023	oh he doesn't and then he searches for one that sort of looks like
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0255501_0255898	oh i mean the she collecting oh right oh yes alright
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0232844_0233013	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0037768_0038191	so all of that's all that's okay is well i'm told to speak a little
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0038941_0039137	just spent too much time taking the bread
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0092196_0092783	it took you now isn't it
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0040167_0040336	well i hafta do this get the dog
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0022709_0023131	and then he can cool messes to return whenever you want
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0149507_0149838	yeah okay was three three five words
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0096059_0096200	okay
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0285850_0286022	well we'll discuss it again on friday
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0186339_0186624	what the uses that book
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0283425_0283566	and they feed them more and
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0225963_0226273	yeah yes
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0234815_0235146	but it's i think in that case it's the right course
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0054561_0055144	at the moment it says you participate in the amount they participate in time as well
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0283612_0284081	it would be useful as well for a word like word for a word in all of them
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0142825_0143125	but if we do need the frequencies then
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0263885_0264236	it i think it it would give you the most relevant response
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0246398_0246596	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0163648_0163764	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0131406_0131880	because i'm sure they don't wanna have the extra loading time neither if they can avoid it
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0062567_0062708	it's good
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0268426_0268832	yeah that would help a lot for that for single terms it would be very useful
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0120470_0120896	but it it could be time consuming if there are ten documents that hit with this
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0230290_0230807	yeah i'm thinking that that dates depending on what you've got high and low
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0230146_0230659	oh you can have text books there that go in that dates yeah as you go over them
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0197880_0198070	he can have a slice of bread
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0211013_0211248	well the other thing to do is just have search for the deer
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0051769_0052052	it goes off and does all the princess and stuff is fine
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0159488_0159909	so but then the main idea was more to to speak it up
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0249767_0249998	because she's got a class at eleven
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0238542_0238862	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0204529_0204737	oh i don't know
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0110808_0111239	as opposed to we wouldn't use encephalitis at the beginning anyway
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0141096_0141729	they did have all that and it was sort of built and just had some trouble getting it running running
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0181880_0182342	yeah i've got somewhere p t
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0154224_0154366	and
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0222119_0222777	but an extended list of the meeting so you know you have bible whatever it was called oh one
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0132988_0133108	well think they were in the trees
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0232000_0232366	it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0169892_0170033	but not can't adjust it yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0226273_0226386	but you do it a lot
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0106774_0107296	you the the only thing you can search is a nice object and the only time you get one of those if you're loved an operation
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0075818_0076625	because i usually work on my own company for for the day and then up date it without checking if if the one in the shed one has changed
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0215917_0216096	oh well
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0209137_0209471	yeah like fine specific meeting
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0068265_0068459	yeah yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0248060_0248216	oh okay
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0053397_0053633	one one object for each meeting
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0115580_0116003	like when it loads up the transfer window and the whatever other window
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0220271_0220456	but then yeah as i said how'd you do
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0236408_0237040	one thing the end ones are one and two and three and four and five and six
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0105794_0105945	and that's the one and two
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0242760_0242869	it might be useful one time
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0152722_0153001	oh yes key words give you an idea of what i'm trying to say
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0149296_0149507	just the list of three words or something
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0052052_0052355	and then if you call a normal contract
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0055391_0055574	yeah yeah i'll be pretty busy
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0134767_0134902	probably even right there
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0148571_0149086	so what would the these fake topics what what would they look like
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0206558_0207407	just because i want people to go through all the menus and search themselves and just do completely use this text or just exit and just let me use the program
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0235508_0235796	it's the night right course and then he got nine nine eleven
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0271853_0272207	well it wouldn't show up on the search results if it didn't exist too
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0274879_0275247	well the thing is i mean if it's well yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0048030_0048200	okay yeah that's fine
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0179192_0179324	so or umbrella
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0284934_0285207	you still wanna be able to search for the word language
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0064551_0064694	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0135328_0135540	yeah i love that
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0105945_0106173	but the slipper and next tuesday
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0134502_0135159	even one of them's even even better understanding or something
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0015536_0015731	well i'm not sure if it's his umbrella to be honest
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0272981_0273098	yeah i've told you before
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0046420_0047031	and and it would come up with how much they spoke and you can pick the one that looks most interesting
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0149212_0149416	that's probably the easiest thing
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0032375_0032689	it's just the strings noise etc etc etc
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0087588_0088289	so you don't needta just because if we do the entire service says that there's you know
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0144273_0145030	because the the the df is the documentation for the each word area no what is it
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0177957_0178333	or so do world card work for something like that
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0164813_0165282	it was the whole point was to you see this is your bone
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0243694_0243809	yeah i should have wanted to take it
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0110080_0110675	the end there's only one sentence to the sentence
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0230954_0231487	so you've got a drop down menu a sandwich sandwich
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0244628_0244888	three years earlier i don't know
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0163367_0163566	yeah i mean if you have time
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0081352_0082292	as for for an encephalitis on that
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0269321_0269500	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0180980_0181393	so they got whole chunk of it
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0276282_0276454	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0179683_0179870	yeah because
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0045889_0046420	so you could zip through these topics meeting sorry
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0168186_0168529	it's not a comparison but just two words together well
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0099725_0099959	alright
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0051116_0051305	it's quite a lot of meat
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0171222_0171385	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0190013_0190401	and they just wanna go there and see stuff then they can immediately go and brush that
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0287733_0287945	but
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0033745_0033849	oh well
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0225832_0226409	they got out the busy way and i'm trying to sentence
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0247755_0248019	and i've got a doctor's appointment at ten to two
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0169446_0169675	well essentially i don't know
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0033862_0034307	whatever you give me i can do it
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0128525_0129236	they're not even the meetings but the name of the meetings so you wanna search for the word language
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0158755_0158866	well do we want it
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0126392_0126975	so so just sort of
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0219359_0219525	and a lot of
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0014128_0014333	in texas there's a lot of
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0161982_0162591	don't think we had that in the the
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0037336_0037437	yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0170774_0171163	you could make it
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0116206_0116826	all of a sudden the time is probably more caused by loading the actual data
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0205884_0206558	well i'm just saying these are a lot of problems well kind of language problems too have that sort of thing first
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0215327_0215467	yeah that's that's yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0019186_0019778	because in the meantime the the the there's i'm correct two columns one than the other than the other
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0092582_0093326	so nice machine that goes you know
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0163561_0163750	because i'm only gonna do this if i've got time anyway
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0246996_0247596	oh well i don't know because it's the lab and trying to get some work done for the the lab stuff
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0082292_0082443	so you've got different different different languages
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0034378_0034788	just a matter of deciding whether we what would be easiest all way around
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0047239_0047777	so i just leave in lots of things that it's just returned one number at a time
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0028920_0029041	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0220721_0221165	went one one one and he got two one for meeting one to speak
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0002306_0002541	does it squiggle and i like that
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0170922_0171222	let's not make it more complicated
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0193086_0193671	and we could bring things down like that to that level of detail if we want
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0228471_0228698	and but then you did the sentence
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0234346_0234496	what is numbness she found
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0263744_0263885	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0204369_0204625	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0233013_0233294	you can do all of that without even going anywhere nearby
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0090860_0091294	you hafta kinda cool it in your clothes and then it you know
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0147533_0147825	yeah it probably probably
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0154203_0154315	but speech therapy
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0219733_0220248	because you know you wanna search for a sentence if you wanna look for it then that's fine
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0246177_0246362	just after e s p t
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0178333_0178889	so if you're looking for a wire wire wire
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0100154_0100590	yeah well we're debugging getting sick of it
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0101925_0102381	or switch board that comes up it's just a blank form like that with some
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0038191_0038361	yeah that's that's easy
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0175023_0175228	it's pretty crude anyway but it's just looking for
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0213348_0213571	so yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0224134_0224316	but then yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0166254_0166691	yeah but it would be useful if you
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0157973_0158359	well you can't do search without yeah if you just can't rent the house
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0074568_0074831	oh okay so not the actual one but a copy of it
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0191761_0191972	you
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0183097_0183243	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0102824_0103036	yeah but how
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0239916_0240031	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0224692_0224950	but i'm not trying that yet but i was gonna do that
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0076625_0076783	okay
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0164155_0164659	the the meetings but also how often that that word occurred in that meeting
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0262136_0262837	just because if it is like individual doing the words for a particular document it's not really getting them together
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0179709_0179940	but the idea is that gives you an opportunity to score
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0257501_0258117	so we didn't don't progress on the speech category
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0155341_0156222	but sposta even calculating the the the what's his face says to himself and be too much too long
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0283154_0283256	yes
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0276627_0277014	and oh so with something like sunny day
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0198070_0198284	could have a side restaurant or something
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0255215_0255501	oh you're just saying it to us
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0214615_0215164	just here and here is just go to wherever and a go back
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0169280_0169446	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0080297_0080874	just one fine what kind of objects there were for the other ones
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0043546_0044062	it says like get get tough time and you you takes a name
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0219563_0219865	okay you're just looking for one species
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0269767_0270631	oh you could just ignore the writing if it doesn't show up together
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0198689_0199005	oh it's fascinating
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0251148_0251339	well it wouldn't be a long meeting then
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0219105_0219240	dropped something like that
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0049850_0049965	oh okay i see
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0205023_0205757	you know i wasn't gonna put any you know any help in there anyway
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0237040_0237498	because you go back and the the what's his name and make
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0238633_0239098	it's it's an interesting yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0115106_0115222	you mean just you know
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0072240_0072566	so that's two lines of code
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0129671_0130137	and then you can decide well i wanna search on this and this meeting or only
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0111723_0111938	only they know what meeting it is
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0086820_0087170	well the way you're doing it i was gonna ask if the way you're doing it
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0146533_0146683	yeah it was a general school
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0094447_0094830	well you know just the pop up one was difficult you know
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0068459_0068569	the
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0178889_0179192	actually that's a problem for me too
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0207992_0208211	probably or search something
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0109368_0109743	it hasta be an observation and even if you can go and search the whole course from that
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0142205_0142825	so she's gonna look at you know more straight forward sort of thing that really just feels what we needed to do
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0256031_0256612	and i collect meeting some
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0238898_0239158	okay i know it
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0196265_0196481	do we wanna say percentages
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0217863_0218569	but the code i mean maybe if they know the codes and in other courses
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0204803_0204956	yeah if we're quite good it has yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0268462_0268812	and in that sense for single for single word yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0128626_0128741	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0150892_0151721	because that would be really handy then we can actually test it on the usage as opposed to just doing it and not using it
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0049571_0049713	and it's an object
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0215164_0215514	and then from there it takes you to wherever you wanna go
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0062005_0062172	alright okay
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0242119_0242579	do we want another meeting at the end of the week with firstnamep
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0079543_0080115	so well oh yeah that's that's well
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0195177_0195627	yeah but i'm just thinking like initially when they load up
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0192304_0192679	like i'm just thinking of different ways we can do that like different buttons on the top
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0163566_0163798	do that as well
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0122317_0123043	but the things i mean if we got that then it's gonna be really really really really
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0269326_0269623	for the most part we can just do something really simple
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0168529_0168814	and i don't know
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0250776_0250894	or if we could try one
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0067308_0067648	well let me know when when it's sort of useful
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0018262_0018397	yeah not not really
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0036935_0037078	pretty much i don't know
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0090239_0090431	umbrella umbrella
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0114868_0114978	and then they hafta go through the
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0093764_0093949	so i can feel that in now
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0143503_0144032	think you needta have that
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0091738_0092049	okay okay
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0124307_0124688	go to meeting one then hasta read read the normal object
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0075690_0075818	well just just tell me when
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0224883_0225023	mouse over is it or something
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0067637_0068265	but if you wanna make the picture you can do that without anything
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0237773_0237959	it's it's very cruel
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0256898_0257262	then we know who's missed him or if he've done any
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0055128_0055476	can you put it in there what type was broken about
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0100149_0100733	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0015854_0016228	you haven't hadta build any new windows to do that
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0151946_0152612	but we can't compare it to the handentitative you know the hand segmented tour
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0134649_0134767	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0045399_0045889	that you wanna see part two you wanna see which one is broken most something like that
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0165013_0165350	actually because the thing is i mean totally
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0267224_0267660	and then you've got those that just maintenance you know maintenance fairly like ones or two times a year saying
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0052811_0053116	is it for the entire course
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0252792_0252904	three and four and five and six
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0016668_0016786	oh well
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0119318_0119664	so it's gonna be loading up each other one at a time to get the date
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0091294_0091408	that's the same
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0240396_0240635	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0204219_0204433	oh yeah

AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0234609_0234815	just yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0239583_0240106	it's a invitation to an event
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0012507_0012860	oh i think there is
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0263546_0263744	oh i think it would
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0226386_0226994	you know to to search for a specific use of you hafta hold my mouth over that one
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0038361_0038476	so i'm trying to use it
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0241021_0241212	it's not quite fun
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0224316_0224556	oh no it's not at all
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0236191_0236358	yeah

AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0059579_0060210	they can load each all of the whole lot and do a search of the whole lot to find who participates in what no problem or what
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0148152_0148272	oh i see
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0105814_0106146	and through that when you got the results you click on something and that lies out with us
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0003721_0003846	okay
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0050663_0050813	thank you

AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0181663_0182241	so i can sort of trace back and figure out what objects they are and bring them up to here
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0058705_0058934	oh's like twenty five
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0130510_0130868	they needta use each other

AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0094723_0094995	yeah i think you gave it a final name and it tells it in knows
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0077673_0078155	yeah i just finish they might be some puddle
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0018749_0018957	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0086606_0086931	the only thing i could think of was an
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0027218_0027489	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0080798_0081025	it like for your stuff do you have
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0214288_0214589	oh okay okay
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0079280_0079699	well so it uses my part as well my d m s
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0040120_0040237	oh yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0193337_0193727	well just if there's three of the top meetings we said before
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0211992_0212200	and it didn't look like what a assignment really
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0089864_0090401	meanwhile it's time to say we can't really put more than one category really or one one sort of simple gift
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0097654_0098357	actually have you ever managed oh yeah you must've been playing some sort of music on the dance machines
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0205438_0205932	yeah yeah if i make a just
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0137988_0138094	if he finds the people
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0163258_0164252	because this i mean we have internet of seven pages and that's we can yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0112103_0112218	yeah exactly
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0111155_0111299	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0205767_0205902	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0208316_0209096	but we don't be doing a global search on the topic since they don't have labels
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0044253_0044625	oh i've done stuff like that before
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0100849_0100972	umbrella
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0112911_0113066	yeah it's true
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0044653_0045256	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0150594_0150724	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0043909_0044253	because i don't know
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0039715_0040133	but that took me so long to do this
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0012207_0012328	oh i see the puddle
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0214959_0215201	so i don't know really what we're gonna do
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0115201_0115311	oh i guess that's not
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0160131_0160714	did he say anything about what he expects of the final report and stuff
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0195571_0195821	and if we can yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0028244_0028456	as anyone had time to to play with it
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0148058_0148276	it's just funny that you know have it finished by monday
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0038566_0038773	it looked better on wednesday as well
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0143567_0143766	one two and he's gonna say
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0062279_0062926	and then in the meeting you could have the most commonly occurring one or you could have a little bit of each
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0040229_0040610	so i'm quite glad that it looks you know nice on one side and this kind of thing
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0093153_0093342	there's just basic little okay
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0131310_0131482	have more of a break
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0153143_0153293	oh okay i might have this stuff
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0138306_0139183	and the we have the the the presence on one half weeks or something whatever it is
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0209491_0209673	yeah all the little tunes yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0043889_0044535	yeah i tried that but yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0146247_0146629	we should aim to be finished by monday this monday coming
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0136947_0137425	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0125814_0126195	at the end we'll say you know you've given us any tests so
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0007291_0007454	yeah mine doesn't take too long
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0173882_0174181	and then if you i don't know double click on one
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0108360_0109058	but it's it's a job of course more than anything else
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0141775_0142184	it's not a good friday if it's that's
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0026667_0026774	okay
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0068205_0068504	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0142418_0142656	oh well it wasn't originally either
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0206489_0206636	well it it kinda makes sense
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0118486_0118681	oh i'm sure we could do that in meeting
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0140242_0140610	and i thought evaluation maybe for the report
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0182533_0182797	because the the training window does cross crossing
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0207760_0207915	we are still doing our top secret
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0031119_0031314	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0126228_0126447	but so he's sposta give us that secret
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0169404_0169517	well
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0210871_0211092	like if you're creating a
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0123383_0123515	but
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0089082_0089224	oh
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0025643_0025952	oh these kind of crazy huge things that were amazing
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0027476_0027982	it's it's much better than it was
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0027116_0027389	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0032835_0033593	but if it's a real area then it it stops so you can't do it anymore
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0025310_0025643	oh but they live there but there's i have even more stuff there
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0023032_0023273	yeah because i saw it again today was that me
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0209740_0209951	okay
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0174744_0175073	mean how to get that that communication between the two different kinds of windows
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0145965_0146120	it's a good yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0146629_0146885	well yeah well basically for today
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0023621_0024047	just don't remember that just
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0118504_0118703	and could actually be fun
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0083604_0084156	one one one one little question that i already know
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0035151_0035394	so didn't didn't take it for a full test drive yet
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0165915_0166112	so i don't think
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0086848_0086949	yeah i know yes
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0189484_0190231	because you only have one meeting open and those resources will be over i well i suppose if you have a local search
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0017470_0017772	yeah the funniest games
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0151464_0151692	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0063541_0063654	but you know i don't need that
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0055107_0056001	and then each meeting knows about all the different dog okay for each person in the meeting and they around that area
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0211507_0211992	and i didn't have a book trying to write the
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0150359_0150594	mean i'm not even worried about that
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0069674_0070291	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0151432_0151652	slipper
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0069241_0069415	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0097278_0097652	now
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0073526_0073733	so i just ignored that while
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0078493_0078683	see you start using that's whatever
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0151929_0152096	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0091278_0092182	that's it
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0048815_0049448	so the one statement is that it will i remember it because it was like everything is fixed by state
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0046770_0046985	but it's good you know
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0026083_0026667	it's alright
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0090402_0090808	but anybody having a artistic talent
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0210340_0210705	don't think we can expect you to all so come up with a sentence for it as well
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0019388_0019671	and make sure for the rest of the night
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0130067_0130510	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0129539_0129786	well they're your friends so they should
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0154502_0154676	well now you can
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0088236_0089082	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0110038_0110335	rubish
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0038021_0038352	now it's not the top priority
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0103034_0103425	we'll see what happens in the next few days
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0162181_0162365	it's gonna be a lot
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0082282_0082406	yeah yeah doesn't matter
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0066256_0066714	but the some of the interesting ones don't occur things like joke not okay very often
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0212200_0212531	it's it's it's a straight forward as writing and that type of thing
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0097451_0097610	can we get sound on these machines
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0006588_0006734	okay
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0057447_0057616	so i don't know what we want to describe
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0080298_0080635	yeah i was thinking that it sort of turned out that way but didn't it
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0050682_0050792	well i don't know what that means
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0104744_0105104	to be looking through the highest ranked ones first
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0040968_0041094	okay and that's
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0187847_0187994	highlights yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0091487_0091840	well i know some basic people
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0047380_0047894	the the the little girl's all done in acalifornia and everything
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0042029_0042437	haven't done it i haven't updated all those objects yet because it takes ages to complete
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0004900_0005215	oh
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0002063_0002511	forget every time
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0218498_0218791	they mean just get work done
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0183290_0183584	that was the pain
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0143624_0143738	oh okay
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0218791_0218984	but i think that's what i've gotta do
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0205710_0205844	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0207310_0207511	or that's sort of like our own team
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0069235_0069446	alright
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0144807_0144937	because if not then
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0194615_0195308	so the the resources from that will you know narrow down where we're gonna use for the local search
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0007053_0007312	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0153647_0153757	yeah thursday twenty four
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0169906_0170600	well i will need your snips of code or if we good if i had them by tomorrow evening
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0043448_0043867	well can you can you connect to your home machine and then start from there
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0034404_0034674	and the the the the the
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0174429_0174744	it's that's the other big part
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0190932_0191506	because you know if you get back several different meetings here and you've only gone one meeting over then you can't cross right there
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0210701_0210871	well no it would be kind of scary
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0188570_0188695	the trip or whatever it is
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0083101_0083343	so so
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0051370_0051605	and then the other side
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0201930_0202490	just just take that away the the little checkbook
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0085342_0085510	yeah we have something else
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0026982_0027116	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0044972_0045397	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0032314_0032693	that i think when you left click or right click or something i can't remember now
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0117920_0118139	come up with a name for that sort of thing
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0178574_0178779	is that how it works in the other ones
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0058348_0058783	just okay show all or show you know only the interesting ones
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0024183_0024302	so it doesn't really
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0021506_0022321	because i was trying some stuff couple weeks ago so that maybe mine
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0185645_0185769	you could take that for loading
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0154016_0154252	we're playing on having a big party on the twenty first
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0065511_0066137	but then we went a selection of three or four maybe interesting ones and then
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0164008_0164164	seventy pages yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0179185_0179812	usually one left clue it's high lights it cross
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0036835_0037111	but it doesn't matter too much
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0028945_0029123	now i was kid really
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0072533_0072653	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0036363_0036835	the only thing is it's not the start ups money's not too pretty

AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0110371_0110848	mean sometimes they have meetings that don't have any explanation to them
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0151652_0152009	oh no
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0017545_0017761	it's just i don't know it seems a little crazy
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0165717_0166013	yeah that could be yeah that could be five or six pages
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0206073_0206264	yeah i did think you but but ah oh
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0122211_0122354	well i'll try to do my best
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0098687_0098797	if

AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0096153_0096712	well they know it's a difficult experience i guess
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0088088_0088254	supersize meeting brothers
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0043872_0044186	oh
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0220281_0220403	three
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0141076_0141216	oh it's the last time
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0100972_0101247	okay well this it looks good
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0025952_0026083	read them they were for this time
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0118703_0118805	yes exactly
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0087458_0087887	whatever i see that before
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0106975_0107255	maybe i'll try
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0175946_0176441	that was why i was sort of deciding to get the three pairs in there instead of just the one
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0073946_0074059	and the speech and music
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0133975_0134636	the things did on the t i c o r a wheel and it's that's what they're those three three people
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0100450_0100612	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0142694_0142974	well it i'm sure on the website says that's there
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0217585_0217717	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0056001_0056677	and we'll give you that in top order as well or you can just search for the specific directory
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0148916_0149051	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0109005_0109126	oh
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0031013_0031119	five it's well yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0113883_0114458	so did we have a day for when we actually want the something done
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0059782_0060580	but it would be difficult if you know if in the speech category window we had a heading you know top five categories
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0076024_0076748	yeah i mean just keep it simple
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0040826_0040967	oh this is just yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0131482_0131772	so that may be an idea get a range of types of people as well
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0174233_0174429	it doesn't do anything yet
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0216482_0217203	see what steve says about the vehicle and then well keep in touch by email if you need it
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0162406_0162725	oh it's fifty percent of the mark i think is it
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0187994_0188550	oh yeah obviously high lights whatever you've clicked on here but also high lights
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0080103_0080384	just fix them with an umbrella and
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0118139_0118504	and that's that's fairly straight forward
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0132102_0132203	oh
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0166261_0166473	but it's gonna be probably
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0099842_0099951	from time to time it works yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0135096_0135215	oh
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0203017_0203143	yeah local anyway yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0050983_0051183	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0090954_0091434	you think we're doing amazing if we
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0004996_0005368	oh i so wonderful
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0148522_0148694	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0204919_0205171	so he's gonna be able to do a globe series of topics
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0109484_0109629	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0016966_0017340	getting a better feel for all these nice objects
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0041480_0041897	well the the speech category is finished
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0091917_0092258	we'll check if i can find anywhere
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0126933_0127272	yeah find some people that's how i understood it
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0150022_0150518	let's see
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0018272_0018612	then you spend the time to invest and learn all about them but it's okay well
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0191550_0191944	oh yeah this this will this is actually different from how we printed it here
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0193267_0193395	what do you mean by mobile
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0130060_0130210	yeah that's true
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0085510_0085735	just a little microgolf
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0038183_0038603	if if he changes your window manager it might look a little bit nicer
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0015416_0015672	so so those are able to play with
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0197295_0197410	if it's not it
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0002952_0003133	but umbrella
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0156649_0156753	we should have it done anyways
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0110304_0110440	it's my speech is well
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0008509_0008640	oh well
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0087488_0088107	it would be sue for that i think
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0039372_0039778	actually can we run it on windows
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0133554_0133668	five
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0135407_0135572	it's just you want me
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0084666_0084871	instead of the
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0142276_0142587	it's not a good friday
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0081562_0081701	now just kinda
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0140752_0140882	twenty fifth is
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0088280_0088700	and i don't know
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0155338_0155536	one and two funny right in him and he's angry
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0024880_0025008	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0075358_0075462	okay
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0069860_0070409	that's very good
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0192057_0192623	then we're gonna do it like how we said before and pop up a little bit of the very meetings that found those terms
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0124769_0124899	maybe just today
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0127272_0127400	the thing is you know
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0054120_0054797	well that's the thing i want you to know whether or not because at the moment you can get there's a method that will just give you the top five for all the top six
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0209132_0209233	okay
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0057819_0058348	or i know if we have a a choice so they can filter through those the the top most common
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0145491_0145868	and anyway she's trying to get the tight others
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0018894_0019151	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0137769_0137988	but yeah he finds them then that's cool
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0067300_0067832	oh
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0114977_0115151	okay
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0054020_0054141	three or four something
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0136194_0136389	yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0100254_0100450	yes
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0133368_0133554	oh i was thinking no ten
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0059149_0059684	mean you know i think you know it be difficult
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0021504_0021700	oh i heard it
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0103314_0103778	and we're gonna be trying to get the
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0120589_0120727	and that would give us the whole weekend
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0149456_0149558	oh the next one okay
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0190572_0190694	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0144673_0144807	we should definitely ask him
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0125261_0125430	all though we really want the answer
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0074059_0074781	and also the other thing that they have is if somebody coats something so if i coat a jacket to you they separate that
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0203575_0203798	everything else can just stay the same you know
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0207919_0208441	well we're certainly do it enough to make it so we can do it at the very least
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0012988_0013625	and i didn't have problems to get in to outpatient your phone
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0025312_0025661	and that's all

AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0176802_0177381	well this this is the ice cream by the way
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0149671_0149979	oh we have three
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0054797_0055107	you give it a number and it'll give you the total whatever for each person
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0110848_0111427	so right i'll try this then and see what it gives me
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0035525_0035715	it's well right after this yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0202278_0202422	umbrella
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0084638_0084829	by the way yes
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0202681_0202785	have for the start of it
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0126563_0126708	he said he would try
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0017761_0018272	oh i know it's it's like if you're gonna use the stuff later on in your life
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0165633_0165800	that's gonna be quite a few pages
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0036863_0037115	oh a lot of this java stuff isn't the
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0162302_0162513	mean while this
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0157128_0157274	oh well but yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0167850_0168296	and when i get home today which will be before
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0150813_0151225	and you must have your research proves you know
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0004201_0004336	and they're going to go to that
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0060580_0061211	but they're not at the top five but top four but top five the most common ones which you know
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0094287_0094388	they're just in the main frame
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0105104_0105252	so we are gonna look for him
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0132751_0132990	so how many people were you trying to because
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0209151_0209429	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0109808_0110031	how'd you guys find the documentation for the next time
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0139417_0139544	two oh jeez
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0219012_0219251	we can just email if you need it
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0147364_0147545	yes yeah and then get
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0103900_0104113	possible to open up more than one
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0075513_0075642	well it's not a real job anyway
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0195308_0195571	then we'll just do the local search on those ones and that's what we're looking for
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0130680_0130898	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0095345_0095469	yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0014324_0014843	yeah because i forget mine as well and it's just like you know every time put something in there
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0078503_0078649	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0081261_0081362	but i can change it
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0059504_0059733	well if we just absolutely fill them out
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0019753_0020065	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0025008_0025238	turns
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0031056_0031237	so it's just kinda doesn't really do anything
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0030007_0030205	but they didn't cause any problems but it just
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0163144_0163258	yeah oh yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0069679_0069860	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0112756_0112904	and without having to look at the soil
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0052391_0052733	slipper
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0027676_0027902	yeah exactly
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0119597_0120310	but we don't be able to do any evaluation anymore so i think we could set monday
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0063146_0063342	but it's not take a lot of space if you have it
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0108083_0108360	they didn't expect this course to be so much trouble
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0209642_0209821	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0015672_0016188	trying to get the tops and summertime and well
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0152163_0152341	so
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0188848_0188969	well she's difficult because
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0202490_0202650	because
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0082941_0083101	it looks in the same direction it works
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0120899_0121052	yeah it's gone
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0157793_0158247	and we needta know that anyway to prepare the presentation of the first place
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0200307_0200435	it's too bad
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0200435_0200738	just realize i haven't done that part yet
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0148594_0149073	it's like if we had you know a bit more time
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0015002_0015254	that was the main thing so as soon as that's done it'll be ready
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0074781_0075165	so they put the the the dog a collar and then they put that side
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0123133_0123383	well probably hafta talk to firstnames at some point or something
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0185971_0186525	so if we have that the same on this one at least that you if you double level then it goes
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0132565_0132750	it's a white room of people
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0052411_0052523	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0212531_0212781	so it's but it's ordinary seeing the second one
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0076880_0077078	hmhm
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0099902_0100259	yes i guess that's why we have a separate speech lab
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0096156_0096516	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0095198_0095345	yeah yeah just fix it in the corner
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0127010_0127175	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0156342_0156473	that yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0137207_0137686	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0081863_0082071	we could put it in a package
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0209408_0209642	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0136592_0136905	and one i don't know
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0034674_0034783	yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0118805_0119034	it's just brainstorm yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0027357_0027476	yes i don't remember
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0095016_0095251	oh so it'll do the automatix crashing down
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0052538_0052702	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0072044_0072846	what depends on the dog's that he makes in the meeting and hopefully so one's favorite
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0082410_0082679	it doesn't seem to make any difference i never even use drugs or pictures
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0104113_0104744	as many nonobjects as we were gonna figure that the writing did make sense
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0039518_0039783	what is that
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0176699_0177347	yeah so so there's a couple of those little things that are yeah okay
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0100744_0100849	oh yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0132950_0133165	three i don't think like three or four maybe
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0125430_0125786	so so if we don't ask we push it off
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0134790_0135144	then you can do a massive amount of animals on three people
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0195663_0195780	oh i see what you mean yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0038603_0038718	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0121052_0121445	yeah i've got my d n a presentation on monday
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0135848_0136057	one one ounce

AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0149119_0149585	well i'm not sure after the eighteen
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0203393_0203597	it's that's quite straight forward
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0164252_0164518	we could probably just expand that
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0189392_0189561	even if we could just
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0059098_0059276	umbrella umbrella
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0209233_0209491	little all the little ones
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0063991_0064404	so you got the globe one there and then here you can just have the top five in this meeting yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0112554_0112756	it's it's good to know what methods are there so
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0076813_0076935	the the
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0022410_0023001	it doesn't have anything in it at all
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0101446_0102253	around running some trouble with the engine but found a other package and instead of writing it from scratch
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0100305_0100661	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0129630_0130067	they're gonna need us for presentation and everything like that
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0011917_0012147	oh well

AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0116565_0116699	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0114458_0115163	but i though we yeah i thought we changed it to the tenth or something
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0147092_0147205	umbrella umbrella
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0024270_0024714	give you all the possibilities of what's happened and something's going on
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0118798_0118957	and make it up together
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0210877_0210998	well yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0214589_0214771	but
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0052876_0053288	an engagement is a big one that comes up all the time yes no questions
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0124630_0124769	and the
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0079699_0080103	actually do we have naming conversion for our our
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0109501_0109808	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0190231_0190333	then it could cross over
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0094007_0094383	yeah yeah i know yeah how to put it there
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0202772_0202979	yeah because in the story you can't have them
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0052095_0052411	actually yeah you can see that they don't do that and it's the bottom of their list
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0152986_0153581	and just that's why i'm trying to find his his dates
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0057267_0057447	but i could change that
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0142163_0142403	useta do this a lot you know
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0129220_0129630	well they they're gonna you need us

AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0129674_0129833	yeah i know but
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0052524_0052865	it's just very quiet
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0109184_0109734	in fact it's an ex tpa
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0066714_0067023	well they do sometimes but they're not that common
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0051559_0051733	well it's kinda boring yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0120308_0120594	yeah the one and more recent
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0133528_0133914	oh it would take forever and then he got annoyed at the results
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0143446_0143624	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0206507_0207067	well it's not first probably maybe but i don't know
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0033537_0033821	but i did have a
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0020970_0021307	excuse me
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0015254_0015416	oh i was making a couple little changes as well
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0114513_0115039	we changed it to write it
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0109126_0109300	perfect job
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0089751_0089873	yeah and everything you know
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0038773_0039024	because charity uses the native windows doesn't it
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0107864_0108008	that's it
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0087619_0087884	alright
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0197254_0197407	yes yes
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0127630_0127793	yeah right yeah

AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0082679_0082941	doesn't even make sense to me
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0155756_0155884	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0195821_0196372	so it will be a bit different from from how that is right now when we do the club search at least
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0092623_0092786	otherwise i'll make up some
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0169604_0169952	so i'm trying to remember to do that to mine
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0133263_0133368	menu
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0098936_0099810	if the sun code is registered to your name which it usually is not and you hafta rehab and sometimes it's still doesn't work yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0150257_0150782	because because i don't have anything after the eighteen apart from this
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0139544_0139677	two two two two years today

AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0059359_0059504	yeah i don't know yeah it doesn't really mean
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0199631_0199794	it's just what
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0132330_0132565	think that may be good as well
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0018957_0019079	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0209246_0209408	exactly
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0120773_0120899	to work on it as well
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0139766_0140033	do we hafta have done the evaluation by then
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0126439_0126709	well sort of that's how i understand it
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0030441_0031056	it just depends everything out in the shell as well because it does it's definite behavior anyway
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0041310_0041492	that's nice
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0023775_0024183	it just happens
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0130370_0130504	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0209821_0209934	now we're doing that

AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0026882_0026983	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0081701_0081885	and think about future stuff maybe
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0075165_0075639	just enrolled any any course or something to do with i just grabbed it
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0141791_0141925	is that good friday already
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0045916_0046646	so that it tells you what speech or in which meeting and then you can see which
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0016188_0016478	so that's that's sort of tonight as well
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0017772_0017917	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0016478_0016680	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0125070_0125180	they probably read it anyway
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0019703_0020121	two piece of bread
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0049448_0050088	so everybody's top of the ladder and so everybody's top of the ladder
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0184682_0185363	and and that works when you left double click on the meeting sorry then it loads
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0179927_0180420	if you have a particular window that you want me to fix it
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0056677_0057267	but you hafta search on in books and cases and real words out of my mind
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0091434_0092082	slipper
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0097092_0097278	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0019391_0019703	you can choose a picture
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0182347_0182533	it's difficult
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0155209_0155380	so twenty four so we
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0068407_0068548	and so you know who's doing the work
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0142656_0143082	yeah okay
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0035556_0035682	yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0137628_0137769	oh god
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0148276_0148594	because after monday i'm pretty much free for about a week or so
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0029599_0030007	it generate a lot of questions in the background
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0144537_0144643	but we should ask him
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0202422_0202634	it's actually fairly
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0025012_0025312	yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0203227_0203393	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0011420_0012024	was that answer
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0047894_0048815	but the some of the the thing at she why one wanted to take about the
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0034811_0035151	oh i was more less just playing with the things that had to do during what i was doing
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0096698_0096891	oh yes
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0105967_0106108	he's interested no
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0192899_0193337	choose the one we wanna actually do this or think mostly would make the most sense
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0158872_0159599	basically how is it going with your evaluation
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0020309_0020675	there's a fire in the directory
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0064997_0065404	yeah just do top five but a little and globe and then have another
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0046985_0047241	it's got a good interface is use
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0171732_0172201	just basic pretty much the internet still
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0027076_0027357	yeah so that's what it's about yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0031602_0032314	there's still one air which is bug in in ex tc that always generates these
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0031314_0031602	the thing is that yeah there's as i said a while ago
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0191944_0192057	like if we're doing a college course
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0198555_0199395	it should be fairly simple to just get the topics and the stories using that text structure thing you wrote
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0173159_0173266	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0193727_0194086	the language we're looking for the word language and get the highest rated ones
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0127211_0128210	because we're gonna get an email on our ass
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0026400_0026858	oh it's huge several
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0107140_0107443	if you can make it right then i'll be wellchuffed
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0006734_0007677	keep in mind i'm dropping this because as i said it doesn't seem very good
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0024953_0025451	umbrella umbrella
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0068535_0068751	yes see that's what speech therapy
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0063654_0063991	because it's because it's the secret of the window the breaks the window
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0092316_0092511	well if you find anything then send it to me
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0123949_0124267	we could send him an email but i don't know if he's around even
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0205569_0205767	is that what you mean yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0129224_0129346	it's hard finding people
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0162887_0162990	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0209934_0210340	well yeah even if i haven't to mention to make it due some kind of key words
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0036931_0037073	yeah i know
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0085748_0086228	oh no i went to something original
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0053288_0053572	what else comes up
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0157584_0157793	yeah yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0137425_0137628	they go for
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0211183_0211507	yeah if i'm gonna do that
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0104085_0104232	yeah well i think about that
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0143656_0144109	well you know the the question is do we need the evaluation for the presentation
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0160714_0160855	legs or
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0087460_0088218	it's
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0052523_0052876	and
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0068919_0069261	so i'm all interested in this guy because he seems to be funny
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0068152_0068407	exactly what you wanna do and look at these things
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0084458_0084804	well no the thing is in the top left
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0102253_0102750	because i don't know just now but i haven't played around with that much
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0121866_0122045	well but yeah monday
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0217410_0217555	yes we'll see you in thursday
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0152281_0152785	in our timeline we were in twenty fifth and that's the friday i think
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0061270_0061732	we should have the global top five that because each speech has got a top top whatever
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0016680_0016966	but and that it's sort of come along
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0218169_0218366	do you need another meeting this week
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0116932_0117417	well that's the problem because steve hasn't given us any details
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0187581_0187863	so one left click just high lights that's right
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0105485_0105663	hmhm
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0082770_0082939	yeah okay
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0150724_0150827	okay
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0105252_0105882	just pick the top five to do the the search and since that's probably what we're looking for anyway
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0075639_0075772	yeah yeah somebody else's
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0121596_0121866	stomping now
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0107820_0108083	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0144144_0144408	and i didn't think so especially
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0098758_0098971	they have them on the front two i think
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0154557_0154768	and of course
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0131772_0132330	like not you know liquid liquid or yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0069749_0070202	that was nice
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0147696_0147872	went to write the report and everything
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0114442_0114592	today wasn't it
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0212781_0213044	it would just look so complicated to get it from
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0033553_0033856	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0157162_0157354	but it's important to know
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0136859_0137042	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0090892_0090996	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0078649_0079199	and when i open the window i'll just recall the ends and then just get that
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0133153_0133265	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0093450_0094076	you do it in one of the whatever the main window is
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0113268_0113370	yes that's it
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0200781_0201493	is it very difficult to make another a other guy but only for a global surgery
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0073347_0073526	one a lot of my kind of was weird with me
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0063316_0063513	oh no i wouldn't yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0081369_0081562	oh no it doesn't matter at this point
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0094383_0094598	but i'm wet
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0053528_0054020	so which you know maybe you can suggest a few which which would be interesting to listen
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0125696_0125814	exactly
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0151069_0151276	well that's in the eighteenth
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0024562_0025175	oh i had lots of stuff in there yesterday
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0043111_0043280	yes all the time
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0130898_0131310	actually some other friends in my different groups might be more willing
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0148668_0148771	that's the point
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0023456_0023857	but jelly yeah that was sure
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0169143_0169262	yeah no no big rush
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0023273_0023456	yeah i think so
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0084804_0085504	at the moment they've gone ex
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0119308_0119597	the thing is yeah we had the the the dead last friday
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0121445_0121759	after read the paper
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0011518_0011696	now that's just very
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0077116_0077494	okay so that's sort of unpleasant now or is that awful
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0139470_0139766	oh it's two weeks then
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0155884_0156315	just to ask whether we needta the evaluation done for the department
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0024302_0024419	just fun in there
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0050087_0050345	well we're included that then
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0019590_0019753	yeah right
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0155026_0155150	so
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0141247_0141500	oh i thought he said twenty five
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0183744_0184682	and when you right click on a topic it pops open the list of meetings that continue that topic
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0141940_0142114	yeah yeah it's good friday
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0149558_0149960	yeah yeah i'm free this after this monday and it's well whatever
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0095446_0096325	we hafta remember to include that in our evaluation how did the give improve improve your brushing experience
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0202155_0202278	rain
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0216053_0216169	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0073056_0073347	oh i think most things are good
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0146055_0146174	yeah you might be right
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0126030_0126220	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0160938_0161185	just made some comments at the last meeting
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0136076_0136194	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0017326_0017470	oh
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0089258_0089791	just probably basic just text font just something nice
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0021106_0021208	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0172507_0172809	but at the beginning when you haven't searched yet
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0172201_0172565	just sort of goofy type thing and just
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0099304_0099420	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0072390_0072533	geeks me
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0028508_0028614	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0042437_0042884	so i do it it fast for some reason if i log in at home and then run the code
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0091249_0091487	well it's probably some people are barking
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0160781_0160938	there a few little things
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0018612_0018924	what's the minimum i can get away with that that we'll get me what we need
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0155606_0155728	oh it's actually twenty four
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0129036_0129224	yeah if they have time
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0194086_0194615	actually look for the terms we're not loading it up of all seventy five or so
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0037073_0037439	at the moment as well the whole window that pop up not pretty tall
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0141278_0141396	so it's not the yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0028023_0028142	oh no
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0178779_0179183	and the other window the very like if you're in the top
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0201665_0201959	so that we search two different
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0136905_0137789	oh
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0138094_0138215	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0149960_0150359	oh well that's that's easy compared to the other stuff
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0013593_0013694	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0151225_0151432	is that on the
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0004128_0004707	oh it's stuck yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0088279_0088765	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0038026_0038251	so i will if
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0096862_0097042	could even have some sound when it comes on
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0162869_0163120	mean i think we should write everything
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0075840_0076024	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0164660_0164909	mean a lot of it's gonna be the same thing
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0088262_0088398	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0020117_0020297	and anyway so yeah that's about that
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0026983_0027218	should run the umbrella
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0136275_0136593	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0137042_0137183	and there we should just have two
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0146885_0147214	stunt the vehicle pretty much straight way and then get
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0035394_0035525	but i can do that
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0115163_0115809	because the thing's i mean we can keep working on little things you know and just so
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0010815_0011006	he wants to ride the umbrella
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0169501_0169604	all of a sudden get out of the way
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0125543_0125696	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0050314_0050682	and then everybody the next one seems to most be backcountry
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0092806_0093153	how do you add that to the journal program
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0140610_0140752	so and that's on the twenty fifth
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0137100_0137490	one one one woman and there
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0013694_0013806	yeah forgot that last
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0069493_0069749	it's taken them to the next stage
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0165229_0165633	and then i mean write about the evolution and stuff
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0133872_0133975	yes exactly
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0130210_0130370	yeah that's true
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0057616_0057967	that's what i'm asking you right
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0018924_0019419	so it's on less i wanna do something with this in the future
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0012024_0012207	but okay
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0062130_0062233	for the speech
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0172809_0173357	is it still divided into two and the bottom half is just just empty
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0141075_0141211	you know the first day i think
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0122354_0122457	and i mean we could
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0152773_0153143	maybe that's us then not him
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0093222_0093399	oh i'm not sure
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0069233_0069679	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0107377_0107864	yeah yeah that be surprise because i'm bad at golf
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0007677_0008425	but maybe if i said it here on the this branch
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0161997_0162216	except somewhere ten to fifteen pages
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0067354_0067828	he followed all this up
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0161535_0161657	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0136389_0136592	they were sposta be women
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0139359_0139538	yeah it's tuesday and wednesday

AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0141952_0142066	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0096155_0096418	yes
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0175461_0175946	because the things are if we have different things in here like triangles versus squares versus triangles
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0123581_0123733	just
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0028614_0028945	hadta play with it yesterday
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0086016_0086731	oh
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0199655_0200097	and just do you hafta get the tops out and stuff yeah you hafta get the tops out and everything
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0098317_0098701	but no but i think if you put it together you'll just play just normally
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0177347_0177529	yeah and makes more sense
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0131849_0132005	maybe yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0140970_0141080	that's what i understood
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0071373_0072234	twenty is that the what percentage of his speech is
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0033280_0033537	yeah i didn't follow any of the
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0097105_0097311	umbrella
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0080941_0081261	you know i'm just but it's cool meeting and speech
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0145149_0145491	well we should try have it done by then anyway i think
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0181008_0181185	well it's difficult because
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0161185_0161535	just general like how it all came together
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0206625_0206726	yeah that's it
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0109058_0109200	it's just
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0149560_0149671	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0106821_0106975	seriously
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0067735_0067906	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0025175_0025310	oh it's done
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0090808_0090936	umbrella
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0051521_0051791	four i don't know if that's very useful because everyone does it
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0051947_0052095	there are some people who don't do that
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0030281_0030441	are we keeping that how that happens
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0167052_0167284	so you wanna write in an email then
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0158247_0158353	and
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0025880_0026232	oh wait a minute
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0116104_0116933	so do we want to set an actual hard deadline for when exactly we're gonna start the evaluation
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0203231_0203342	yeah would you make that
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0171289_0171434	at the moment you're searching window
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0147522_0147750	because we needta write a presentation as well
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0099271_0099427	oh
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0003133_0003297	what's the word
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0207915_0208053	oh you're you're awesome
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0204669_0204942	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0037439_0038026	but you know i would make them a bit nice if i had more time but at the moment it doesn't look like that
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0093342_0093493	it's really easy you know
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0204584_0204934	rain umbrella
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0026774_0026982	so we probably won't hafta worry about that
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0177559_0178451	yeah maybe you wanna leave one left click high the the resolve and what ever you've got open
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0192623_0192899	and then we're you know
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0092082_0092228	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0078195_0078339	but think it's pretty much complete now
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0127793_0127917	or looking for volunteers
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0106575_0107074	still can't make it run tea
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0203798_0204134	and five you can just leave everything as it is and just remove the checkbook
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0123676_0123949	well probably just a regular Tuesday meeting with him
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0087192_0087460	they have the big yellow and maybe
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0024032_0024162	oh this is scary
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0068442_0068558	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0168622_0169192	before half past six i will make that file readable write everything
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0075772_0076025	so yeah yeah to be honest about your experience
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0182924_0183290	in a very odd way because he hasta find the topic first
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0023001_0023214	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0161530_0161870	did you ever say how long it was sposta be
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0180825_0181051	so it's like the topic window or whatever
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0026377_0026667	what exactly do you know how much we have
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0173517_0173764	and as these come up it'll just pop them in there
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0094912_0095078	yeah yeah perfect
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0002312_0002562	oh yes it doesn't stick at all
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0085720_0085881	yeah right
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0163174_0163343	oh we have a bit of time to do the writing
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0216169_0216280	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0209060_0209246	knife knife
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0120918_0121032	but
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0064404_0064962	and then the top five in that meeting and then the rest is obvious in it
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0206901_0207310	see are we bothering with our tops off still
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0040589_0040879	you using a gooey butter or just all from cold
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0128207_0129005	if we don't get anything from him then we should just do our friends basically
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0100254_0100425	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0019495_0019601	seems only
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0042884_0043116	it runs it much faster than if i do it here
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0012734_0013051	have you changed the the flood yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0022869_0023008	yeah that's right yeah

AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0008872_0009062	oh
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0206264_0206444	and i think we're gonna be alright
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0076025_0076404	he he
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0035682_0036229	is there any any company you have about just like wedding and or some sort of money things
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0100612_0100744	he's a lot of audio
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0135493_0135700	how can you get a range of people if you have three
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0133914_0134088	don't know i don't know
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0154289_0154502	oh
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0086228_0086606	what do you guess
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0110161_0110304	okay good
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0080690_0080798	yeah well that's sort of what i was doing
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0133165_0133775	that's that's a lot
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0131225_0131608	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0202569_0202681	oh
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0199496_0199655	you've stuck
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0120594_0120764	because the eye is funny
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0044535_0044929	really weird
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0021208_0021506	and i saw that and i'm just trying to remember if i did create it
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0033434_0033643	it's a good thing
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0018698_0018894	yeah yeah exactly yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0114594_0114697	oh so it was funny
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0143247_0143567	so it gives us two days to do the evaluation
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0112218_0112577	well it's still i guess research plateform
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0017326_0017558	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0147902_0148058	it's fun you know
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0013999_0014535	when you said at the beginning i thought check the read write and then i never did
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0101720_0101945	you know but that was my main point we do you hafta use medicine
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0080057_0080603	maybe have an area of disability or something like that like a umbrella and with maneuvers
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0024789_0025060	and not gonna ask you to guess i'm gonna tell you that it was be a tiger
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0088518_0089370	yeah i don't know how for twenty five or twelve years ago
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0067829_0068347	mean i've got three videos
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0104776_0104904	thank you yeah
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0072768_0073605	don't think i could go any further with it than that so because it's got to be something useful by someone as well
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0059098_0059592	so i think i'd be able to put it up or i could put it in the shade or something
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0052492_0052624	oh
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0058638_0058798	okay that's excellent
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0083927_0084464	that's gonna be a problem anyway with the older generation and that's another issue you know how we tackle that
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0095602_0095807	yes no that's important
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0077073_0077283	things like that inside
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0103865_0104156	okay so let's break it up there
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0031914_0032186	okay i see it's one thing it's very supportive
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0050176_0050322	ugly right okay
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0093518_0094012	the other thing is just talking to mom phone phone friends again
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0077978_0078326	of course that just raises a point i wonder what our design people think
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0058512_0058638	seven
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0048126_0048468	yeah it doesn't look like what i want it to be
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0025989_0026225	and independent
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0011762_0012154	now we're developing our remote control
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0045400_0045694	oh well that's close enough okay
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0060321_0060809	yeah we hadta buy one
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0081365_0081509	what about granny and granddaughters
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0078326_0078704	but you know in a mobile phone you can press a key and it gives you a menu
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0065341_0065540	big hard game
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0057676_0057871	one point four something like that
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0089871_0090564	is it possible that that for the old generation you could have an extra button that you press for a large print books
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0102232_0102399	but i would probably
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0082812_0083151	don't think they tape things i don't think they use
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0004975_0005318	firstnameja this is gonna fall off
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0081235_0081365	well about the older generation
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0061913_0062426	half of the selling prices taken up by building it
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0027231_0027542	now he'd like to go next
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0082379_0082797	can he program his remote control or is he busy with that too
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0058837_0058954	should we be making notes
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0032413_0032773	it's your best friend in the world you can talk to a dog it can be best friend
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0061754_0061959	okay pretty huge man
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0066222_0066970	making that key point just that it's going to be an international market like that
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0101370_0101720	but yeah and it doesn't hafta be that
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0054715_0054953	but that interrupted
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0029068_0029332	thank you
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0008048_0008190	okay
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0049778_0049996	that's my dear that's the worst yes
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0045797_0046057	oops oh dear what happened there
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0081615_0082363	my grandson can answer his mom's phone call but he couldn't even dream of texting or something like that
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0057511_0057766	so yeah
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0098549_0098880	yeah
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0029332_0029602	maybe you can get what i'm trying to make
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0085279_0086194	minutes on phone phones now they're too old these pictures and stuff which make it fairly obvious what you're trying to do
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0095091_0095738	it might see a little bit of sposta looking bouncy it might look small
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0009196_0009474	okay this is our journey
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0086430_0087174	you know i i don't like the you know the new phones that kind of go a window's size running system
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0044523_0044668	hmhm
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0058385_0058512	one fifty
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0080380_0080592	with minutes yeah yeah
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0044795_0045085	oops this is no coming up part let me just put the top in
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0002515_0002683	you've got both of these clipped on
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0097068_0097179	oh well
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0070861_0071104	okay you want me to edit everything into one
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0104642_0104829	do we go back to our room
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0057871_0058150	one point four you know would make a pound or something like that
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0035911_0036174	oh alright
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0090564_0091178	obviously it depends less on the scene but as long as they can read it that's the main thing
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0049740_0049998	okay some of the bread
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0098880_0099666	just just quick thing about the what you're saying about the it doesn't need to be fashionable
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0032773_0033136	it doesn't decompose between you andbesides what you are
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0036433_0036784	does it look like a dog
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0104313_0104416	so see and half an hour
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0094848_0095316	that's a cost thing i don't know how much we're gonna know about it
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0102689_0103258	and they're kind of mowed and look a bit different and the telly west road construction or something
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0031569_0031739	he's sitting
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0028757_0028966	take the umbrella
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0018883_0019207	okay i leave speech for everyone else
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0036174_0036765	well since you guys have chosen the one i wanted to do i hafta go singing of it around
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0071292_0071717	my experience has only been been given the remote control with the objective i buy
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0028908_0029068	oh yeah
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0002237_0002381	am i sposta be standing up there
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0010193_0010814	then we go do two training
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0090577_0090750	totally yes it's gone that way
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0102210_0102441	yeah yeah yeah
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0046109_0046216	technically help
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0079446_0080057	alright i was thinking on the same lines you you know and sort of having too many buttons and make it complicated for the user
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0054142_0054715	and birds chirping
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0048877_0049141	it's not a umbrella honestly
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0075081_0075529	and symbols that you don't necessarily understand symbols you're meant to understand that you don't
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0085098_0085279	why everything's doing because i mean
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0094353_0094756	you have a bigger screen in the the flipper
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0102504_0102689	mean the sky reminds him everything
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0072244_0072768	but basically on off volume up and down channel one two that basic functions
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0068347_0069167	it's a tv and a certain amount of things all set up so we got one of the university remote controls
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0073498_0073730	yeah the main stuff anyway
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0014958_0015940	what needs to be filled by the product what effect the product has to have and how it's actually going to do that
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0084373_0084958	yeah why it just needs to be as long as it's so self inclusive and you can work out
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0009568_0010193	we will do some stuff get to know each other better to feel more comfortable with each other
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0060809_0061392	so i suppose later it depends if we want to or or is it going to make our project look a little better
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0037384_0037686	well as you can see the quality of the work today is
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0070270_0070483	but that was quite good the fact that you could
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0075486_0075592	oh
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0028514_0028661	what is this come from
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0095678_0095860	yeah because of the umbrella

AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0065357_0066222	so yes yes i don't think it's a case of working about different languages and things like that
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0082252_0082379	oh
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0002986_0003229	yeah good

AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0060813_0060929	and i think
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0056546_0057464	finance wise we've got a selling price of twenty five years which i don't actually know what that is in pounds
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0001099_0001453	we were not liked in life so maybe we can see that better

AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0010814_0011589	to stress our own ideas and everything and we've gone twenty five minutes to do that as far as i can understand
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0062426_0062944	and proof of age is fifty million years which is
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0012154_0012699	we want it to be original something that's unique people haven't thought of
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0003130_0003339	five right both of them okay
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0035348_0035555	yeah okay

AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0061351_0061782	yeah production costs at twelve fifty so
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0069167_0069939	that you program each of your things into but that kept losing the sentences so we hafta repair it every now and again
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0052413_0052596	he go
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0064823_0065111	and it's everyone use a friendly to everyone
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0008382_0009196	oh i'm sorry the project manager and this is our first meeting surprising you know
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0024322_0024433	or running at play
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0050119_0050466	five six right not a girl
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0015940_0016094	conceptualize
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0070596_0070891	you didn't have six remote controls in front of you
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0017038_0017203	okay right
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0084120_0084324	yeah the age group
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0042812_0043022	scary
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0069939_0070270	it was quite cheep as well so that may have been something to do with that
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0051987_0052095	they get it go
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0071124_0071332	yeah because
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0100524_0101484	so i think the whole design thing may be quite i mean you can still have plastic and it look quite good but
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0098120_0098951	probably about it and then we'll come back and lay's again and i get to do another fantastic party
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0052430_0052863	yeah yeah an easy
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0081521_0081896	you mean to say with less number
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0052691_0052920	oh right okay i'm not good at golf
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0071717_0072244	not doing any talking with in progress using it to program tv or video or things
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0043985_0044177	okay let's see
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0044014_0044212	okay
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0037680_0037894	it's amazing good
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0063129_0063642	yes yeah i presume so
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0059419_0060321	having said that they if you wanna get one of those the the ones on the moment list there about twenty pounds anyway
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0002912_0003048	but she's gonna answer me or not
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0045045_0045174	oh
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0035001_0035109	okay thank you
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0095969_0096635	and there's no reason we needta make it look as simple as a whole bunch of stuff you know
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0064913_0065029	yeah
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0044316_0044795	and i'm i'm very impressed with your artistic skills mine's are great
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0101945_0102210	so i don't know if using plastic doesn't make it cheaper
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0049290_0049778	and somewhere there's a body behind
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0077283_0077979	because it doesn't make it really complicated to look at it it's obvious what you're doing
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0047671_0047779	oh
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0008050_0008166	two two
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0092964_0093488	obviously simple and that's where you call recording and things like that
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0099666_0100524	so i had a quick look at the company website and it's like the the we put the fashion into a legume
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0055366_0055677	oh that pen's gonna be okay
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0051612_0051866	don't
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0095738_0095924	but it may have it's costs
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0087683_0088287	and i i've not gone a new one but my friend's gone a new one and that's trying to do things with it and i just kept getting lost
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0067520_0067829	what are you experiences with remote controls
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0103258_0103865	which looks a bit smart so yeah i guess that's enough to think about
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0083464_0083927	so that's the problem of any reason you you come up with
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0012699_0013201	it's not out in the shops trendy appearing to white market
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0031347_0031914	it's usually sitting so it's sitting it's not standing
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0058085_0058757	yeah yeah about seventeen seventeen points
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0080603_0081203	and if it's somewhat similar to what you have on a bicycle maybe
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0086443_0086588	but i don't know how
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0058954_0059174	you can just figure to the
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0082135_0082252	yeah thank you
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0025453_0025724	and i see them as majestic
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0039041_0039795	yeah i can be a crocodile
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0070518_0070672	you saw the ones
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0051149_0051612	sposta be so independent i put that one down again
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0039631_0039980	it's gonna be alright
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0008190_0008382	hello everybody
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0049996_0050809	that's it's meant to be a flying animal could have been a seagull
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0096635_0096916	and something that easily moved and proceeded
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0087295_0087683	five i find it really confusing i kept getting lost in the forest
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0100916_0101130	oh yeah
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0042120_0042597	yeah and i hafta think on the spot of things that it is
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0052920_0053660	see they're quite free spirit flying around everywhere doing their own thing
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0016231_0016780	what we're thinking how it's gonna go and then the details decide how we're gonna put it in practice and make it work
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0094012_0094353	you could have a slipper so that when you flip over the top
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0050809_0051149	and oh again i'm thinking on my feet good
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0096916_0097245	so i'm trying on your therapy
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0097097_0097935	okay we got half an hour before the next meeting so we're gonna go off and do our individual things
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0000037_0000176	oh
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0039795_0040627	well it was in first at first it was an attempt at a tea room and then it's sort of changed into a pub
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0027731_0027975	cat
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0037960_0038448	okay now i'm gonna have to change what it was originally because that looks like a bike now
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0075518_0075806	slipper a slipper of slippers you could think of
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0091369_0091737	or what about kind of a funeral
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0217196_0218132	it's only a few tv and a couple of popcorn should be in the remote control something like that about video pl
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0123492_0123679	hmhm
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0193952_0194291	yes which is cheping along run as well
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0065404_0066192	well other than having a lot of complex problems because you can have a normal routine which has the main features
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0182540_0182649	the problem yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0061620_0062515	actually some of my points might overove but what ever brain storming we did in the last meeting
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0083436_0083550	yeah i think you can pull it out now
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0086670_0087219	one and two and three and four and five and six old age groups from the lab
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0012023_0012947	our buddy would hafta affect try not to reflect our buddy that we might
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0088814_0089076	so as obvious disease infections there
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0148224_0148581	you don't think just moving your finger around in a small scope and going to do with that enough
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0124766_0125253	so we want
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0129154_0129967	it's the usage of it may and that the the sort of you know fascinating aspect of it we might hafta change for different markets around the world
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0143060_0143427	the engineering maybe our toughest project could be a better option for that
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0008127_0008353	okay
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0216498_0216776	write i think we hafta write up
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0221657_0222602	yes it could be a advertisement feature rather than a discount feature you know drawing attention to that
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0053624_0053899	it okay that's okay with me
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0066741_0067462	but to make it unique so that people wanna buy it will punch in this two features together
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0060255_0060416	oh i'm not sure
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0215628_0216163	six designs and then choose which one applies the most that could be the most common design
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0206780_0206923	and me look at the mobile
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0051225_0051707	that was just so of a general point there
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0146158_0146540	or they can make it bigger or they can change the feature slowly
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0045351_0045881	which obviously means that we're gonna have to combine to whatever
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0232530_0232698	because we're at lunch time now i think
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0153020_0153426	younger age group and then grown up the market later
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0147756_0148224	conscience when you realize the the r s i ask you again and again and again
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0123366_0123469	it's a slipper
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0191820_0192107	yeah it could be on that okay
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0184190_0184550	for such simple questions because we're focusing on that yes okay
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0154040_0154364	if she people were between age of twenty to thirty five the best
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0137001_0137251	yes it will appear to sections of the market that
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0103167_0103614	if it's any more information i can email you extra details is that okay
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0206728_0206856	we could look in that but
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0078855_0079091	oh it's firetrucks
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0097607_0098356	slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for repetitive strain injury
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0017791_0017931	can i grab the
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0114818_0115453	so and i think it's of general knowledge people do find problem solving videos and i
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0200218_0200588	so it's you can see a bunch of things corded up like a boat
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0019400_0019512	aphasia
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0230012_0230375	five i think you might get injured but
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0044440_0045351	when you press anything it would the chip would convert it into some form of value date
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0158124_0158361	business kind of class type people
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0143394_0143531	yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0207989_0208367	well other than you're trying to make it
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0024903_0025738	so i decided i have a look at what other people decide and try to take some inspiration from that
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0186123_0186346	what other questions
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0090332_0091220	but that's quite a high performance you know international tour or something that's bit nice of looking
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0192773_0192946	retreat with the doctors
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0142436_0143060	yeah maybe two as it was included in the recipe of a restaurant
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0123800_0124766	the third thing was that we hafta make sure the car is very much and correct in to the hands set
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0189772_0190169	you sit it in it's chair when you're not using it or at night or something
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0220670_0221444	it's kinda takes the place of having a button to press for the date and having the button to press for the calendar things like that
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0226198_0226844	and we've talked about they're being an arm or something a beating for being lost
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0013633_0014340	discuss between what our buddy was and what we wanted to look like
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0008031_0008152	oh no that's okay
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0207410_0207989	well then you could put a little bit in the corner of the the mall
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0080544_0080661	you
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0059104_0059321	it's not working
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0112627_0113386	and anything about that on the motorcycle or something like that
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0077302_0077469	and it comes like if you want
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0128591_0128772	it's gonna be very around the world
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0060673_0060814	it's cooking
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0191928_0192056	yeah on that as well
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0018212_0018341	thank you
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0106034_0106148	oh
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0206040_0206644	obviously into the design while also making it quite different from anything else that's there
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0121865_0122367	use to find it needs to be something that you're saying whispering
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0219067_0219618	making sense of having lots of things you put in for date
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0229731_0230004	or should i just generally look at all the questions and enjoy
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0101820_0102050	so thirty five and on is who would like those two feet
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0172808_0173473	but just discovering the different ages and telling me we're ready to use them on mobile phones
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0036880_0037334	as i said about the which bathrooms we were gonna choose
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0127142_0127782	it's gonna be different for a few year old and for somebody who's six and so across the world for nine to ten years
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0184469_0185430	but we should focus on making the umbrella as possible because a lot of them are just tiny little writing and lots and lots of lots of pages
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0116582_0117240	in fact i've just called up that table there we asked those two questions the table really wants to know
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0188854_0189772	well they they they last quite a long time and if you had the the thing that you get with umbrella houses
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0148581_0148982	oh i think that is still a kind of question ask you how we deal with that
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0019224_0019332	oh yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0232414_0232555	yes right
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0047240_0047388	and then finally
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0176511_0176914	that's a free aspect of our service would that not make it more attractive to them
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0180251_0180354	oh yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0113429_0114281	we didn't really look into that but remember we found that finding that most people only use about ten percent of the buttons
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0077551_0077886	oh i think we catched about it at the end
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0019684_0019789	alright
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0180470_0180828	uhhuh if it was something as simple as you couldn't change the channel
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0173473_0174307	that's kind of what led us on to compare tv networks with their design features like caron websites
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0091790_0092588	for example you can see behind the window seven fifty percent of use your person stuck back in the tree
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0208703_0209017	that's that's sends a really attractive idea
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0151286_0151974	or speech reconstruction which is extremely expensive i think that's the only way that you can have a voice
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0166423_0166641	you've already got the number's for typing in anyway
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0111510_0112232	you can record straight off the tv anyway so on to on to the tv high drive or something
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0174307_0174740	you can pop in any time with a phone that you bought for them if you've got any problems with it and they'll fix it
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0023844_0024692	everything is just some sort of situation to change the state of the tv or other appliances that it's sending the signal to
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0190169_0190674	but it doesn't really matter because it never really runs out because it lasts a long time once it's started
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0203150_0204079	things that are so obvious to the company in value trying to coordinate that into the design of the project
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0051594_0051715	and
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0132750_0133469	but mean because we go to make it original
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0107683_0108058	so could we not program a video with this remote control
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0130021_0130539	so are we talking of a single multiple or maybe five six designs and all that
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0106856_0107844	it limbits the cost of it but also makes it easier to understand for the consumer
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0134432_0135394	so it's a little panel that you touch rather than a button which shouldn't wear out as much either not sure about the
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0085725_0086149	so that's where we started our our business
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0233342_0233739	three i think you can email me if there's any more questions
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0095591_0096272	it's the slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing fifty percent were probably frustrated by that
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0199279_0199946	that's very strange because you turn it up so they come over with something like this covered up so here
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0165894_0166237	and you wouldn't need a whole horse as extra bountiful for that
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0125931_0126371	people paying more for it to look good
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0036119_0036880	now the main complaints i came up with were obviously the pause for the batteries because otherwise it's not gonna work
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0169347_0169912	it's been around for a long time it's just it's not very well attended as to how to use it and things
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0221444_0221589	it could be
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0112245_0112700	we assume that it's still got play and stop functions and recovering
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0003704_0003883	oh alright okay
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0190909_0191734	yeah and if yeah if he had one of those just coming back to the other point about pressing the button and saying off the blade in the room that could
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0225709_0225935	that's not the moment i recall it but something were looking at
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0061180_0061367	it's it's okay
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0010062_0010181	complicated
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0051707_0051903	and that's yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0219960_0220091	so they were looking at the guy
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0126492_0126781	we needta focus on that as well
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0089695_0090332	eighty percent we were quite surprised by that finding
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0027266_0027489	doing with the inside really
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0222671_0223557	and it also played library in the instruction manual because it's very simple so putting it down in words should be helpful
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0197718_0197875	okay so we've got a slipper
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0196261_0196662	and we mean so many more courses look absolutely incredible
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0213830_0213973	less chance it being lost
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0209017_0209569	have not come across anything like that before if it kind of yeah and that opens up into your flip book
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0193074_0193261	so the race where you be your
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0169104_0169455	and it has been around quite a long time
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0175078_0175985	it's worth while with with our own kind of service so that if older users were determined from buying this
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0154752_0155002	we we're talking about
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0097238_0097521	they just can't be bothered to learn about the questions
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0087219_0087626	just they're general use of the motor control you know see we had a hundred subjects there
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0081185_0081594	whoops
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0081740_0082067	but more
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0043307_0044180	we've just got the power going to the infographic the chip and the yui infographic
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0209833_0210338	five nice to hold in the palm of the hand and just because you're having it to actually assist in between the two covers
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0052766_0053017	okay thank you very much
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0205260_0205875	or something something along those lines to be able to cooperate quite
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0216283_0216461	what we can think of fish
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0146528_0146951	the entire engineering design is gone to remember the same yes exactly
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0232273_0232423	questionnaire
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0174740_0175078	they're going the company you can use their telephone
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0083679_0083990	thank you for that close a little bit
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0080959_0081103	we just do the best we can
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0004768_0004918	oh
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0134069_0134462	yeah yeah that's what i was just yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0009263_0009912	we decided on a university course one hundred set for all tv video
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0101496_0101820	that turn reviews in the old age group
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0076762_0076903	so and over all the
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0022885_0023358	well a device which basically just sends the signal to the tv to change it
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0175985_0176511	if they know they can just pop into one of her high street shops you know which one is i press for this
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0117928_0118404	see how the the yes no sort of value across the age group there
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0180125_0180592	taking your tv and you're control and saying look this is what i'm doing it's not working what should i do
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0080309_0080569	oh i got to keep this here
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0220232_0220665	is this nothing to do with the progress is just that's what i'm on facebook
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0008593_0008870	oh go over what we decided last meeting
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0233929_0234196	and i'll be up to not answer them
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0153426_0153757	do we really hafta go for everyone right away
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0159538_0159772	you know focus on where the eye will be taken
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0195498_0196249	because then you've got the representative training you know matter how much you try to make it simple
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0110866_0111006	yes
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0199151_0199252	yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0199946_0200218	and you don't have to you know bend your thumb too much
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0172320_0172808	can i just run this past you while it occurs to me i don't mean to quickly jump from one subject to another
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0033769_0034754	yeah that well you can't get the so so certain around one but i'm just wondering about pacon's company and how much you needta send the daycare course
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0080345_0080468	thank you
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0123385_0123711	but that's that's sounds a lot cheaper to me
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0110905_0111510	yeah and if you've got a sky one of the sky police there
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0084009_0084398	he should be able to make it
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0163884_0164486	because you got your general record anyway so if there's a program on you want to put record on
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0029482_0029852	wife and you don't need to send very much information
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0048772_0049534	it should be different enough from the entire project to get a good committee
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0196662_0197058	things with the same color buttons all crowned on the service
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0059548_0059679	function that yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0109550_0109781	it just said for tv only
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0183125_0183634	there's no extra the person hasta walk to a shop on the street
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0073649_0074378	yeah with that i think we'll be able to achieve common sense of scale so we can give it in more features and make it less complex
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0128772_0129154	at the end of the day the the engineering design is one thing
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0207096_0207273	what we're looking is to make it more
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0042276_0042828	it's not a proper set i'm not sure if it work or not
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0064255_0064919	so probably as a result of i would put it to simple as possible
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0103869_0104058	write
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0166237_0166555	you just need what because you've already gotten numbers there anyway yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0080875_0081185	oh i hafta move it
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0118404_0118899	and a special number of don't knows the old age group i think that's just a little fee
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0223519_0223739	and the recovery
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0143672_0144196	so okay so you're visiting disney
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0081594_0081740	and it monotonous
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0016119_0016324	okay
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0063691_0064255	and i haven't had some much cooking yet and basically everything
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0135290_0135625	well no because you wouldn't hafta you don't hafta press or you just
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0077886_0078435	okay so if one wants to write something down they want to bring up at the end
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0074762_0075212	that's so this is if you ask me personally i would make a
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0072814_0073649	as we see we we have to make a profit all so we we can go for an economy of a high production by fifty million we
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0212165_0212769	oh you could do different like you get with momobones different fashions
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0051715_0052358	that's a very important point that came up in our market research finding two so i can refer to that whenever you like to present
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0230717_0230976	construction because they're ten to be a
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0159772_0160276	the first is most likely to be taken up first of all where the main person is coming from for a project like this
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0229266_0229414	yeah i think that's us
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0164486_0164979	but if you do want to take something in two days time you're not sure if you going to
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0192253_0192616	so i was talking to a group of people
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0096272_0097238	thirty four percent of people said they take too much time to learn to use and i think that tires you in with the the previous finding of people only using ten percent of the buttons
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0136652_0136766	oh
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0201381_0201563	because it's kinda moved to your hand anyway
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0166569_0167039	oh i'm not coming across that function but it sounds wonderful
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0115453_0115669	so i don't know if that's something we needta look at
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0171461_0171636	exactly
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0127782_0128591	what is attractive to a woman and what is attractive to a man
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0153750_0153940	we could focus on the bigger picture
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0182307_0183125	they will be a customer service number thing that you can phone up and speak to and that way they're no call out charge
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0146796_0147715	it's gonna be the same so we needta focus on just one thing not get bogged down in lots of different possibilities
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0181366_0181542	oh i think so
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0202482_0202746	we wouldn't say exactly smack my little girl but yeah smooth
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0223912_0224048	oh
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0030249_0030387	now one
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0022501_0022885	what the first thing question i asked was what we trying to decide
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0132038_0132750	what about you were talking about the buttons the controls or coming out now have kind of big
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0198846_0199279	because we have a flat one it it looks like a box
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0169712_0170288	but i think if a war is kind of brought to the front front about that
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0215162_0215553	it seems easy but nice to handle
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0007420_0007886	write or january for today do you want me to give you a second
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0109419_0109550	don't know what you think
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0229455_0229731	what would you specifically like marketing to look out about before the next meeting
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0157418_0157983	but i don't think we are focusing on that i think we are focused on a certain
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0198282_0198846	what i was thinking of a design which came up with almost six or seven years back
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0194291_0194770	the the shape you got trendy
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0179443_0180041	the function of it in the sense that you're sitting there pressing this button and your tv's not doing it
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0210880_0211441	you know even though we're using plastic
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0197058_0197764	we definitely and oh an obvious thing that you get away from these brown records we don't want that
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0011216_0012023	we decided it's important to relate the company's income and our project's you know that kind of thing
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0014485_0014869	went it to look online and dancing to the
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0114281_0114818	but i think that those ten to be the basic channel hopping things and on and off for the video fast forward
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0208341_0208598	well we needta think about how it's gonna look different
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0158340_0158878	just thinking of bureaucracy uses two for when it does get to the center
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0193338_0193963	yeah yeah that that that would be fine and also that would mean they wouldn't hafta go out buying baskets all the time
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0091220_0091790	current move controls do not match well with the operation of the user over there
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0176922_0177063	okay
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0165402_0165877	it's not anything like that it's just number
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0200744_0201169	so what happens is you don't have to press your thumb too hard
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0148982_0149485	alright i teaches to be caused by repetition of small movements
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0186957_0187714	but we should think about because you've got the umbrella between overbodies that's what i was thinking about
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0185430_0185816	it does you just put it in the dryer until something goes wrong and then you try and search for it
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0120074_0120646	we do have a budget limitation that we can't control ourselves
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0224964_0225675	we've got the buttons but i think we'll work through that with the design of it
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0102724_0103167	oh i had marvelous tales and things that i could just keep you but i think i'll just keep it simple
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0092588_0092783	so again that's poor information there
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0187956_0188561	the the especially made for the for the mobile phones
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0181827_0181972	construction
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0218236_0219067	in cutting down the number of steps that was kind of step by step that was kind of step by step
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0031970_0032302	can i inject to ask a question there or that type of thing
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0180828_0181323	but i mean for if there were any more or we're absolutely deficient it's only gonna be for tv
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0061477_0061620	yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0151052_0151322	oh no and it becomes ridiculous yes i know
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0094690_0095591	the big operations that people found were were something that you you mentioned earlier remote controls are off even lost in the room
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0219412_0219960	yeah so when they press for programming it comes up on the ol cl rl rl rl rl rl
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0082660_0082831	oh okay i've got it more of the cat
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0100548_0101364	but we're thinking of now is even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleed every now and then until you find it or or flashing light
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0029852_0030249	most of them are poor by some form of poverty
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0209569_0209833	then it's nice to you can make it white plastic
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0225935_0226310	well professor so it me come around to market research at some point to see what people were like
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0035461_0036032	now the one at the moment i'm small but i'm just wondering if you could look at something a bit small
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0211441_0212121	you know you're thinking of the design you can get in plastic we can do a nice cone shape or square shape etcetera
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0042828_0043307	and i'm not even confident that those the real way you'd write it up but anyway
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0227308_0228085	but they're not gonna be that that many functions in it so it should be fine and the the instruction manual
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0228085_0228384	and i don't know if we deal with that
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0098896_0099689	the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like a little christmas celebration
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0200379_0200552	that's right correct
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0122886_0123385	you're going press the button on top of the tv and it beams you know okay it's over there
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0109768_0109931	with that invite you
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0032617_0033253	yeah if you look at most of the movies they're quite chunky and that's because of size
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0053017_0053235	we you like to continue on that
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0100431_0100548	smack something didn't put them
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0093454_0094252	and possibly we can also cut back on course if we don't have so many functions actually on the remote control
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0164979_0165402	you put the number in and it's just a number it's not a date
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0185840_0186028	okay
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0044335_0044440	but it was basically
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0183396_0183560	like i said
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0081300_0081424	you know it push it a bit more
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0144633_0145286	maybe for u s and all you can have a slightly bigger room you know you needta have a small you know
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0064919_0065298	and to somewhere i i would say it should be usable by being easy to use
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0163198_0163315	yeah yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0122367_0122886	maybe on the tv you could put a pack on the tv or something so you can't see the room
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0049534_0049953	we were talking about it before and also just something that i was thinking about
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0151424_0151723	yeah speech recognition but yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0098356_0098896	you know those small movements of the remote control can leave kind of kind of slow and slow
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0109929_0110099	two yeah yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0106240_0106856	console is only going to be for tv it's not going to be comeback
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0017650_0017791	okay yeah okay
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0171608_0171863	so that yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0000818_0000982	it's up there
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0231160_0231851	deemedized thing there everyone's got a big pile of them but noone really uses them
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0185816_0186123	so that she be something we think about
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0201249_0201901	so it's always good up so you can have a
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0117240_0117928	would you prefer an lcl scree that's small and a lot of fun for speech
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0041918_0042276	and so this is what i had as the basic idea of what we wanna do
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0201997_0202359	the way you hold of it's kind of semi circular in the bottom something like that
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0154022_0154151	yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0125490_0125856	funny story i mean what you're talking about with the marketing
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0138337_0138495	alright
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0228984_0229266	yeah and different from what's out there
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0225575_0225709	oh
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0215455_0215628	yeah maybe he could come with some fire
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0166940_0167575	is after if you look in the newspaper tv guide or any tv guide there's a five
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0023358_0023844	whether that be the power or the challenge or the problem
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0102050_0102645	that kind of evening out thirty five to forty five and in the old age group kind of versus versus
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0221346_0221738	so it's kind of doing away with the programming feature
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0017503_0017732	oh no that's fine
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0206981_0207096	oh
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0138496_0138917	but also august as we're saying with the different designs
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0025738_0026006	but oh though we will wanna be taking
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0118844_0119020	yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0040149_0040724	but not much people do so as we're applying to the most obvious that should be fine
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0226542_0226773	for decoration right
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0019596_0019726	firetruck
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0092792_0093454	about fifty percent of uses only use ten percentage of the buttons so again a big design house there
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0178286_0178408	oh
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0033253_0033769	they hafta be obviously this and this side to fit those categories
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0117659_0117763	alright okay
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0087633_0088097	or findings lots of fun some of them here
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0205116_0205242	let's see
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0170208_0170330	yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0053591_0053854	oh maybe maybe makes the ladder over
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0212769_0213100	you could have different kinds of cakes
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0232559_0232680	three i think it's time for us too
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0109781_0110213	but i mean general tv shows do do video as well
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0160471_0160942	okay so the remote control functions
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0229030_0229156	yeah i think
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0185334_0185586	puts people reading them so they do the office yes
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0213100_0213867	you could have nice ones for younger people and sleep ones and
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0104172_0104485	we have new projects
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0165687_0165894	yeah yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0130630_0131204	well yeah you could have a number of different designs i mean inside that'd be essentially the same
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0066315_0066622	like volleyball or championship changing the championship
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0162240_0162351	very poor
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0158878_0159335	you want to you know not waste too much money not be professional
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0210338_0210880	that's gonna take care of some of the bread i would think
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0069035_0069351	can we put in the middle part of the flip top
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0060486_0060728	the blood hasn't come out at the bottom
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0133869_0134201	you know with the touch screen computers
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0016324_0016680	three presentations i got right here so
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0211055_0211171	yeah we could look in that
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0086149_0086670	the company we did useta get a cross section of the general public
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0149607_0150179	and i really can't get my head down to prove to you that it's me have to be sposta be sposta be sposta
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0188561_0188987	but they come with the carriage i mean you could bandle a carriage with it but
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0194770_0195498	you don't wanna big box with lots of things you don't want a tiny small thing either
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0160942_0161612	we've got the tv with got the video no there's
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0227005_0227308	learning how to use it should be as simple as possible
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0080727_0080950	you know this kind of
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0156520_0157418	now with the baby bumbums the old generation's are actually larger than this young people
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0089076_0089559	we found that seventy five percent of users find most them cool
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0103476_0103651	yeah that's right
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0184229_0184510	and that yeah they should be yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0171863_0172203	but just have that function would be very good
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0216798_0217196	because i just quickly go over the new project reports so that i haven't missed anything
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0131349_0131665	the friends could be same and the body could look slightly different
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0133620_0133736	what about
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0144196_0144633	you're visiting it according to the courses all the time
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0183560_0184036	but i think it's been two much of an event for a phone maybe he might walk down the street
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0021250_0021849	okay this is the working design presented by me the interesting disaster
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0059477_0059630	essence
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0181972_0182307	but i mean there's a couple of services
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0137206_0137531	but quite
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0039212_0040149	now these have a wireless range of up to about five miles which is so useful for anyone who's watching that tv and less they're in a cinema
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0105110_0106034	we're not going to be using telia tests partly because of customers consider it outdated with the internet now
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0204322_0205260	for example if it was a sea or something like that you could have it in a vase shape that opens up kind of like a shell
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0186346_0186957	we're not sure if we need a design design now
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0164781_0164911	just walking the numbers
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0154265_0154787	and when we've been throwing up our ideas we're oh absolutely taking about business people
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0181639_0182014	mean interesting books i feel i read a lot
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0184036_0184327	but for a moment he will just forget the money and all that
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0131327_0131716	yeah yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0187714_0187922	one about phone batteries what kind of battery is that
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0052171_0052865	alright okay and yeah that's what i came up with that say if you wanna
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0223739_0224192	was there anything else there that we in the new york project
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0126734_0127142	yes further market research will be needed to kind of focus on what that is
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0103460_0103591	okay
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0135518_0135840	you don't have to press it just to put your sum on to it
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0190674_0191003	so something like that should release the size of it
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0101364_0101496	possibly
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0033595_0033876	triples the small size you know that's right
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0006681_0007420	okay this is the second meeting and i might be bit over the place
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0027489_0028055	yeah i ran out of time so i couldn't do this one as fun as the last one
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0013141_0013633	oh oh you can see it okay
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0088097_0088814	the overall thing which i've got at the top there in italics is that use his disability the book and everything
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0181323_0181622	yeah okay just a thought
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0110444_0110888	well well you get combine tv and video videos don't you
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0084171_0084387	got it right over okay thank you
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0110365_0110586	well i don't know because the if you
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0192552_0192970	yeah some sort of ducking station or yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0067462_0067737	so what the concept is to have a flipbook
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0202640_0203026	can you look into the company logo
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0155203_0155496	the type of company that we're working for is well
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0021996_0022501	okay this is where i went a bit mad with part of it
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0060745_0061098	oh no yeah it's just crying
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0152211_0152875	do you hafta instantly you know looking at the findings here because of course on
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0017101_0017584	is it okay if i pause that until later i just want to get exercise to a little bit more information
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0000020_0000483	help they
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0145256_0146158	think we have to decide one project and then the company can take it wherever they want to in the sense that they can make it smaller
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0032302_0032675	you're saying the trip's a small or other car or carriage or something
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0034754_0035461	and which leaves so of on to the next point about them being small and easy to carry around
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0016866_0017062	should we hear from marketing first
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0161750_0162392	can't remember what it's called the little code at the end of program details yes
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0099689_0100431	again that was too easy i think in when they've lost the actual remote control some kind of speech recognition
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0082370_0082509	where am i
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0127940_0128210	with the ll cl dl you only have that with the principal secretary
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0208230_0208684	just kind of pushing at that to see if he came out with anything but you know i totally agree
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0179203_0179843	well not sure how long we've got left but we needta make a decision about
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0141328_0141902	it just raises another point well it occurs to me it kind of applies to both or designers here because i'm not sure how it would fit in
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0080189_0080629	okay can we add in an attraction to close the fountain
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0154292_0154798	rise other buttons they're in very disarray and they're not consistent with with other materials
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0220136_0220425	for yeah the bicycle
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0065014_0065289	if you mean you switch the tv on then you put it on the side
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0213084_0213742	and finally the boy could be chasing the cat
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0149237_0149677	the first thing is basically on design video just took the input from the previous meeting
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0165863_0166384	the production of certain products which i already explained in advance the
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0086484_0086645	and we threw her over to the field yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0012298_0012602	the minute's from last time
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0195004_0195515	the bottom we're gonna have the umbrella the umbrella
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0222260_0222540	oh so i didn't mention mentioning this but it will be occurring in the design
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0085412_0085659	the annual ball for close of the year
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0074990_0075189	yeah precisely
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0148998_0149237	we're gonna show you something which i did here
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0222656_0223061	because i took it from the feedback you gave in the last meeting from from your report
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0129264_0129906	you could have a flat screen inside but i'm just wondering whether we want an el cl dl screen inside
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0169125_0169527	so it could be very
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0164442_0165203	so have the the volume and the program things like that on the lower side
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0005239_0005447	but and that way
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0150290_0150802	the picture shows what the standard models offer by computer companies here
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0076724_0076992	one of the questions is sorry
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0175745_0176007	it's that play and stuff and things
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0115672_0115851	yeah yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0163243_0163660	you got your ol c d display there and you've got the buttons there so you're holding it in the palm of your hand yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0105188_0105650	but i was thinking more of the buttons because the buttons which they've said
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0134989_0135328	actually for some reason it's very odd
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0024946_0025060	it's okay
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0226432_0226842	oh i think that was you talked about a beaver for location and we just created that in a valley
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0052412_0053316	the the the cavalry because most people have the life on the room anyway so they could get when when you got tv
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0189054_0189228	but you
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0176016_0176429	yeah the one you yeah yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0191274_0191588	okay so you've got the battery
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0036755_0036949	don't think so not yet
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0134192_0135048	you could have some sort of style that you could pull out but i i think they could get a bit easily lost because i had
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0210871_0211662	the if in a year's time we be get feedback from the design figures that show something else is coming and it's so easy for us to just pursue that they could be slipped on
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0162868_0163243	if we just use the shell as an example you open that
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0076992_0077461	you know which one would last the longest because we don't want customers to be you know charging a lot of money over there
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0058725_0059062	but i i think the the next one's the best anyway
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0056054_0056835	but i mean not many you don't want to limit your market
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0218025_0218991	five we were talking of voice recognition all the time because that we have not agreed on the choice of how to look at remote control if it's lost
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0191588_0192062	the inside computer is pretty standard across the board isn't it
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0131449_0132237	if the whole thing is gonna be good to open up and see something quite funny inside
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0189425_0190016	one of the decisions we hadta make was whether we hadta
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0068504_0069132	because i just ask referring back to the solar charting is that comparative with standard batteries
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0094603_0095211	you could put them vertically right next to each other and have a small small switch on each one
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0185833_0186520	but i think pretty much we useta keep relatively cheerful and simple things
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0068163_0068323	that's not the right
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0204917_0205635	is that really going to fit fancy look and feel which was the major thing people wanted
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0192189_0192592	so there's not really the situation to be made there
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0183573_0184148	then it won't be cheap to
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0008544_0009352	write this is our collective decision meeting i think we're quite a bit ahead of ourselves
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0209428_0210011	and you would have so many different options that you could do
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0065588_0065718	is it really gonna be an umbrella
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0227763_0228698	that seems to make sense but if it turns out that's huge expense we'd hafta cut down somewhere else then it's worth thinking about
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0011269_0011501	so i think we've touched a few things
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0219083_0219306	so are we looking at a boy or a girl
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0077618_0077833	yes i the
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0148592_0148738	okay oh
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0064002_0064729	but then if you think about watch it's on your own body the whole time so you're walking around
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0197709_0198266	for the body design i think plastic yeah we could use the body
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0071725_0071915	they they especially they don't
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0188079_0188197	and you could yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0195977_0196170	so you repeat that last part
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0192808_0193128	the buttons what did you give us as a
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0118872_0119263	well that's been really popular with my wife and friends so i don't see why not
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0194471_0194948	on the top one okay you got the touch okay and then
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0055701_0055969	pretty sure that cinderella is from the sun
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0187652_0187765	yeah okay
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0079932_0080195	yeah i think it would yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0050799_0051223	mean can you pick it up and then wind it for two minutes and then that's it for the night
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0157634_0157921	so basically a person you know point and
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0180270_0180650	so we agree on
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0078967_0079783	well you know how long the standard doublet would last
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0051215_0051688	yeah yeah oh yeah i wouldn't hafta ride it for very long
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0153441_0153591	you see this
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0172555_0173179	but yeah we can take insurance from the vitamin companies like the vitamin companies or right
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0094354_0094603	if you see how thin the tracks are
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0053146_0053294	that doesn't count now does it
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0182425_0182687	it's a
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0164949_0165076	and the
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0128876_0129431	if we for example had a shell yes it would be yeah yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0164344_0164499	okay and you into the
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0152292_0152729	and the second thing is there's too much confusion here
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0039096_0039596	especially if you do them on too tight and you can't get the leverage on them to underdo them
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0139363_0139573	yeah yeah that that would be fairly simple
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0114170_0115100	because of the expense of how much tuition is it's it's light and strong but i think it should be left for airforce
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0190615_0190857	so it's a lot small so
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0202008_0202770	you know we could make it black and white dresses
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0069823_0069960	like a shoe
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0228698_0229151	but i think we find out more about cost afterwards
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0226150_0226432	did we i know at the last meeting we spoke about a beer
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0012602_0013372	we had a couple of changes in our plans in that we couldn't use tea tea
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0199597_0200180	and it is just oh what's wrong with your speech
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0212288_0212491	you could talk of a
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0132981_0133449	it's not another idea i don't know if it helps with that but just to do with the
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0029420_0029974	well i should point out that the first of those findings is the most important
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0220154_0220323	oh yeah yeah the wheel ones yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0223061_0223585	it's not just a case of having a little air hidden somewhere they do want it to be obvious that it's our problem
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0011664_0011891	to do with that already but we'll just go over it
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0186520_0186655	elisa's not chief
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0173301_0174236	too many words and like for example if you see the previous life
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0219094_0219334	yes it was just a costume with that
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0019333_0019451	we just cooked up
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0136485_0136741	if you keep bouncing with the point over
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0000002_0000202	oh wait until you're all wet
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0128514_0128876	so sorry to interrupt i don't see why the car thing is a problem
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0193474_0193716	the bar board ll cl dl rl
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0187432_0187668	and mean they use them in captivity
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0138042_0138503	just one small question before you know this thing regarding the soccer since we have been having a flood
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0112823_0113240	yeah in in tennessee i don't think it would be a little really
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0025849_0026370	oh so with our company being four hours in putting fashion into ten one
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0073243_0073799	it's it i think they're not very resistant to dropping
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0146202_0146611	it's trying to think of other features we can build in it wouldn't cost too much but only be leave that one on the side
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0220425_0220813	so we can if financially voice communication is not feasible we could go for a visa
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0074029_0074161	oh they're not dissatisfied
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0035432_0035654	be interesting to see what are divine people make of that
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0109818_0110496	whereas if you come to plastic they can be a little more they can do some sort of course
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0178865_0179014	okay
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0050494_0050799	how what kind of long can you get out of that
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0032413_0033086	we found from our consultations in paris and milan we've attended all the design and fashion shows
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0065538_0066039	yeah but then again i think it is because if you think about it the watch
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0125060_0125310	so i didn't get the last part you know
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0042252_0042507	okay first the
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0210011_0210708	you could have a plane flight one for your little
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0059834_0060386	the amount probably moving around you be doing all the time would would charge you up
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0148117_0148530	oh i think we'll be forget about the middle that was just a very quick passing thought yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0068323_0068437	yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0163533_0164442	that's what i was just saying and then have the elcda at the top and then be able to touch that for the other courses
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0205544_0205727	it's different
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0189165_0189312	you went like back up
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0229151_0229325	write and go to trap it up there
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0085715_0086369	it's not something that's come up in any of the facebook groups and market research it's not a thing that people are looking for
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0132839_0133139	yeah i hadn't really thought of that to be honest
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0058059_0058272	but then it would be hard for the day
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0129595_0129708	if i must understood you
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0125566_0125997	just what you said i didn't get the meaning of it completely you know
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0081231_0081853	shouldn't we do some market research on that first because i i personally write okay
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0184800_0184921	think the only
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0146938_0147093	you mean you could do it
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0232570_0232677	is everyone happy
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0075365_0076057	mean categories you don't really throw around a lot unless it's remote you know
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0225419_0226057	the point is that it's got to answer out somehow but i think it does without that so i'm not worried about that
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0135045_0135233	there were hafta be a touch
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0133449_0133915	is it possible just an opinion when we open up people can use their fingers to press the button
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0181831_0182425	you know that it sits in then pressing the button and then having so we could interact voice and then communication for the finding it
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0116388_0116511	umbrella yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0136802_0137175	yeah just thought they wouldn't actually need one and everything they've gone through
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0170898_0171243	so we we can check into the financial feasibility of this
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0048454_0049370	so we i saw the the standard double layer and triple layer which we thought were a bit bit too big for the moment
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0030783_0031218	so probably that the feature that we put first is still important
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0223838_0224119	since it's the only one it's kind of kind of
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0028144_0028599	four right then the the current functional look and feel of remote controls
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0108608_0109417	quite there's quite a few decisions that they've gone on the shape of the case
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0109417_0109818	if you go for tuesday they can only do a standard bookshelf
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0159281_0159776	so he you know not use the pointer to keep changing the channel if a person is following
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0112363_0112923	so is that a vegetable or a tomato or something
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0064729_0065014	you're doing things it is moving a lot of time
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0198266_0198782	for the inside and umbrella as padding or for the grip something like that
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0162747_0162868	isn't that the idea
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0137175_0137398	so they didn't really need a
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0198820_0199377	so we decided on a rubber cake for the plastic shell of variety of designs okay
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0226986_0227165	yeah depending on the expense of it
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0208684_0209080	we looked at those movies and mean the are kind of ordinary very simple things
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0155214_0156212	we're going to have maybe july july in the middle of the flood and gruffie usage in in computer
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0084553_0084817	you you wouldn't lose it so much
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0031218_0031695	but it's third in order of the the subject group we looked at
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0117608_0117718	it's something like that
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0186500_0187432	well it's it's it's not as expensive as it would be if it was full color because if you just go black and white one
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0221703_0221964	and in comparison to the company logo
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0188370_0188958	yeah but we took about kentucky charlotte we've seen to decide on that do you think we've decided on that
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0216871_0217586	umbrella's on the bottom side because it's plastic
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0212456_0213177	you could take it wherever so i think that's quite a flexible thing
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0036742_0036901	oh yes
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0190840_0191062	got you on that okay didn't realize
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0132237_0132764	now how would you describe if you had it bear how you hadta press
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0038856_0038972	and i hate those little things
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0100491_0101417	the case now i've been sent what the faculty can actually give
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0037104_0037309	yes thank you
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0142893_0143138	and they kind of respond to the turn of your body
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0101417_0102327	the there's the plastic which i think we were gonna go for anyway as the main case case housing and
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0040302_0040472	thank you
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0133915_0134516	or we have inside like a small point or something
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0110496_0110920	but whether whether or not because we'd have it in two separate unions
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0125432_0125558	oh well
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0058272_0058872	the point is that it charges through the day and then you got it charged for the evening
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0022936_0023239	the merits we use to decide on
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0226877_0227640	depending on how i i mean we've got this mama saying that it's something that the company's looking into so
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0008008_0008387	well come back everybody hope you've had fun
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0148283_0148597	okay okay
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0161564_0161743	because if you think he about holding it
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0216382_0216871	el c t say on the the top side of the flipper
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0153118_0153286	like some some people have
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0176145_0176343	oh that volume and you know
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0016044_0016539	we were thinking a shell but something along those lines just a different shape from what's normal
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0053742_0053910	alright
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0226030_0226150	okay
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0099218_0099999	but you could have lights behind the windows and after like five or ten seconds and not being used i have that turned off
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0039387_0039590	oh i know
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0145952_0146152	yeah no no
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0142008_0142721	now you know how you got some minutes in nightclubs that are members when you turn to them and you turn away and it gives like an advertisement
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0111147_0111276	engine yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0077497_0077618	oh
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0116500_0116979	that you give the sunny feel that also allows us to kind of have different feelings for the phone
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0138503_0139147	we can compose the two songs for different types of buttons like we are keeping the standard buttons in the thing
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0139147_0139304	so we can divide the soccer you know
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0206423_0207105	so you either want something that goes with that
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0180781_0180899	do we agree on the battery
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0224476_0225035	you associate the name with the individual project that it is and that does the work for you
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0070774_0071499	if you like on a category they they're quite big and they're all they look at
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0165562_0165774	so the finishing are too many closed buttons
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0131235_0131449	it's a good to have a conversation
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0107867_0108482	the problem with the cake is that there's
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0077596_0077934	so we hadta look at the life outside
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0118463_0118836	very quick way of changing the look of it and people can just buy one if they want
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0076239_0076697	yeah they've got jell things but the the batches are small i think
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0175151_0175720	so we we would not change this most significant thing in all the world because this is the most significant thing in all the world
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0086804_0087020	but something to put on the side to think about maybe
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0035729_0035965	okay thank you very much
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0231623_0232110	we only had forty minutes to discuss what we just discussed and don't know how long that took you
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0001757_0001913	oh good grief
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0028599_0028955	the old old one i remember to be ten twelve eleven
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0054598_0055216	so maybe it's started tripillia might take less a space or a daughter might take more space
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0072299_0073132	yeah the whole bunch of races would be the the
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0147093_0147921	you could have a because if you just put the full charge through an lcl dl dl dl dl
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0223557_0224476	well they do but you could well it is i think you just dress that with attire
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0134328_0134463	one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0210551_0210871	well the thing is the umbrella's going to be so really keep to use
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0087220_0087329	okay well move on
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0160312_0160780	but on the top we have this button umbrella to keep completely changing the channels
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0111124_0111763	yeah and the second question is a movie you can change the color you call it a skin or whatever
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0078600_0078967	butries on the side of the jar
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0193636_0194134	yeah the i think we were going for the
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0141902_0142008	if we slipper open
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0153591_0153741	does it on i
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0117621_0118084	those pens that you can pull that out
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0118192_0118395	it would be comfortable to hold on
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0195625_0195847	okay okay
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0069148_0069726	you know they could leave in the sun light for a couple of hours or so you know they could leave in the sun light for a couple of hours
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0217586_0217853	that's how far we've gone so far to our sessions here
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0140740_0141112	because in the actual flip but you'd have some lingering
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0034013_0034785	there also seems to be a train train train in contrast to last year
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0021898_0022800	okay so we decided on our market and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0135041_0135232	but easy to repeat as well chief
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0071449_0071648	to that effect the experience
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0166384_0166613	all of a sudden incident
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0128504_0128659	oh so with the
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0017939_0018862	and our market was going to be young business kind of range
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0077962_0078479	yeah the the if he had something using the standard
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0031695_0032413	okay no the fashion up there which relates to very personal professions
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0029974_0030639	it's twice as important as the second one
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0034785_0035432	so a lot of interesting feedback there about from our market research department and from our people in paris
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0213742_0214102	it should be more it with the design in such a way you can change it every time
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0159878_0160312	so we're having a combination of books so on the simple book
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0184662_0184793	and i think that was be quite fun
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0137738_0138096	yeah that's the end of my
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0080978_0081433	because if we're doing the concept thing and it's
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0129140_0129293	oh it would be flat inside
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0067333_0067624	and the for the same the same reason
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0198019_0198162	plastic okay
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0116994_0117621	so instead of the fashion that comes off being plastic the fashion that comes off would be the rubber
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0144866_0144989	well it's a book
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0166613_0166912	okay we had a little bit of voice recovery there was a little bit
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0167049_0167557	but minutes that or a few minutes have developed a new speech recovery
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0201858_0202008	so we could make it read
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0122835_0123831	but i thought that an l c d type of screen because one they're incredibly thin and don't take much space
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0158012_0158431	but he just has to click on that particular button he just has to click on that particular button to complete it
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0088899_0089550	which basically has these contracts that really close together and then when you press down on the umbrella
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0203384_0203662	so we could just pick anything
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0156418_0156912	yeah if yeah if you have buttons that appear on the screen and this
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0205521_0206423	it's just different from everything else and i mean i'm trying to imagine cleaning houses
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0169527_0170446	or some kind of sound or some kind of sound and if this can be incorporated this would be more you can say trilling
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0209080_0209463	three this would definitely different enough i just wanted if anybody could come up with something even more
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0182295_0182473	yeah i mean if
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0055103_0055725	yeah the dinner would take more space because you'd need a physical support to withstand it
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0181145_0181306	yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0017331_0017939	and we were gonna think about the port and an alarm for getting it lost things like that
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0042623_0042742	into the mother
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0060386_0060805	you don't think you ever needta actually physically start shaking it up to make it work
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0147921_0148233	but i don't know if you could get any more information on it
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0203764_0204429	is that going to be the theme of my head of something kind of shape like that maybe about that size
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0059062_0059834	the the kennicott charging which is you get it in risots and you you don't even notice it
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0111763_0112363	so in this case if you're looking at a a customer can change the color from green pale green to cheerful red or something like that yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0096908_0097666	and then to yeah so to conserve battery life for a long time while it's not being used
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0172153_0172555	they want something to do with food so i wouldn't say that design should be a food
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0084951_0085271	but then maybe that's looking at someone who's just sitting on the ground rather than
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0060854_0061353	and oh this one of the kindergarten it it runs for a long time
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0211630_0212456	and once the one's that have surgery you know you could just go so far with it
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0122465_0122835	the second operation they off of the boston
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0158431_0159281	and on the top representative buttons which you know could be on the pointing device
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0018862_0019193	okay so she we start with the first presentation
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0163508_0163805	yeah yeah but you can't do it with your thumb
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0065289_0065588	then you pick it up to change it and then you put it on the side
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0075916_0076308	don't get worried but don't worry
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0113240_0113765	well you could make it a little bit in the tightening
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0016897_0017210	you were going to look in to the recovery bathrooms
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0187746_0187925	maybe we could start with the black and white
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0207105_0207294	which is what's on the market anyway
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0044473_0045055	because some of the things that we looked at last time on unfortunately i don't evaluate
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0045266_0045596	findings i got my nice little picture there
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0215226_0215710	okay we got five minutes or that might be up for a while
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0054083_0054598	we have to take into consideration size versus which one you think will be bigger because we we have to take into consideration size sizes overall
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0144989_0145772	you're saying watching tv are you gonna go have a shower and do my hair before the
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0099999_0100304	if we decided to go for buttons that could lie up
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0047486_0047853	and then we we looking into bankruptcy offices
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0160946_0161428	can we stop that round so the one's that we use all the time or on the bottom part
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0161877_0162283	you would be using your son's to press just like a umbrella
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0079650_0080160	it would just describe from the transportation of the whole feature it's not gonna add anything okay
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0215644_0216382	so can i just recap for the decisions that we made kind of a recap
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0041083_0041188	okay
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0115944_0116500	as just wondering if we make the basic model out of plastic but have a rubber cover that goes over
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0053378_0053790	five i thought it was youve
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0091816_0091988	well kind of things do you have to consider
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0049370_0050219	five i thought that that might be a little bit silly to be to be honest people it's it's basically like ride up ride down
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0155824_0155938	which means
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0053232_0053491	there's just a lot of
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0146099_0146202	okay okay
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0229632_0230258	and meeting now yeah so
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0036429_0036582	yeah okay okay
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0009601_0009826	yeah yeah i was getting that impression as well
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0024933_0025119	so pretty much
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0185031_0185833	but i think the only phone that we would have would be how much it's going to cost if that means we hafta cut down somewhere else
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0200180_0200831	we're gonna try to make it a vegetable or fruit dish or something like that
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0204429_0204917	made of plastic fits into the palm of the hand rubber
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0129906_0130571	it wouldn't be like full color it would just be black and white but they'd be touch touch buttons
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0113765_0114170	it was just it would be so expensive to buy a new car for it
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0056191_0056303	artificial life now
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0189926_0190502	know the kinetic ones come come come come with a lot of water
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0232171_0232396	and i think we're pretty going in a clear direction now
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0168273_0169125	but we had responses from the customers that they would like to have the feature of finding it
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0145424_0146099	it's with as using the ideas from oh boy so kind of got side tracked on that i think
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0056835_0057300	mean people who live in business class there's not that many people but there are
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0025656_0025849	so that was one of the first things we did
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0062662_0062874	because they use them quite frequently
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0071528_0071765	so all would be slightly bigger especially
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0096359_0096753	write of witch witch i'll speak about in the next book so that
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0102459_0103250	the the main problem with the well you could go for good but i think it would be a bit complicated
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0033505_0033912	so you be thinking of using something like that in your move control device
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0162257_0162492	now you could flip it open and you'd be
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0155760_0155881	so what is that stand for
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0154928_0155214	okay and second as already discussed with firstnamev
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0137923_0138131	that's you right okay
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0150802_0151570	so you generally see there's not much of video and like movie people made people they're boomo back and forth
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0019210_0019333	okay
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0111136_0111242	for the flip phone
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0071616_0071774	expensive as well
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0046596_0047486	base on your foot and it's pretty much used for all all tv movies at the moment
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0047986_0048454	there's actually no recreational office
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0119182_0119294	hmhm
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0013372_0014280	it wasn't gonna be a control for everything and that we hadta coordinate the engine of the company into it somehow
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0144533_0144638	they don't look at themselves
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0174354_0174537	well yeah we
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0115444_0115944	oh i've got a umbrella on my hand for myself which is tremendous and it does mark very easily if you drop it
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0098463_0099218	so you can see what all the buttons are like on a movie phone
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0072058_0072205	it's two point four
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0170446_0170664	and technological innovation all the time
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0071774_0072311	what kind of price they were looking at for a normal bathrooms of the type
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0033086_0033505	that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes shoes and furniture
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0025119_0025656	we decided on the most important aspect required to come to that letter
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0144155_0144495	we're marketing to guys as much as we are to women
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0050012_0050260	one right okay
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0009477_0009969	from the last meeting i i i think yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0130571_0131188	so we wouldn't be pressing down on them all because we could have umbrella
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0153858_0154292	one found the one on the only common feature is the jelly and the vegetable and the vegetable
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0156212_0156505	how i
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0050219_0050626	so you wound up your right arm control before you use it
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0127015_0127827	but you wouldn't have with the elcda you'd have the wife coming off you wouldn't have that with the
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0232867_0233179	oh okay
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0219578_0219981	maybe maybe a couple of verses you put on keychains
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0230519_0231255	so it says closing we have forty minutes so i think we probably go about that time before we come back
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0152729_0152905	one and two and three and four and five
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0122071_0122465	over if you had them close enough that would be one option
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0104324_0105188	well you're saying that people like this sunny feel this year so perhaps something something maybe a umbrella
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0023460_0023678	current trends and so on
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0188073_0188307	that that would be good up grade later on
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0029089_0029420	of course as we progressed that it should be easy to use
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0105785_0106024	the they've put across
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0184148_0184662	so do you recognize that's a good idea that where's the remote i'm here thing
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0068177_0068398	so it's not the draw and it isn't
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0151570_0152116	so you generally see rectangular shape very monotonous kind of designs yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0075002_0075156	particulate yes okay
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0137437_0137923	okay we'll talk about that so if you finish here and we come back to that
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0036543_0036742	and like one has the questions about that
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0182707_0183573	yeah it is quite quite cool feature to have and also if they've got these parts already and stuff
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0081629_0081912	we add it to think about
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0227609_0227779	and they've gone and stuck so yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0091988_0092807	can we what kind of size does it come in varying sizes or it's it's one size and we would hafta fit the design of
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0064990_0065140	yeah and
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0176429_0177106	so keep that's the most common feature across all malls if you look at all the malls it's here
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0194134_0194770	on on the top one we're gonna yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0225035_0225419	obviously we'll have a lot of it just like everything but everything else has a lot of
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0021791_0021898	yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0080799_0080978	can we think about that
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0167557_0168273	we have to check into the financial feasibility whether we can in corporation this at a low cost
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0051688_0052412	but i don't think it's really so of necessity when you you think as the next two options
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0174609_0175151	one i think most of the users would know be very connected with this certain network here
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0106153_0106991	what is used in some stressful management and it's meant to be anxious
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0053961_0054086	but anyway
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0199200_0199392	oh i think so
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0171623_0172153	my personal references would be as always highly valued by marketing department
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0057116_0057532	four i know it's different part of the world two
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0049745_0049886	what can you explain that
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0097666_0098463	well i was thinking about that because sometimes when when you have these things i've got little lights on behind the bushes
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0219334_0219636	but it's a good idea to check on the cost as that right
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0211662_0211788	which is another beauty
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0106991_0107867	oh i'm i'm not sure how that would work because sure your friends would still be moving over the short distance but that's what they said
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0117431_0117601	yeah a rubber slave almost yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0143138_0144102	is it possible that when we open our flip top shell it's a little compact metal and then goes on to the fun display the the other one cool display thing
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0026370_0026908	we all so looked at a fashion using our collections on fashion and design in paris and milan
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0092714_0093013	well the the the thing about it is
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0117863_0117973	alright
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0156891_0157538	you have a good amount of i c u something you have is a good amount of gra
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0055977_0056085	yeah okay
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0197144_0197260	and for the story
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0149677_0150290	especially from the marketing and insurance to check on the customer's needs and feasibility
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0038097_0038352	they're screeching like that you know
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0116863_0117008	and you can peel them off yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0212137_0212251	you can
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0181306_0181831	that means that there's no function for the port
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0115209_0115444	it does mark quite easily to if you let it fall
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0196178_0197020	okay on the flipper the top one is gonna be the rubber
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0043948_0044473	also in this study i've written into the evaluation of some of the individuals
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0057514_0058039	yeah and most people also watch tv in the night anyway
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0036149_0036391	let's start from the inside and work our way out
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0202770_0203384	but that's not really what we're focusing on what we're focusing on is the you know yes
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0189474_0189743	and now thought of a remote control with the flip top
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0010093_0010200	let's see
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0150760_0151132	because they they were saying they were quite willing to pay more for better production
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0080119_0080264	yeah that's
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0029767_0030462	it would need two separate pcs that would be joined together through some sort of cable
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0088855_0089231	so maybe because there's more space it's not kind of moving around too
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0206619_0207514	oh course are below budget with recommendations that they the budget be exceeded but i don't know what do you think
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0056932_0057098	so i won't write all of that out again
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0151558_0151753	break the window
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0157060_0157389	twelve point three five
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0166372_0166561	perfect evolution
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0211269_0211781	and i think it'll be another other project or two to look at at those kinds of things
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0202851_0203137	there are innovations and that people don't really want
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0119730_0119868	so what's the single care then
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0107878_0108004	you want me to put that
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0007631_0008203	and the river runs that way
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0055519_0056226	yes we'll discuss each one and we'll come to a consensus reading between one and seven
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0020371_0020670	but how do you say it's yeah yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0184842_0184984	but it was nice having it there
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0160473_0160647	so half of the price would be
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0102431_0102558	yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0211781_0212244	don't think that's something we hafta look out and find a way to reach it
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0201108_0201817	it's really good that this has been very market research based because just going back to mexico
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0097280_0097564	one and one good
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0184614_0184842	alright then having to email it
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0153981_0154491	as you say we can offer the voice organization initially to business classes
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0065308_0065495	oh it's four
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0077244_0077443	one point seven five
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0023655_0023993	yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0028476_0029174	the be standard transmission with the tv using all the standard chips that we took about
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0125843_0126008	it's including
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0089806_0089981	write
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0051764_0052317	but that did see to be the favorite strategy but there was also on the side line the thought of maybe having a beaver
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0060022_0060152	how about that
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0071665_0071800	it's very slightly o t
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0142747_0142880	if we
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0046975_0047249	so this is the first stage of the evolution
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0052880_0053466	just show you how we're going to evaluate our own feedback to this to what we have so far
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0049991_0050845	it should in comparison to the two main ones there were the sunshine texture and the food vegetable strong disease
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0157389_0157688	was it twelve point five
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0092561_0092947	and finally last but least easy to learn
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0062886_0063141	my own writing for that would be a two
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0199206_0199556	but people could have have anything that they wanted
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0082589_0083208	the the the sunny feel would be in the umbrella that you put around it
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0146418_0146869	and no because it's it's a simple simple simple
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0096899_0097072	logical
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0139789_0139960	oh no it's just prices one
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0042707_0043170	it's to be presented to me
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0141642_0141956	we haven't been dealing with dogs or anything
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0040229_0040867	oh no not interested with the the whole look of the the the project when it's out on the thing
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0153309_0153981	but our objective is so difficult that in itself it's gonna make it easier to qualify as you know a first instance
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0015277_0015894	it's gonna have a plastic body with a sort of standard color
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0124252_0124459	it's you're not using a lot of water actually
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0079543_0080152	so i'm just thinking before i give it my writing you were limited in the use of materials for your prototype here
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0003390_0003552	okay
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0085499_0085694	we've really touched on that a lot
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0096244_0096449	so it would be but yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0026723_0026955	he he won't show out i'm here or something
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0146869_0147206	he took a way that that'll make it twelve point three five
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0058075_0058416	it's where i realize
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0203137_0203687	people people wondering a lot of the phone they're really happy with them and they can't get it anymore and it's innovation for innovation
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0168369_0168523	yes
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0048836_0049116	one of the findings that we came up with just a recap or here
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0020479_0020798	the back and white white tuck the cream over in people can
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0033228_0033450	it could be here also yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0193678_0194216	because this was something we should think about but obviously noone's put any great deal of thought into it
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0099508_0100102	but it's for in corporation's current fashion trends and is easy to log in
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0061602_0061753	okay
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0045421_0045600	okay
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0119093_0119208	slipper
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0203973_0204308	well it's enrichment for money's sake
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0040867_0041709	and finally that's the company
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0009468_0009897	me and firstnamew is going to make a presentation on it
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0094033_0094237	we were happy with the cost on that
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0102690_0103123	for most of those routes it's high enough for us to go ahead with that
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0182963_0183503	yeah i think we probably would have used the automobile more had we actually
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0082154_0082482	yeah yeah yeah and
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0047249_0047547	one the collection of criteria as we saw in our previous meeting
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0189996_0190296	yeah it's new ideas and general
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0215214_0215890	oh so we've got about fifty minutes to catch up with everything that i found behind
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0010325_0010586	make sure the camera
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0162370_0162501	oh
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0093601_0093754	oh boy
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0048158_0048619	so what we discussed in the last meeting are we actually meeting those friends
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0152756_0153037	but we needta work to that specification to start with
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0169504_0169624	yeah that's it
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0191709_0191888	well they hafta come from somewhere don't they
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0213821_0213994	it's tough secret
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0042426_0042675	so this is the one
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0173955_0174893	and i i feel that everyone was listening to and all the points that were raised seemed to be sorted out
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0103308_0103946	on the basis of current technology and or current capabilities we could actually do much more to minimize that
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0146133_0146305	oh
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0059577_0060022	actually it might be a idea if we each did give our own individual rating and we could take a vacation at the end
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0116994_0117120	oh right okay
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0071037_0071182	is that what you're saying
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0070603_0070757	yeah i just told you that
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0219792_0219958	it's a
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0058297_0058533	just right smack
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0212398_0213152	oh i think we've done very well to get within budget and it still make such an investment item that people are really gonna want
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0039904_0040303	but not interested with the outside kind of look of the project
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0213477_0213648	maybe it will
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0151180_0151459	but we're still working to head
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0220460_0220881	was that not the question for the how you felt you done in your
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0205290_0205582	because the fun's of moved on things like that
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0220084_0220492	well i didn't hafta rate you on how much you enjoyed the meeting this time
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0155506_0155799	because we've done all the back ground work to go for that if they want it
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0008858_0009029	protein
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0072117_0072286	just two point five for that one
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0167748_0167997	apologize we discuss leadership and teamwork
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0169656_0170315	oh that we had a separate test the was so much more than what we needed to run off each other
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0150154_0150760	but they but i mean in i don't see why we hafta settle for twenty five years now
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0004709_0004997	good to be a problem fixer
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0002738_0002856	okay okay
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0195447_0195953	they they don't really think about it because normally the remote control is the product which they're trying to ship
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0114509_0114789	what's happening with the elixirs
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0155625_0156026	they like the gadgets they like something that's completely different
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0080152_0080387	is this actually going to be the color that you would choose
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0118064_0118366	yeah one of them and one small speech
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0165580_0165807	exactly voice communication everything is
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0060152_0060278	okay
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0119850_0120257	yeah i'd say it was yeah i think it's
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0125385_0125843	so we're not actually using plastic in the case or anything
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0208471_0208983	and the heating for the building you think our budget includes everything all the costs that are going out
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0137358_0137594	and they're going for a standard battery
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0034391_0034801	and then finally on the internet
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0063870_0064567	yeah i probably put it two two or three
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0017582_0017838	but we can't come out with that
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0104500_0104817	is there anything you would like to ask me about the finding before i
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0141989_0142114	well i think it's a umbrella
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0080340_0081046	oh no the the the base curve was white or or all sort of light blue
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0033990_0034391	so when you've got it open it would be facing the tv
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0151568_0151710	we can put in our recommendations
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0057098_0057436	it would just be right one two three four five six or eight
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0062660_0062886	one is two seven it falls
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0022666_0023422	thinking about it now because you could probably get a
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0072878_0073085	one one is good through so many it's wonderful
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0204238_0204421	yeah yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0154748_0155625	make the price fit and then say if we had our budget we would have had this because it also sets up our account
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0193197_0193678	meanwhile there's a little different so someone's been shut in the room and said make cars a different from everyone else
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0128633_0128764	yeah okay
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0124679_0124956	oh very quiet a little
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0074155_0074366	okay easy
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0147361_0147641	if we change it to the battery it's that's nice three
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0074366_0074483	easy to use
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0151326_0151659	so she would just change the dresses and everything
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0148868_0149309	we can do it some other way we can do it doesn't have to be voice recognition
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0102290_0102604	yeah i think yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0130421_0130825	yeah the puddles one and two and three and four and five
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0023549_0023655	yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0113715_0113995	see it would've been handy to have this at the beginning
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0025272_0025780	so you'd shoot out where where is the remote and
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0115809_0115964	oh no no the
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0169188_0169806	or did you feel like ottoman
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0091763_0091965	twenty one
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0027237_0027350	one i'm under the sofa
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0172218_0172557	we came to a very pretty place
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0122756_0123099	one i think umbrella since it's been used just as a casing we can put point five
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0081861_0082312	so we could use any strong fruit vegetables and that's what we're looking to do
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0149309_0150037	we could do the voice reception for you know business class or something like that
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0084388_0084676	that part was nice and easy
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0146166_0146338	so we see what difference it makes
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0154997_0155203	and then say we recommend
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0204308_0204544	that the people hafta keep buying
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0073581_0073734	so that is eight
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0024997_0025272	so he presumed that they'd also be quite cheap
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0021493_0021601	oh right okay yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0003272_0003390	you're good to go
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0029123_0029262	umbrella
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0010830_0010982	because i just know
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0216751_0216948	celebration you're gonna talk about that
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0140518_0141065	you you might be assuming that that is in europe
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0204579_0204892	as things that you know they might want to buy the thing they really want
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0184151_0184614	yeah because we could just say sorry what did you say about that
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0077566_0077898	oh if we want to really bring it down we can
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0163626_0163776	knife knife
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0126728_0127172	but it's gonna be part of the total cost and there's no way we can put that in is there
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0175366_0176275	and i think we've made it into the final project if if we've seen the marketing before the initial specification was put out
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0191020_0191204	that's mine
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0055079_0055182	oh sorry
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0027108_0027237	okay okay
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0082600_0082771	yeah because you'll be having a
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0217288_0217464	if that or we'll be dancing on the dance
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0178669_0178828	like that
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0139563_0139785	it's not made any different
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0074599_0074946	base on what you said there i would say one two
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0197713_0198494	meanwhile they could even go to you go in with a
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0194451_0194929	we've got d v d p as anyone remember the umbrella
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0196007_0196202	yeah the voice isn't on to that yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0203687_0203961	and i think it's wonderful that her company's so awesome
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0180677_0181283	maybe we should think of burning out into children's toys and fake mobile phones as the side line
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0126045_0126679	so that shouldn't be actually on there because that's not important you know
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0073734_0073991	that brings it down to two nice and simple yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0160150_0160473	but it's said fifty percent is the cost
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0209994_0210623	so maybe increasing it you would also hafta increase the price of it
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0097153_0097308	yeah one
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0069005_0069175	oh no
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0096324_0096449	he built into the tree
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0004093_0004564	stepmother chip because it can come in various different sizes it wasn't
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0172964_0173137	and cinderella you completed the work very well
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0140434_0140639	it's not a lot there
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0144422_0144689	but i feel it's customers never said anything about the bakery
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0112668_0113201	we just tight numbers into this and we come out with the fine vacation
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0192299_0193197	as was shown by your presentation with all the other courses noone's thought about it particularly
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0015894_0016555	but we're thinking something fairly useful like a white or a light blue or something
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0056304_0056520	one is two seven it's four
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0044834_0045037	oh i think this is a good shape
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0012537_0012988	you have one of those things and you can just take it off
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0067463_0067945	okay okay be quiet and be quietly and quietly
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0153037_0153309	and i think the boy's regulation sounds wonderful
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0000368_0000686	if you leave them on the whole time you get a new one the whole time
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0173296_0173446	how did you find it
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0073099_0073313	so you're writing for this one poem
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0047547_0048158	it was based on the use of recipes and marketing strategies of our company
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0041912_0042199	and i've now got evaluation criteria
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0111261_0111373	now i assume
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0141567_0141760	but i don't think so
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0208960_0209296	it was just the production cost of the film
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0137735_0138224	it's not meant any if you click off that square no it's not made any difference
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0087136_0087889	well the type of button that we're gonna use in the bottom half the miniature miniature
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0122178_0122445	plastic one and maybe a little point five
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0095126_0095345	oh i think it's
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0139161_0139263	and cold flash
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0006122_0006812	and right funny decides decide to invite the hip kind of feel
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0031988_0032552	and cinderella would be on the the the bottom ladder
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0031657_0031836	and the umbrella
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0084803_0085294	moving on to does the size minor strain injury
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0157505_0157721	two point five
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0053466_0053913	going to use a seven point scale where one is true and seven is false
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0171331_0171714	yeah i think it's a very constructive feedback by everybody
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0020670_0021549	it would be sort of upset into the top and the bottom would so so it's funny close flat
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0010362_0010480	and i can hold it
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0005672_0006122	buttons with a combination of elc t and rubber compared to the size
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0152684_0152856	we we
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0140346_0140507	it's sort of it down slowly
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0127172_0127484	there's no way else we can go for the the rubber used in the cake
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0120693_0121171	and one yeah one's double code and then the other one's
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0125714_0125931	oh no that's it's as an extra
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0071496_0071665	so i work out the office for that again
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0006812_0007631	and to try it in comparison to our decision until we can find out more about the cost of things like that
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0154493_0154605	okay we can
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0104035_0104199	oh
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0050845_0051764	the design should minimize as much as possible to use a voice voice recording as to whether to use voice or not
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0111791_0111963	that
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0068895_0069292	one that's your bicecup and the the designer
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0120168_0120283	the dog's
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0168536_0168736	in the sense that
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0209117_0209327	oh i think that was just the the physical
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0066132_0066551	two and three quarters is right
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0125948_0126093	write okay
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0077898_0078492	well now that we're looking at it it involves current fashion trends
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0125074_0125261	see it says case military
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0103784_0104040	do much apart from having a huge big
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0011655_0011774	and we're crying
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0060095_0060228	yeah so you can
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0179596_0180250	well i'm still not caught up
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0012988_0013135	then
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0196176_0196984	but then when everything is really smart and you've just got this big chunk of black thing sitting on your coffee table it doesn't go
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0063252_0063448	one is two and seven is four
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0147540_0148015	yeah but you mine three plus two
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0216954_0217203	the slavery is the twenty five pounds
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0094276_0094535	yeah yeah that's feasible
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0159456_0159566	it's less than ten feet
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0017838_0018731	the white choice of colors and so of paintings so you've got a lot of customers with it
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0033080_0033210	yeah yes
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0088191_0088855	maybe because it's quite small but with the amount of stuff we're putting on it is that much
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0021549_0021771	yeah yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0158800_0158933	it's twelve point five maybe
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0161940_0162069	kick off meeting
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0162472_0162610	so we're under the umbrella
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0013863_0014453	okay so this is a book
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0148079_0148241	thank you
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0145099_0145444	if if you take away the voice i i don't like that
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0128357_0128636	we should just put it as one because a plastic is here anyway
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0141636_0141773	is there anything on the menu
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0089313_0089572	hey actually the button's in between
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0195222_0195447	yeah just chase it off of it
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0070718_0070863	you want your writing to be a two
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0166948_0167513	because we've gone decisions that we wouldn't feel able to make
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0119293_0119443	two because it's two
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0173184_0173296	thank you
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0070532_0070718	the average for you
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0200613_0201118	and new television programs coming up but nobody giving a much idea to this
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0111556_0111672	that the scream i'm gonna scream
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0213744_0213984	maybe someone's running down and painting
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0214736_0215214	and if got the meeting somewhere in question you know
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0124483_0124648	it would be saying we're using
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0033980_0034152	it's still pointing yes
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0104279_0104500	well i hope that clear to the team
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0086156_0086309	we felt could feasibly reduce that
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0214271_0214736	the project has been evaluated well and totally
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0178399_0178669	then it didn't matter because it was just another idea in the field
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0055336_0055621	is it everybody's going to va
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0216025_0216367	umbrella yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0163089_0163418	so is that gone as covered for the election then
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0072755_0073010	using one dessert place that's okay
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0082405_0082585	and the sun feels no problem with that
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0170315_0171238	and i've certainly felt heard listen to and that in general areas we've been able to you know give and take and adjust our revenue where necessary
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0210855_0211119	but i think in the region that we were given it was very specific
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0083801_0083950	yeah i'll give it a one as well
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0156540_0156796	so we take voice recognition out
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0105090_0105269	it
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0218479_0218677	yeah just last i think
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0158190_0158482	yeah well two point two five times two
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0089981_0090294	and i think i'm gonna hafta be nutritious on that and give it a four
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0221542_0221919	yeah question seven was the one i did just before the meeting
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0176275_0176799	maybe it would've come out a little different but yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0029174_0029767	it would have obviously because it's split over two two different lines
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0145444_0145718	but if you take away the voice recognition then you've got it
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0179060_0179486	well you too created that wonderful species of a plant
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0093733_0094033	it was the i'm here thing yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0071959_0072177	okay and we're just waiting for your writing
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0129433_0129934	maybe a figure for some of the more obvious obstructions and such like columns
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0156347_0156467	okay so
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0042934_0043055	thank you
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0054337_0054894	and i will just do a preliminary writing of all those category on the white board here
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0071117_0071242	yeah i just
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0023326_0023877	so put it in the top section right then the bottom section so it's okay
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0084676_0084803	okay
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0191575_0191709	yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0179596_0179920	and i think that was the best part of the
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0142723_0142945	and the internet
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0145029_0145509	and people are useta buy books and all that kind of stuff
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0013210_0013453	oh well
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0182025_0182333	and discuss which ones you know
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0085694_0086008	we've we haven't really come up with anything that
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0150037_0150218	you could choose to have that or not
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0033662_0033840	oh right yeah okay okay
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0163776_0164224	because that that was just a bolt on exra you could just take that out
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0221156_0221346	but anyway
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0145866_0146022	but it's that special form
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0212327_0212444	yeah it was
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0076642_0077076	two i should have said it two to make the rhythm easy shouldn't
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0182690_0182872	could it have been better was it actually
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0106383_0106722	okay i've got fine here now
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0144016_0144324	the biggest one would be taking away if he took away
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0130033_0130153	interface
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0093454_0093931	yeah it was a voice voice recognition yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0105357_0105464	oh just leave it there
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0057767_0058075	besides
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0005194_0005672	the case theory's gonna be soft rubbery change
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0039240_0039783	lego on it or something involved in the game of the lego on the top
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0117466_0117955	yeah and yeah just no one
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0075853_0076076	to
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0065410_0065609	four okay
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0094641_0095029	because we can enjoy the volcano on that just as we could volcano on tv
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0206223_0206361	in close
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0174893_0175366	but we didn't quite make the voice recognition in there but that's that's good
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0009260_0009381	three i think that would be you
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0205457_0205662	oh there's a cover to fit it or whatever yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0185717_0186263	but i think it's good we spent times individually
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0077076_0077483	well just put all those two because i'm not gonna get to clydesdale dessert
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0072303_0072420	two point five okay
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0094237_0094433	it's going to be beautiful course
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0147212_0147361	well the cat is three
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0118818_0118949	and the double courses
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0026345_0026723	and then yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0129220_0129394	okay special course do you need that
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0219123_0219253	over
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0095216_0095536	if somebody's in the other room or tv's different room or
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0060278_0060896	so just separate the races by alphabet and if we go one two three four we know who's who
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0190483_0190922	it's it's mean nothing is new but it's playing it to a different area
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0183562_0183667	had time to kind of
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0070298_0070429	can you just make it two
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0083501_0083683	and that case it's gone to be a one for me
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0123549_0123800	three i think it's a point five you know
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0202407_0202851	we see it in movie phones a lot and that's where we're bored a lot
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0207514_0207752	do you think that's takes into account
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0138315_0138673	oh no it was seven five it's changed not long
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0164377_0164535	and that would be fine yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0083208_0083491	that otherwise it's just so hard plastic
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0033289_0033662	actually you know it would be it'd hafta be on the front
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0113201_0113484	so i was still on for a kitten
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0160463_0160841	and i think the engineer one was where the prince was wasn't there
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0158071_0158261	so not meaning to do your words
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0176696_0176832	yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0208156_0208471	being well paid kind of a thing
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0193972_0194451	yeah i don't think the the company's really concerned
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0117520_0117628	so it would be two
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0093280_0093454	yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0201817_0202407	and he sees the first change in remote control devices that i can really you know say is obvious and visible
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0025911_0026127	well shot back i'm here or something
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0097680_0098250	but i do realize that we might be being fairly busy because it is our protection of it
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0053913_0054337	we look at each of those criteria that i've just mentioned i'll call that slide up
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0066839_0066952	yeah yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0221346_0221542	yeah yeah yeah yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0078492_0079300	and that's particularly in relation to our market research finding about the sunshine texture to the experience and the free vegetable dishes
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0070123_0070298	the first one reading i'm sorry
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0105433_0105566	okay thank you
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0213692_0214036	her gonna steal her ideas and sell it
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0080695_0080800	with for the plastic
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0028157_0028476	you can have a route that tells you exactly where it is
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0027429_0027532	oh
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0003664_0003952	minutes we decided to use a cat chart
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0162501_0162618	oh i thought that's what it was
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0009137_0009262	is that for us
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0045226_0045415	it's quite similar to what it was before though
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0026214_0026708	or something
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0210588_0211064	yeah i think yeah from the motorcycle research
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0144689_0144939	it's incredible nobody looks into the backyard
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0026955_0027532	it's just shot i'm here or something too simple effect
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0033420_0033651	yeah on the front right side of that yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0153005_0153128	yeah we could say
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0157721_0157907	and that's twelve point two five
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0163055_0163217	okay
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0137174_0137358	and i think we could change the battery
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0141279_0141927	and then we'd be fine because the exchange rate would make it about twelve
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0139752_0139857	well
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0190085_0190483	it's you know bringing things from other areas it's you know bringing things from other areas
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0183706_0184183	had had more time and if we'd been separated more
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0209312_0209994	so it looks like it's gonna be fifty percent project you've still got all of the over heads to come out of that
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0139938_0140207	now you've got to kick off to calculate again
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0198494_0199206	you'd pay a lot extra because it's individually being plastic was being made for you
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0083007_0083114	because of that umbrella
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0102561_0102690	yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0171714_0172027	it's not like people trying to cut each other
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0166692_0166948	we've done room for creativity haven't we
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0121644_0122034	we've got plastic and rubber
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0181444_0181597	well that's quite fun
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0098073_0098582	so how do you feel about this
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0168915_0169188	did you feel like a teen
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0138224_0138383	it was brought it slowly down
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0010200_0010830	oh you're gonna do it and i'll i'll show you the presentation
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0096383_0096845	and if you didn't hear it in the room you were standing and then you realize it wasn't in that room you're going to another room
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0027464_0027593	oh that would be too complicated
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0014453_0015093	and we first look at the area of what we come up with over there
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0159145_0159456	one point year one year
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0010605_0010822	yeah so
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0069892_0070123	oh sorry i i got it wrong
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0210623_0210881	but you're saying that that's quite
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0027532_0028157	yeah well that that could be something for next time maybe
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0157223_0157350	yeah we were close to the bubble
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0163418_0163680	we don't need something else to take that place
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0124069_0124247	what is it mean if you put point five for that
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0119933_0120168	just be a flat bottom with one corner on top of the other
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0120548_0120704	yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0138626_0139126	so it's is uncommon completely and just that going to make a difference
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0143373_0143511	and going to an umbrella
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0151710_0152186	if we if we were working to head off his species this is what the project's working for
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0086708_0087178	he's sitting like that we found some many people did how do you imagine that on such a small device
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0083938_0084046	yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0021771_0022666	and working on the inside with already said decided on the contract
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0118949_0119083	knife knife
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0106722_0107058	and i'm gonna plug this in so you can all see it if that's okay
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0116133_0116678	yeah it's you've put in three for the number of categories there should just be one
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0068777_0068895	okay
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0172027_0172218	it's more of a few books
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0185103_0185350	the whole picture of the thing
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0180250_0180551	but that's nothing to do in the meantime
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0023993_0024362	we decided that the voice recognition system
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0092947_0093561	and we talked about voice research and we really have the designers come to any real situation
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0213994_0214279	well it's it's this conference going on here
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0033648_0034164	but anyway so whenever it's even if it's open here the singer would go
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0119481_0119693	but it has a slightly flat bottom so it can sit
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0170117_0170307	find out from each other yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0213317_0213646	the shame it wouldn't ever get me
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0185416_0185717	yeah but didn't move on the ground
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0221151_0221379	but do you know sometimes evaluate in these meetings
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0116802_0117113	in the top it's the number one
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0049116_0049991	the category that we want in this remote control should be easy to use
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0120464_0120574	one double course
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0142112_0142400	okay so the english here
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0090814_0090958	five okay
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0192020_0192299	and as sorry you go
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0181283_0181419	and fake or sees
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0114834_0115187	it was regular chip on prince and
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0210559_0210707	maybe fifty percent more
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0004997_0005194	we wanted to spend
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0128938_0129220	and we don't step on anyone's toes
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0041343_0041510	thank you very much
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0169703_0169821	and i think we had an nice time
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0081046_0082045	but the changeable faces would allow you to get any basically any one of number of colors it it's full of color
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0204806_0205290	and you've got your hands set that works fine but you can't get the battery anymore for that type of fun
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0138203_0138312	well yes
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0042881_0043105	thank you
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0089572_0089900	it's quite obvious just big
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0059099_0059204	and writing
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0024362_0024997	they did actually say on the email that they were so coming and they were fairly easy to get off
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0139863_0140057	it's not quite it
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0205778_0205904	it was wonderful
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0195953_0196277	they're trying to ship the deity the video
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0146444_0146567	where's the voice recordings
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0142988_0143645	if we moved away from my much loved idea of a quiet boat and just went with the standard boats with that make a huge difference
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0177869_0178399	you know it didn't matter saying what you thought because if it wasn't something that was that relevant
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0173464_0173955	yeah no i thought it went really well and i i
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0009949_0010093	yes so
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0194929_0195222	can't you get the one that were used for the last one
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0090559_0090965	yeah i i go for five at a time because
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0055241_0055377	so they're going to look at these crickets
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0091194_0091503	four and four okay
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0068080_0068370	and i would give that a three
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0101757_0101958	or do we hafta make further modifications
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0057436_0057767	see d e a to confuse it with the number writing
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0201118_0201302	like i was telling everything
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0152186_0152756	we can put in our recommendations for what we the concepts that we come to as a result of the meetings
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0182059_0182550	how do we evaluate the materials we had for communication and sharing information
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0165733_0165921	write so you've done that
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0158747_0158964	are they going to really quick about ten pages
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0191831_0191944	obviously yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0149976_0150154	yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0156026_0156347	it's it's some kind of complete different situation with your company
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0204421_0204579	but forcing it on the people yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0144939_0145209	but shape and color that's something we couldn't compare
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0056716_0056932	write
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0098582_0099508	we've got the highest reading of meeting the specifications that is definitely true for two of the six criteria there
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0215890_0216450	so i'll be delivering in my role as project manager so good luck
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0067192_0067463	two point seven five there you go
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0061753_0062147	crystal the fancy look and feel
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0181597_0182055	means whiteboard digital pens etcetera what does that mean
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0127840_0128124	okay we'll put it in his half
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0086309_0086708	we've talked about points but the very useta be a remote control if you're someone who'sapping
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0041653_0041912	writing it all up okay
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0199681_0200613	separation thing is like people give a lot of attention to mourning mourning and everything like that
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0219181_0219500	oh i think i've got minutes for two of the meetings and then
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0113995_0114217	it might have included our choice
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0095602_0096244	it would be quite loud
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0156794_0157060	then i'll do it
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0158628_0158747	alright
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0062147_0062660	how do we feel about this project
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0196984_0197713	mean if you could have something that's a pretty funny thing a funny idea that's interesting to you
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0120288_0120438	so just one double
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0206460_0206619	here we go
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0101119_0101757	do we feel on the basis of these evaluation finding that we can go ahead and know produce this as a prototype and market it
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0143648_0144016	yeah it would make one difference
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0032552_0032972	just at the front of the we have i don't think we actually put it on
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0141065_0141279	it could be in doubles
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0091965_0092202	so that's four point two five
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0127484_0127676	so do we hafta count for in the course somewhere
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0040004_0040229	oh no not not at the
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0158669_0158815	twenty five
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0002393_0002526	and three apparently
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0121063_0121404	the other course is the sides but it's really flooded at the bottom so it doesn't roll over
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0211119_0211269	oh i think we've done what we're required to do
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0065609_0066132	and those up we've got six and five eleven divided by four is what
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0052504_0052880	okay so we can come back to that slide if you don't have a umbrella
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0077443_0077562	okay
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0105464_0105590	thank you
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0166203_0166372	okay
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0059086_0059303	it's a light maybe it's a light
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0053853_0054232	okay finally shape yeah that would help
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0058148_0058588	yeah maybe it could have a life so that we can just recognize where it is
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0040381_0041267	so these are all things of course to remember with a budget and when you decide to purchase it and when you decide to purchase it
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0011307_0011817	so why don't we look at the presentation to see what we really are sposta do
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0050378_0050675	well you know if we get a really good decision maybe we can do that
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0016519_0016699	so maybe you wanna make some notes of that
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0025468_0025736	okay okay
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0029006_0029219	so that it were correct okay
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0074525_0074986	we hafta just figure that price by having sufficient features to make it sell at that price
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0011875_0011991	umbrella
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0024394_0024545	can't write much
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0030798_0031573	oh i have a very fat cat
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0032258_0032750	would you like just to see how it feels so that you have a little idea
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0026002_0026470	then twelve training try it out the white board but something come through there favorite animal
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0048137_0048262	oh what do you feel
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0065819_0066177	but it could be someplace really obvious and you still wouldn't be able to find it
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0041916_0042758	now the discussion i guess is doesn't any one of you have experience with remote control
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0034707_0034831	thank you
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0027758_0027986	but rather you without it hanging yourself
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0057264_0057676	so it could either be a life would blink
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0060957_0061646	and in in other words if it's like in a dark spot meaning you know new people's on top
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0019744_0020164	here's what the functional design is supposed to achieve
AMI_IS1009a_H01_FIO087_0052326_0052544	almost all the rain
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0035592_0035998	oh well
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0052783_0053265	yeah maybe ten different colors yes
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0066398_0066528	yeah of course
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0077780_0078716	basically you will get instructions to work with and if you have any questions i guess you can
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0037725_0038609	the perfect aim for the company is fifty million euro the market range unlimited meaning international
AMI_IS1009a_H01_FIO087_0006739_0006909	yeah maybe it's
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0019638_0019744	alright
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0071171_0071568	it's it's mainly technical functional
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0057201_0057472	yeah some rehab or something so that we can go
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0079650_0079774	alright well
AMI_IS1009a_H01_FIO087_0047276_0047914	the it should be used for tv it it should be used for for tv
AMI_IS1009a_H01_FIO087_0033158_0033336	okay
AMI_IS1009a_H01_FIO087_0052105_0052326	yeah design should be different
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0079125_0079260	yeah even after
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0067777_0067999	you know well maybe we hafta move along okay
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0031573_0031812	and it likes to sit like that
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0075610_0075784	and i think that's the end of the show
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0066770_0067159	oh yeah well but then those people we can't help everybody
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0079163_0079283	how about you people yeah
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0063003_0063476	it has a center and it gives out a window whether that be a light or a beam
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0075138_0075610	and you you will get pieces of instructions for that
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0056602_0056712	slipper
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0044399_0044923	things you would like to change things you would like to improve with this thing yeah any first ideas
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0028008_0028551	see if i remember how to draw a kitty cat or a rabbit or something
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0027623_0027852	okay see what i can do
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0033357_0033549	don't get too that later
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0071725_0071875	yeah fantastic
AMI_IS1009a_H01_FIO087_0046146_0046571	yes i i feel that all the reminders should be very correct so
AMI_IS1009a_H01_FIO087_0053067_0053246	one two and three
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0072439_0073430	and the marketing manager is coming up with some usage recommendations and what we just discussed in general
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0021157_0021820	the same goes for the concept of individual work which and then discussion afterwards
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0028810_0029082	and remember you hafta press so it works
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0064224_0065078	you hafta have some kind of sentence and i i think voice or clapping that's not specific enough
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0035999_0036482	help the kitty cat is hungry because it's
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0032877_0033282	am i sposta be away off that or okay
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0025279_0025469	after we finished the remote control we get to that
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0040286_0040648	and it's fifty percent
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0015754_0016232	so be original trendy and of course use a friendly
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0067808_0068395	okay yeah we have to move along but i think you have some good good points to start with here
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0065078_0065848	and i know they're the lamps and stuff you can clip on and off but i think they only work to certain degree and
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0073594_0073824	and of course price
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0060567_0060957	okay my my ideas maybe that the minute it's really hidden
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0012611_0013238	the tubes i guess the tube is really important as far as i can see
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0051311_0051812	it should do something different than then just what we have
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0049278_0049524	yeah yeah yeah
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0072011_0072439	so you have a working design and then a functional design
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0013804_0014097	of course plan that falls under the same heading pretty much
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0055123_0055827	that is true because they put the newspaper or they put it behind a plant or you know whatever
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0070746_0071113	so we looking for a working design when we come back
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0042869_0043119	yeah of course useta be
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0053345_0053873	so yeah shape right you know kitten shape feels better in your hand or something you know
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0008533_0008694	one i wanna figure out how to sell them
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0054232_0055025	one another thing that would help is if it beats when you clap because i think one of the big things that happens is if it beats when you clap because i think one of the big things that happens is if it beats when you clap
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0011071_0011307	oh i'm the practice manager for today
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0027468_0027612	you wanna go i mean
AMI_IS1009a_H01_FIO087_0035586_0035895	how does it look
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0062575_0063003	and in that moment it it gets a certain darkness
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0066689_0066793	because people are so
AMI_IS1009a_H01_FIO087_0007661_0008083	and my role is to decide a television remote control
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0069545_0070163	the working design i guess that's the fountain i'd like
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0079652_0079781	oh so let's see
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0063909_0064125	so the life sentence would activate the cycle
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0032052_0032258	and you're funsen right
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0039523_0039851	can't that should keep everybody on their toes and challenge
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0066522_0066689	oh because you're silly
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0069212_0069545	okay so you got the notice
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0048170_0048273	oh yes
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0070163_0070398	interesting design that's you
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0023611_0023838	slipper slippers
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0010851_0011071	and as you already know i'm busy
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0057471_0057593	so if lost
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0048672_0049526	so it should be a multiple function gadget that would control all your household machines basically
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0053809_0053924	yeah yeah yeah
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0026470_0026872	doesn't anybody wanna go and see the white boat works
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0005586_0005769	everybody ready
AMI_IS1009a_H01_FIO087_0057858_0058016	florida
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0043656_0044399	now having us in the remote control for years doesn't anybody really have a idea like things you didn't like with it
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0073430_0073594	that would be your idea
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0077087_0077357	questions at this point
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0021944_0022212	deal decide same thing basically
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0080194_0080361	and see what we can come up with
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0066611_0066715	because it was gone there
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0066866_0067777	and it could be on top of your case and you usually kept it on the coffee table
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0049614_0050276	at twelve fifty years old
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0055827_0056564	and and they some of the phone rings and they wanna turn the tv off and this is what the hell it's my remote control yeah
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0073824_0074169	that it that the prince is a good prince
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0020378_0021157	that is it's gonna be industrial work and then at the meeting we'll discuss what we have come up with
AMI_IS1009a_H01_FIO087_0046571_0046979	yeah those which which we get here now and days it's very long
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0051812_0052107	now of course the other thing to think there is maybe the design
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0063476_0063721	but i mean that we can decide that later you know
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0068849_0069212	did you get notices on your computer for this
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0057674_0058145	if lost bicycle you know
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0022046_0022155	okay so
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0022276_0022645	three different types of design that we're gonna be concerned with okay
AMI_IS1009a_H01_FIO087_0033747_0033963	but
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0071572_0072011	and then the technical you're the technical functions so so you're the working decide
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0024948_0025270	yes
AMI_IS1009a_H01_FIO087_0006909_0007661	and i'm the main representative is useta be in office
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0079796_0080194	then we see you in about thirty minutes
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0061646_0062032	but weather it's on top or it's it's behind the plant
AMI_IS1009a_H01_FIO087_0080408_0080526	okay okay
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0036725_0037272	here's a project fine which of course we all hafta think about when we decide this thing
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0008339_0008533	and i'm a marketing person
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0068207_0068311	yeah good point
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0052422_0052829	early you know it would be something trendy you know
AMI_IS1009a_H01_FIO087_0047914_0048673	conrolling the temperature inside the house or for heating system
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0038740_0039364	and protection cost should not exceed hopefully should be less than twelve fifty dollars
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0042895_0043324	exactly because we we use them right every day
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0006200_0006547	and my name and what your question is
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0037272_0037593	celling price is sposta be twenty five years
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0029219_0029775	well the traditional kitty cat
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0074169_0074465	the price is given but that was
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0077357_0077595	or sessions
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0058790_0059260	and i'm just saying through a single meaning just whether it's a book or a light or
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0052829_0053345	maybe she different colors or mysteries or you know
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0014944_0015168	here's what this thing could be
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0024101_0024250	and deal
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0050780_0051357	but we certainly can try to i agree with her that to mark it something especially it should do some more things
AMI_IS1009a_H01_FIO087_0046979_0047276	and and it should have multiple problems
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0058567_0058790	exactly i mean just that's what i say
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0024812_0025104	maybe we should redesign it
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0006154_0006257	well that's a good plan
AMI_IS1009a_H01_FIO087_0032223_0032416	yes i'm dancing like just to see
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0055567_0055672	yeah
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0006547_0006729	so maybe me start with you
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0012134_0012611	yes opening congratulations two training well
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0030752_0031064	oh that's a fantastic cat
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0045986_0046137	yeah
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0005769_0006085	the first thing we do is introduce ourselves
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0078758_0079163	okay i think i have enough to think about until the next meeting
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0079260_0079395	yeah even i have
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0070461_0070773	yeah it's functional yeah exactly
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0015168_0015754	the thing we're gonna decide is the new remote control
AMI_IS1009a_H01_FIO087_0034799_0034978	and i'm going to drive snake
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0014097_0014616	and i don't think we have any great discussion at this point
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0068584_0068849	okay the next meeting will be in thirty minutes
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0062032_0062575	at that moment it's it's like what you call it the lights sentences you know
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0043324_0043499	and
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0026872_0027252	so in case we have to in the next meeting present something on the whiteboard
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0056614_0057317	well or yeah or if it's really a dark spot that it gives out a sound or a single
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0013287_0013804	we get insurance and we'll take it from there
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0063430_0063763	yeah probably that's the right yeah
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0046515_0046621	slow right
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0076472_0077087	so we have a two two two two three minutes
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0111519_0111649	hold on
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0137802_0138030	and an arm clock yeah that's that's good
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0097752_0098520	and it's the kind of thing people learn by feel and you don't feel the mood change
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0173347_0173463	break the window
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0026131_0026563	so we coming to you for how much as it gonna cost and how long it's gonna take you
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0060994_0061373	and i'm going to talk about the working design of the remote control
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0098176_0098450	yeah yeah you
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0030625_0031175	so i'd like your suggestions to come back to the other slide where i was saying we we could suggest anything
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0186120_0186575	and in that case we could probably mobile plastic isn't all that expensive
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0081515_0081690	and there should be a child
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0010963_0011958	okay well i think we have introduced ourselves so the functional relationship is is part of my goal but one don't pass right to the second slide
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0155734_0156064	so these are the two things we should come up with with
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0121442_0122422	as a useta find out what the fees which which a university would like to have on their roof
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0147988_0148961	and if a person if if patients wants the therapy to be switched off ten at ten o'clock then it should be switched off ten at ten o'clock
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0060245_0060521	the cup cup shape
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0076111_0076315	so can you go to the next slice please
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0112286_0112464	next time speech
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0155070_0155734	and what function working decide how how does it work
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0110652_0111183	you know different shapes or whatever it is there should be a cake to give a shape
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0143608_0144513	so you have different types of emotions with different lights on which you can be used for controlling the different functions of a vehicle
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0055696_0055895	okay that's about it for me right now
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0009559_0009705	you're participate four
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0165367_0166225	whether that different shape also includes maybe different buttons for different groups
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0087557_0088267	do you think there's any chance of having basically the same machine with the same buttons but maybe maybe several different sheets
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0038308_0038440	okay so the something
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0157798_0158314	yeah and i think today they're probably not many people who don't have a tv
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0170623_0170867	do you look at one part of the group
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0085488_0085806	yeah yeah and courses all so different courses
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0185216_0185658	or we hafta try to use the same alphabet and make three different sheets of paper
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0197756_0197905	running finishing meeting now
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0022406_0022828	so it's gotta go to market by september
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0107578_0107880	when ever the tv is on remote control will have a light
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0120107_0120208	yes two
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0185947_0186082	there's the plastic case
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0096845_0096954	umbrella
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0121071_0121245	would you want it full full queen
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0040704_0041353	so i just wanted to introduce check this here so we're not getting too much off track here with with the things we wanna look at
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0109143_0109521	which is like a brain to the brain
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0127901_0128111	on on on the remote
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0105851_0106265	then the remote control should automatically have a light
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0019778_0020047	so that was what i meant there
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0160519_0160975	so i think that's one group that's certainly important
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0020047_0020887	and as i said on the slide they're containing the entire thing is time is really gonna be as important as money
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0066643_0067027	and a remote control is specifically designed to a single device
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0154275_0155070	however the decision we hafta take in this meeting is who is our target group
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0089635_0089884	yeah for sure
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0026563_0027101	and i be coming to you to tell me what's gonna make somebody take out their wallet you know
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0014672_0015069	you could say anything you want and now that how cellular it sounds you know it should run your car
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0085700_0085982	and that you say that won't add too much to the budget
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0083182_0084080	so it's hard but i think it's okay
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0103559_0103774	yeah that's good the clock is good
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0040221_0040704	and that there's no mistake that it could be somebody else who's bringing this out
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0104880_0105030	and the
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0089813_0089969	like a dog or
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0052895_0053566	so gotta concentrate on the features that help you find it and i already said this several times but i put it down in writing here
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0007539_0007703	okay you want me to start right now
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0106384_0106796	then it will be like if you switch on your tv through another other source
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0149547_0149771	yeah and then you can use a timer as well
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0114975_0115139	umbrella
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0086928_0087468	there's a bunch of people looking out if you built one model that don't think that's gonna be square or
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0097647_0097780	yeah yeah
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0109521_0110074	and wife's cooking all chops which should be wives
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0007998_0008644	well could you put my slice up because i think it might be helpful if we looked at the slide at the same time
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0029054_0029206	okay can we go to the next place
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0085300_0085700	yeah that's good from a marketing point of view
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0187816_0188477	so you can have a trip one or two or whatever and maybe something like that
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0179728_0179872	doesn't doesn't matter
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0047965_0048737	okay so my personal preferences in this project are we really hafta concentrate on the style
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0162455_0163223	mean that's a question whether that's important that children can really use it or not
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0027570_0027685	slipper slipper
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0111613_0111738	hold on
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0081211_0081515	they they can be no action taking to that so
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0086437_0086748	it just build the whole basically and you know
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0044093_0044900	and that was thirty four percent of even more important the thing that we did dress in our last meeting that frequently it's lost somewhere in the room
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0057335_0057454	yeah yeah yeah
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0103757_0103939	okay okay
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0169322_0170178	you know like you make nice and pink flowers beautiful color or whatever you know for example you know
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0156064_0156654	so the first thing is maybe a little easier on who is our target group
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0179295_0179446	oh no it it doesn't cost you
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0148961_0149228	so that nobody else comes later and use it
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0197287_0197556	five minutes that was i guess that that's the old medicine
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0096316_0096672	changing modes is nothing for us but people who
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0139914_0140886	and the design of the project would be such way that if a child plays with a remote
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0102808_0103154	yeah you're sitting there already
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0088504_0088682	because that might help with the marketing
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0201207_0201447	so now i understand it's lunch break
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0102753_0103119	yeah and then you can just see you're moving
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0061832_0062592	the mother is in a remote control
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0176300_0177029	but in a family in a age person and a middle age but they can not buy three different clothes
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0053566_0053911	they should be attractive impressive person at twenty five years
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0198668_0198931	yeah maybe yeah
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0120040_0120160	you are
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0085982_0086172	the the shape is
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0145632_0146151	and these are my few personal preferences like it can be used for a military purpose
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0104056_0104880	the main components me need for it's like buttons and the underneath that there should be witch
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0013030_0013619	and i thought that the method i should follow would be gather successes from everybody
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0034686_0035355	we have received instructions from higher up that certain things should not be considered
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0096935_0097875	and and they don't press it exactly you know something else happens and then not their favorite channel comes up but something else and they're very frustrated you know
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0084080_0084245	yeah
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0050250_0050983	you've gotta make it attractive enough so they buy it now now now as a big word in in my book for selling this thing
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0061373_0061644	can you go to the next slate place
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0157482_0157685	oh has a tv yeah
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0159520_0160519	we have earlier it was mentioned about for example elderly people who have limited function with their fingers and hands
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0090440_0091106	and the puddles puddles all i think if you want to have more features in your movie then there should be more puddles
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0173074_0173490	out of the cost we are sposta receive
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0083710_0083926	well we only limited that
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0177578_0177728	yeah of course that we can do
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0168847_0169322	and i think the child's issue can be addressed with a sheet and with colors
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0043738_0044093	it's a lot of them take too much time to learn how to use
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0137124_0137523	and i don't think it will cost much to set an umbrella
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0198892_0199452	but i think to somebody up the talk group is basically everybody
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0018921_0019778	and then the things that seem the most attractive to to a customer will try to then prize prizes those
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0091748_0092561	so i think we needta attend for two or three operations
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0137642_0137890	if there's a clot then there can be a a lot of blood
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0153384_0154275	well my slice show basically we have already done the agenda and on the closing basically they were be lunch break and all that
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0009682_0009830	and perhaps four i believe
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0039112_0039508	and that the cop and decide are being used on the road
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0070147_0070757	and the tv it should translate that into change the channel or something like that
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0173587_0173696	okay
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0034130_0034686	okay okay can i at this point interact something
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0038285_0039112	and the third thing that they wanna make sure that there that the corporate engine is being maintained
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0003732_0003865	okay see everybody ready
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0059376_0059594	can you make it a full cream please
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0111068_0111184	to keep the remote
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0042838_0043738	alright now other things that i found out on in in my research is that the company has about the remote controls that are out there now
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0044900_0045388	so those are two things that we definitely do wanna address
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0088300_0088570	yeah yeah yeah
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0163447_0163714	so these these are just some thoughts i have on it
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0141528_0142412	and i found out in different sites that there are different different roads which can be used
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0122422_0122697	yeah can you please go to the next side
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0194615_0194841	well i think we can only afford this
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0089733_0089875	an animal
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0021364_0021801	twenty five years and make a nice little present and we wanted to be an important person
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0071650_0072292	yeah well that's already been implemented by management so we're off the hook
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0199939_0200079	thank you
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0158170_0158348	don't leave
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0190507_0190650	you know my phone yes
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0157093_0157263	and i guess in many ways everybody
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0157448_0157621	everybody who has a tv
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0103710_0103811	yeah
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0180380_0181272	and i think the how will it function is probably the question of the buttons you know within the car group or subgroups
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0114021_0114147	that's it from me now
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0017633_0018011	it takes five years to develop this it's just something we can't do
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0103293_0103559	and you hafta go somewhere but you just wanna look at the news for a minute
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0102313_0102440	yeah because it's been a long time
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0049802_0050107	if somebody says oh all come back and get it next week you're dead
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0106796_0107456	you you lost your remote control and you you lost your remote control maybe you can find with the light
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0130658_0131316	then the parents can lock that particular child so that the children cannot use that chair
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0041353_0041995	these were instructions from higher up so we hafta limit these things so it's only gonna be tv
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0158314_0158496	they are a few but in general not
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0098520_0099118	so maybe having buttons be very shapes might be helpful too
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0140886_0141138	he he should not be hanged in any way
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0182431_0183428	but the question is how much will that set us back if let's say forty percent we make large buttons and the rest we make regular buttons for example
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0186847_0187426	well maybe there's an idea you know the new portable phones
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0073653_0073867	so you can control whatever you want
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0102692_0102808	yes
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0054921_0055696	and then maybe a lot like we put fashion in the location might be something we can use in our marketing campaign
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0186661_0186947	well i i don't think no well maybe this
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0095879_0096045	yeah it's you know yeah
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0041995_0042510	but the one thing maybe that could be eligible for a tax return
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0196111_0197066	having maybe larger buttons or buttons that's quite different from people either for children
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0045388_0046099	oh we wanna make it as simple as possible or gonna make it obvious and intuitive to use
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0179221_0179323	costa delicia
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0057229_0057449	you want me to get your slide show up
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0134353_0134816	and and and and there's one more point which i noticed down
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0201778_0201922	so that's what we will do
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0160975_0161845	then we have just the news people who can never pass a little button on anything on least it's really very clear
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0052603_0052895	finding it important obviously you can't use it if you can't find it
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0132383_0133347	the road should be compact and it should have as many buildings as possible for constructing different universities
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0117636_0117926	it's actually there on the screen
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0181272_0182218	the question is only whether i will be able to have more than one decide in a sense yeah
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0137830_0138232	yes and as johnny said the buttons can be
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0157657_0157792	deviation from the usual
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0100076_0100251	but we'll get to that with you
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0088531_0089146	but i think we will hafta look at the budget on that but i think in principle that that would be that kind of fun
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0020887_0021322	because if we're gonna sell this thing i think the best time to sell it is a christmas present
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0185658_0186120	and all that's gonna be different is the plastic case
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0147193_0147988	and then to save electricity there should not be much lots of circuit and all that
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0198506_0198918	well we may hafta come back to one or two two points at our next meeting but
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0051832_0052603	we have to as few buttons as possible because more buttons is more confusion so that's why i'm saying simplicity is good
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0010629_0010753	okay okay
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0197944_0198241	umbrella
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0121146_0121371	yes yes yes
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0071692_0072250	yeah but so
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0179808_0179911	that i wouldn't think so
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0060771_0060994	yeah exactly
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0059841_0060125	yeah it's like oh well yeah you hafta dress up
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0102143_0102905	yeah that's a good one because the clock could be really friendly when when it's your favorite show coming on
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0166276_0166737	well you know there's the old pottery children's six never shop along
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0056599_0057157	who would be next i guess that would be you
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0105030_0105851	we can have a book when we are operating a remote control or whenever the tv is on
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0185553_0185747	yeah well that's the question
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0018011_0018921	so the beginning just have a big puddle of things that we anybody can throw throw in and then just weed things out that can't be done for one reason or another
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0200145_0200247	do you agree
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0179132_0179323	that's not really gonna change much as it
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0115370_0116172	and i have refused the page to get new ideas or like what can be the working design to how it works and all that sort of thing
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0176298_0176399	well that's that's
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0167876_0168847	that has a lot of well that has a lot of appeal but i think i'm i'm taking about the fun university now on it rather looking at different groups
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0032924_0033501	at the buddy that we're looking at and at the price point we should be able to make it work the tv the v i a
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0047160_0047734	and i think that those are the things after my research that we definitely wanna try in cooperation
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0200825_0200991	yeah yeah of course yeah
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0158673_0159520	now talking about the traffic group which is in a sense of everybody but i think within the traffic group we have some problems
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0177029_0177625	they would like to buy just one and just one which can be used by all the three
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0036262_0037062	and according to to higher management the it could only control the tv
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0119741_0119918	and french
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0091392_0091748	if you have less features then you're move closer to the window
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0179020_0179123	oh different you know
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0107456_0107578	maybe we can have that
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0126978_0127965	now there should be some time to set for using a particular program or switching on and off a particular program according to the usage
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0108668_0109143	and battery they should be a battery for power supply and a chip
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0149375_0149515	time yeah
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0086009_0086577	you know i don't think it will be much
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0058082_0058319	and you are number three two
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0012069_0012334	because that's where my discoveries started
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0049169_0049802	because one's there's no backpack well and sales you know backpacks don't come back
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0094930_0095705	because they think one of the things people were complaining about is when i found out in my research is when they complain about how hard it is to learn a new one
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0176666_0176809	they didn't really
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0050107_0050250	they're never gonna come back and buy it
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0149124_0149678	it's a lot okay it's a lot
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0121036_0121146	you can make it fun
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0095705_0096316	the changing modes were something i mean you and i all all four of us we work with the computers all the time
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0070757_0071600	change the volume control and so i think it's hard to decide a remote control for multiple devices
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0033501_0034381	maybe something else cute a coffee pot or one other appliance or maybe a lamp yeah
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0112017_0112192	yeah okay you move on to the next slide
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0099118_0100076	you know the a triangle is for the volume and a square is for the surface so that people can develop a table sense of it
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0089884_0090028	yeah that's what yeah
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0021801_0022222	we want somebody to see it and think it's just got to have that
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0169762_0169980	you can make a sandwich sandwich
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0103084_0103293	yeah a lot of time there's not a clock on the screen
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0184362_0185216	that's right and can we can anyway is it even feasible to make one one remote control with something for everyone
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0003972_0004279	yeah i just put on my motorcycle here and i'll be right with you
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0089549_0089661	slippery for children
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0150288_0150602	okay now i have
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0139184_0139773	so even even in the dog the user can know what buttons to use to switch on a particular channel
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0117284_0117607	could you go back to that side but better
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0022222_0022406	and take out their wallet and buy it
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0099002_0099208	yeah shape oh different shapes
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0037439_0037582	yeah yeah okay
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0092561_0093299	if you press one button in one mode then it will change the color
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0066293_0066601	like a tv or anything like that sort of thing
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0202220_0202324	so think you're very much
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0183533_0184353	so to be seen but the traffic crew as a whole is it's basically everybody was a tv
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0200474_0201028	do we agree on on that in principle like money we will tell whether we will be able to do that or not
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0093299_0093901	so if you want to have less button but you can have that one i think so
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0108020_0108277	and then in flood
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0058247_0058379	but number two
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0138232_0139184	we can use the flowers to write up the buttons so different
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0161845_0162455	and i don't know how much we want to carriage to children's us
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0054476_0054921	has to be so great that they're gonna say oh twenty five years isn't much
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0031175_0031708	had the questions to be really specific so that we'll have a list of things we can cross off
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0201029_0201159	okay fine
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0190462_0191133	yeah for mommy phones we have a different you know course
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0197828_0197944	finished meeting now
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0047734_0047873	okay we go to the next line place
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0190982_0191694	but but if then everybody is is is tired of the flood or whatever they have as another one in the package
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0111410_0111519	okay hold on
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0116205_0116375	so it might be helpful if we had a look at that
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0179406_0179688	that that that won't change much will it
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0137491_0137642	yeah sure
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0010847_0010963	there you go
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0186575_0186754	years and a half and a half
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0053911_0054476	so it hasta have an value that when somebody looks at it this twenty five years i'm not gonna take that
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0039508_0040221	so that it's easy to be easily intimidated as a result of the company
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0133347_0134209	and as this is my personal preference that it should be in the shape of a tee and affiliate for more company
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0170178_0170467	but the question is really who is our target group
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0190040_0190371	and then if people really want more colors they can buy it separately
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0110167_0110652	and oh of course there should be a case where we can keep all the things
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0115161_0115274	oh you don't have two
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0179785_0180380	the the question the question to be asked here is who's a talk group and how will it function
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0048737_0049169	that's the selling point the thing that's gonna make it an impulse purchase
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0198931_0199144	if we do some more research maybe we'll get some more
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0179007_0179132	what about the latest transactions
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0108277_0108576	but this is like when it is dark
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0086683_0086926	it's just a shape so it doesn't matter
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0102284_0102486	oh well okay
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0006079_0006733	and i think the marketing manager probably should go first addressing the needs and designers
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0056303_0056460	and
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0035355_0036262	the one thing for example maybe that's the laundry cycle because that's sort of outdated with the internet
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0100079_0100646	yeah yeah and so ten should be very clear so that they they won't be any emergencies
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0128951_0129389	and the tv will automatically switch on at that particular time
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0131316_0132153	and the one of the friend a use it would like to have is the compact of the remote
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0091106_0091392	if they are more buttons then it will be more complicated
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0010096_0010373	okay and now i can full screen
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0083585_0084194	well yeah well that's been a little bit so that's that's unfortunate you know
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0149432_0149547	firstnamej firstnamej oh
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0128388_0128951	so if he wanna use a particular program at say nine o'clock he can set the time
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0202439_0202690	and well see you after lunch
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0188725_0188880	oh no there's a real idea yeah
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0114715_0115075	so we should visit this side and have a look at what's up there
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0175767_0176417	we can design different rooms for different people
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0042700_0042838	alright thanks for that
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0102808_0102940	yes
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0022828_0023485	because anything that you don't have already out there in september or showing it around isn't gonna sell for christmas
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0012334_0013030	well since i'm in charge of trying to figure out what we should put on this thing since i hafta try to sell it
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0090210_0090371	yeah
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0130485_0130598	by the child
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0103811_0104056	can you go to the next slide please
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0096671_0096935	yeah little elderly little tract hand you know
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0146201_0147193	oh no it can be used as a device control as well an alarm clock to set an alarm time and it should have a child lock
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0199452_0200023	if money proves we can ask some fees for some scope of work within that
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0187426_0187816	they have multiple plastic cases you know
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0051054_0051832	and in order to make it really simple we've got a shortening curve make sure it's really easy to use
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0172297_0172966	sort of soup with maybe different buttons for each group how much would that
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0200029_0200753	yeah i think maybe seventy percent is you know
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0182218_0182431	mean the basic design i understand we'll be the same
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0027101_0027851	what what's what's gonna really be what they're gonna really be
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0094196_0094311	yeah yeah yeah
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0103896_0104247	you have got a situation by pressing a button
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0065632_0065748	you don't know me
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0016141_0016636	there for messages will be controlled in the same manner
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0016636_0017055	there should be extra features like little buttons maybe a beep
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0143144_0143839	they don't want to swing at small prince who's functions are obvious
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0136326_0136783	now nobody uses it because you know you're a sophisticated chap and all
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0165479_0165739	one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0146250_0146840	so we have a leg up on time to sell it and push it before other people get out there crosswise
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0116236_0116386	can you go going to the next
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0036777_0037125	you can have the number one two three four up to nine
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0035170_0035689	now the funtion of her movie is to send messages to the television
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0163036_0163363	and i think we all agreed on that
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0123781_0123904	they they are the
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0096094_0096748	so in that way we can cut cut the cost but yeah that we have to make the battery as rechargeable one
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0082974_0083549	even if you if falls down then it doesn't break
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0144676_0144923	it's gotta look beautiful
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0052811_0053586	so the tpa will have some recognition which would recognize the users' voice and already it would change its function
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0124113_0125076	and we have decided before we have seen some things like instead of buttons we have some clothes
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0113892_0114015	umbrella
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0162607_0162897	what kind of energy do we for you
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0075476_0075617	have to come back to that later
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0077830_0078010	the next one sorry
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0027908_0028452	are we all in agreement that that's about what we discuss last time
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0116197_0116303	thank you
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0072494_0072892	what i'm no question it's bad
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0139591_0140222	so i've really been looking at the press and the ads that are out there for other remote controls
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0155631_0155945	so speech recognition is most important as far as i'm concerned
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0083549_0083753	so it could be strong
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0028468_0028599	now i've gotten pretty much of it
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0128993_0129358	yeah the protocol can be delivered in two different cases
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0133922_0134042	so for me now thank you
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0024093_0024326	and maybe have an alarm clock
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0088348_0088688	suppose if it's thirty eight degrees outside
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0159844_0160229	and then you're expecting an answer from for example you have a visa
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0023009_0023561	but it's maybe small children that they couldn't watch a child that is under disability
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0099792_0100604	and it will send some children through the window and then the child will sense that connection and knows that witchbook is present
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0044193_0044767	then there should be some buttons which can control functions like the color
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0146840_0147354	and we should develop one or two two features we can really do on in our ad campaign
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0143016_0143144	slipper is beautiful
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0060335_0061014	yeah no this is an interface for a chair for a remote which a child can use
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0134648_0135275	yeah on the scroll and the push button can you can achieve rolling by repeated pushing a button
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0169694_0169928	her speech and education teacher would be a problem
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0051039_0051517	which can be recognized by as voice recognition in the database
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0150324_0150982	they're more back into soft feelings things with maybe a little cloud on them
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0004927_0005625	first we going over the minutes of the last meeting more or less
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0061664_0062022	and this comes with different colors different shapes
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0148872_0149481	and i've been looking around at what designs every year different things are popular
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0143839_0144355	and they want as few butts as possible and they don't care for the mothing
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0149481_0149939	and in my research this year i found out that fruit and vegetable shapes are really popular
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0046472_0047301	subsequently if if a university he gets a telephone and if he wants he doesn't want to switch off the tv
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0018493_0018818	you could see the time you know what true they wanna watch
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0120132_0120531	the the those prince will ask as wizards and scoues
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0138383_0138486	okay
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0013079_0013750	it should have a very short learning curve
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0064779_0065694	well this is a big obvious to me because it's important to me
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0034196_0034711	how the movie looks like so that it is spectacular to customers
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0078760_0078872	the cones decide
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0114274_0114940	you can also see the the two two green things are there sisters
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0168519_0168635	and
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0023683_0024093	her personal favorite was it should be taped
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0131805_0132583	and also for elixirs we can use a simple and regular or an advanced chip on the prince
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0130408_0130522	you have more pictures
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0101397_0101770	it proves a more more cold blood system than that button
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0119842_0120132	it's just printing something on a board
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0031419_0031552	come close
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0138188_0138348	you're right to my first my next slide
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0104690_0105088	now that situation that monco has to be applied by the transfer
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0055573_0056263	then these are some of the reminders which are different in shape and color but they have many buttons
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0108100_0108406	so this is how the remote control works
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0025022_0025699	the different systems that exist are infrastructure or railway
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0041040_0041593	then you should have a button which can be used for increasing or decreasing the volume
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0063815_0064076	tractile child interface
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0110176_0110781	and if you open the window curtain you have this scuba scuba boat and five electric scooters
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0087957_0088348	and it should be resistant to high as well as low temperatures
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0097215_0097446	can you go to the next slide please
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0174301_0175288	in this case the two of you firstnamy and firstnamef have to work together on a project using building clay it says here
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0029733_0029926	okay i can start first yeah
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0141886_0142148	and i wouldn't encourage you all to do the same
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0118489_0119311	it's it's better to go for printing because you can build these kind of sophisticated books on a book and it's just printing
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0123998_0124113	it's please
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0094162_0095016	if we will be able to make a rearchival biography then we we need not go for a high profile
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0067389_0067648	it's this is one section in the book which can be created
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0010556_0011343	in addition to that to make it sell of course the marketing manager wishes that it's be very attractive
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0152485_0153203	and what we really have to decide in this meeting is the concept of the remote
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0155218_0155361	okay
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0059519_0059766	and this has built a bridge
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0140222_0140793	and i i spent a lot of time on the internet surfing doing the same thing
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0071148_0071367	oh okay thank you very much
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0093019_0093692	there's all this technical electronic computer
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0047301_0048236	but he he can reduce the sound he can bring the volleyball down and he can watch the tv
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0165119_0165290	umbrella design and compact
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0083753_0084199	and there are no human medicines used in that
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0017055_0017265	if two many buttons are pressed
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0134248_0134577	any particular concerns by anybody
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0082452_0082974	it can be a plastic one hard plastic so that it can be strong
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0109916_0110176	and we had a few buttons and all
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0164816_0165230	umbrella umbrella twenty twenty decide and strong
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0104247_0104633	that's more school has been integrated by the integrated school
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0072037_0072494	well looks like we still have quite a choice of things out there
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0149939_0150324	and people are tired of hard plastic and hard metal
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0018818_0019144	overall meaning was maybe different chapters
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0051517_0052189	well if you want to see the nineteenth anniversary
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0056861_0057360	so you can decide an interface which is very simple and which is easy to use
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0057360_0057596	even a kid can use that
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0145782_0146250	or's hasta be look really great and it has to come out before the others
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0168945_0169070	well i think so
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0128530_0128654	oh that's interesting
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0098714_0098982	oh when you press a button when you do that
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0102181_0103151	suppose the user has pressed button button one then it will have a the cycle will continue
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0064655_0064779	next week please
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0058505_0059282	and this has mighty muscles it can be used for velocity it can be used for velocity
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0113411_0114156	yeah you can see the tv one eight three five battle
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0088688_0089579	it should be able to resist the temperature high and high temperatures and low temperatures
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0085230_0085823	blue ribbon green so we hafta use some coloring colors
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0159121_0159844	yeah it's it's yeah it's like you're recording a all a question already
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0086444_0087057	we can use a highly sophisticated one because it's the heart of the motor
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0021374_0021488	in to save him
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0042459_0043076	excuse me if you're watching a friend program and you would like to have a subscription
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0168722_0168921	am not sure what they mean by substance
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0160229_0160992	and i'm the usage and my family members are the users i will always correct of a question
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0175288_0175809	you will receive a special instructions to be sent to you by your coaches
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0037796_0037911	nine channels
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0013868_0014315	and maybe it could be solved by using a ladder
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0116861_0117506	actually building a soccer ball is pretty pretty easy and it's a expense
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0041810_0042459	then there should be a button which can give subtitles for a particular program which is going on at development
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0061014_0061664	oh this is unusual friendly it's very attractive and children can use it as well as they can play with it
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0154519_0154897	you wanna try come back to your room and live there
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0173847_0174301	and the marketing expert with the project evaluation
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0131214_0131805	we can have a medical such as plastic surgery but we can't use
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0119311_0119607	you don't needta use visas and all that
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0032145_0032361	and that's number two right
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0151820_0152029	that
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0101828_0102181	everything everything it's one more school
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0048236_0048884	now the most important feature i would like to have in my room would be the speech recognition feature
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0057596_0057810	so can you go on to the next stage
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0022213_0022856	of course she would have an umbrella and also has meaning an interesting feature that it could have have maybe a window
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0156682_0157287	yeah but but i'm very very much detail how how far it will work
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0065748_0066286	yeah i could lose that in a minute
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0071367_0071681	many concerns on her presentation
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0092199_0092360	can you go on to the next slide please
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0168978_0169657	slipper events like different types of feet's buttons yeah can have a metal button or a silver slipper
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0137498_0138269	we don't have a lot of time left and we will still have to make a decision on the marketing expert has to present her her thing
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0107871_0108100	then it will do the appropriate action
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0130522_0130739	we have five minutes to the end of the meeting
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0163363_0163659	that that's that's gonna be most cost effective and the best thing
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0006997_0007904	from everyone to see how she best could market this this this product at the within the budget that was given
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0164914_0165021	and it's strong
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0055337_0055442	but please next time
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0110781_0111206	you can see a chip there which is having eighteen minutes
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0160992_0161438	good morning around eight o'clock i wanna see the news in the television
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0120979_0121709	and also you can see there's a exercise for buttons like when you press a button
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0009457_0009814	so we should dress that
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0030545_0030674	my speech
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0155994_0156254	one one feature which could be a one feature
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0076735_0076947	oh who wants to go next
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0109602_0109775	and two the next slide please
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0125076_0126004	but but a push button releases a simple trip which is a hurry rise
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0084523_0085230	and yeah and all of a sudden using coloring colors colors like if we want to have different colors
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0166028_0166645	use the internet to check information
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0015303_0016034	that has an infrastructure that connects the city
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0161438_0161756	so i'd say it's good morning and the tea will be witch on
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0167951_0168227	but i guess for yeah
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0154766_0155184	yes i would like to include this feature which is called his voice recognition
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0169802_0169923	write write
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0163060_0163175	but i think better
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0049852_0050709	so reminders can be can be designed which can have the voice recognizes you can recall your own voice
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0106205_0106914	the sentence in the tv can see the individual it reacts against
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0170012_0170726	okay so why do we put down speech and education if possible producing some more research from our understanding and how expertise that is
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0074006_0074814	you know i don't think that's gonna be be our ultimate at the check out counter
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0014486_0015156	our technical manager has then said that he feels he should have a trip
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0122749_0122929	in integrated
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0081013_0081722	one i have just brief down few few minutes which we realize for the remote control construction
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0081722_0082429	the first one is case to keep all the company's like
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0114940_0115695	and just beside that you can see a trunk and a cinderella ship that one is a carriage
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0156529_0156793	yeah that that may be really good yeah i agree with that
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0029094_0029975	and i don't know whether the order matches much okay
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0046272_0046472	there should be a mute button
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0008138_0008820	in general the idea is that it should be something that it's not difficult to use
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0097446_0097754	and how it works how the
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0115695_0116236	and also there's a dog
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0023561_0023683	it would be compact
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0037392_0037633	one two three four five six
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0157714_0157817	desert probably
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0044767_0045303	color of the picture the contrast sharpness brightness of the picture
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0169264_0169694	yeah or or like her speech would also be a problem
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0092605_0093019	and a dog a dog barks at him
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0011343_0011676	oh she says put some cinderella in one way or another
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0028659_0029094	okay then we i'm looking for three possibilities
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0158875_0159324	so to get a good recognition recognizing something it's a
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0130672_0131029	yeah maybe i have just one more slice i think
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0117850_0118489	because when you're building some structures and all so wires
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0119607_0119842	it's not exactly wise we are using
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0130283_0130408	okay yeah
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0108608_0108739	can you go to the next place
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0012321_0013004	that's a very important fact because if they say well i go home and think about it that won't work
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0073178_0074006	the tpa is good the two big to miss place i think it's just funny
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0089579_0090048	and it should be with equipment with timer and alarm facility
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0025804_0026480	maybe it could have a executive executive saving a figure
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0120671_0120979	so that green thing is a aquatic
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0133716_0133830	yeah that's it
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0100604_0101397	suppose you have pressed a jam one but number one you have pressed then the chip will know that the number one button was pressed
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0037995_0038100	knives
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0140793_0141346	and then when i'm out in people's houses or at meetings or anything like that
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0127968_0128534	so that's all so we can have in a bakery or we can use solar systems
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0096832_0097215	and we we have a soccer ball in a remote location
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0148032_0148872	so we've got to nowow our collection down to two things i think that we're gonna say are really great about our our new project
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0095016_0095434	even if it's a low formal dress it it it can't it it don't charge much
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0135352_0135967	well the the the scrolling was a different you can go for switches like buttons
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0169701_0169802	but they're regular mice
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0153362_0154015	and so what do you think on the subject
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0056263_0056861	so sometimes the useta find it very difficult to recognize which button is for what function and all that
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0095628_0096094	then all of a sudden we can use it for a long time
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0135967_0136326	which which we useta do before ten years before i think
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0176912_0177406	where are they hiding
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0052189_0052811	the the the the yeah the the the the yeah the the the the yeah
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0122929_0123067	can you go to the next slipper
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0137172_0137325	yeah yeah
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0072892_0073178	but we're gonna hafta narrow it down a little more
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0080715_0080945	can you go onto the next slice please
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0040287_0040407	good
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0141346_0141886	and i try to notice what kind of environment i'm in the conversation i ask about
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0166960_0167250	that would be your area i think right yeah
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0144923_0145145	go ahead i'm trying to finish fast for you
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0171259_0171654	our next meeting will be in thirty minutes
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0161998_0162607	okay before we get too far off here the consequences of the accident
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0144355_0144558	they want each button to do something
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0074936_0075179	oh i think these are her possessions
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0158196_0158744	maybe different people will be having different things so
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0157287_0157809	because speech it it it it's own problem issues
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0077090_0077226	okay and you
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0040685_0040793	next slide please
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0142685_0143016	people like something that really fits in their hand
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0127306_0127968	kind of proposal of engineering modern watches that you see probably to prove engineering
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0132975_0133592	yeah and for the most part we just develop a schedule and stuff like that
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0037914_0038091	yes nine numbers
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0112409_0113165	the all of the electronic components have all those things like chip and diode transistors
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0074040_0074256	okay
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0008975_0009457	it's almost one time that people lose a lot
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0132583_0132975	all of a sudden it includes the umbrella cinderella
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0098982_0099792	you complete a percentage that means when you press a button that will be a a small suit under the button
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0157856_0158196	yeah it's not distinct problem but it's recognizing a person's voice
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0163699_0163926	okay then check on the prince
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0011777_0012321	so that the people are buying it now because in particular with small numbers
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0054117_0054527	so this is one of the infrastructure which can be created
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0030610_0030733	oh get you slice
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0151717_0151820	okay
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0123124_0123528	so these are the scutes on underneath the body
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0054720_0055229	very simple interface which has all the important features
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0085884_0086444	and the second important thing he's injured
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0103151_0103896	and the transaction will apply the situation and send them to the e d a which translates to english into english
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0156276_0156529	yeah that could be our star feature
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0164267_0164756	and i think we all agree on the case we wanna have something maybe bright colorful
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0004479_0004718	how how we doing
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0020468_0020854	for the item
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0142148_0142685	and my findings from this is that you know small is beautiful
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0095434_0095628	it it's not a high workplace
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0010196_0010416	that is very simple to use
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0030733_0030920	oh okay
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0172871_0173724	and the u i d is sposta come up with a use of insurance
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0138641_0139591	alright my method is i'm interested in what the composition is doing and wanna see how we can make ourselves different from the composition
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0150982_0151470	so those are the things maybe we wanna look at as far as sailability of the item
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0126666_0127306	and as an engineer we we offer a basic basic
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0093692_0094109	but i would like to just one thing if we
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0087057_0087957	if it is going to be a happily occasion so it you should we should have a happily sophisticated one
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0137109_0137442	we'll just go for push buttons for in the interest of course
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0074814_0075047	it's gonna be a little bit too unwee
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0145145_0145782	and our professor is as far as i'm concerned we gotta get to the market before the competition
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0106914_0107871	that when it sees the ambulance no which what what what action it has to do
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0123528_0123781	can you see the brown mugs
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0045677_0045873	now there should be a memory switch
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0161756_0162029	it would recognize my voice and it'll switch on
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0066729_0067250	so this is a umbrella you know it's important to miss place or lose
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0147354_0148032	if we try to tell people it has too many great features the consumer just gets confused and we don't get anywhere
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0053586_0053930	so this is one of the very important feature that remote control can have
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0108950_0109602	when you look at the remote control it's it's it's it's a normal normal remote control
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0152200_0152485	conclude the presentation of everyone
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0105088_0105449	that is the use of tricycle which we use in the remote control
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0126004_0126666	they for schools we hafta go for a sufficient and and a full comprehensive program
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0066114_0066729	but this is a very big place
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0108818_0108950	yeah i have two pictures
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0060165_0060335	can you go to the next slide
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0024326_0024794	and the miracle would possibly be no of nonalcoholic nature
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0116663_0116861	the green one is a soccer ball
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0009814_0010097	and of course it should be something
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0105449_0106205	it will apply the circle and it will send it to the e i and it will transfer the signal into an infrastructure project
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0164048_0164176	okay
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0167428_0167885	witches like we use buttons for you see
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0144558_0144676	and i catching is important
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0136783_0137172	so i think it's better we go for ordinary
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0165087_0165205	umbrella umbrella yeah
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0129358_0130124	usually the case is umbrella that we see usually not normal remote control
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0116498_0116663	so this is the second book
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0084199_0084349	and it should be reasonable
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0074229_0074411	yeah i i i think
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0076254_0076643	oh no i think her presentation was good and she really explained all the options
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0078010_0078122	it's it was the umbrella
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0117506_0117850	it's it costs less than what you print on a paper
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0033756_0034196	well as an engineer i would give more information on the infrastructure
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0158654_0158929	well you you teach you have to teach
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0049045_0049572	it's an integrated program for people with disabilities
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0043076_0043969	then there should be a challenge which can trigger this mechanism in the television so that the users can see the the the subtitles on the screen
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0057900_0058505	yeah so this is one of the records which has this voice voice recognition
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0147480_0147945	what what would you one being good and seven being the worst
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0011091_0012013	should be child friendly design with two children maybe with star shape or other shape
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0103051_0103417	twelve seven point six whatever that means
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0005591_0006464	it was discussed in the last meeting which was open by the presentation from the internet
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0131014_0131379	so think that basically we've got a great project and we can get off and running with it
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0029697_0030149	so we prefer to have one or two friends that can be really driven home
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0166342_0167206	so i think they're quite big so i mean we can just have small buttons and more buttons in that case
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0178437_0178646	yeah yeah definitely
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0180745_0180864	yes we could
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0183540_0183677	yeah many
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0169598_0170293	and then maybe we can do something with the
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0179899_0180315	we used whiteboard we didn't use digital pens or these things
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0054300_0054709	we've all of a sudden included a button which is the wrapping button
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0131419_0131783	one i just realize one thing
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0168775_0169598	so that that's where we're gonna have two meetings one of the meetings instead of having two meetings
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0044970_0045542	we decided on including certain features and art work
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0093918_0094226	elocational simple chip on the prince
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0141656_0141844	and i think that was my last
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0144961_0145310	okay
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0084556_0084761	sposta make a little presentation on there
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0098501_0098936	oh i think that it's for for rabies there's a case you know
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0120514_0120928	went to the shape to be bay marfish i didn't want anything with animals and all square
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0064511_0065246	the buttons are all raised and if you hold it in the center of your hand you can even reach it over here so you don't hafta turn it around
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0162068_0162501	and anybody else have any other comments or any things that we feel we should evaluate
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0084864_0085297	oh no this was our evaluation criteria which we just have done
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0178402_0178668	yes yes you've done a good job
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0057045_0057353	it'd take the useta the previous and the next chapter so this is
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0180636_0180757	yeah probably
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0146395_0146789	okay so on shape
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0141654_0141780	yes it is
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0158088_0158204	oh give it a three
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0165682_0166106	yeah included some more buttons and yeah feet
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0144286_0144428	oh thank you
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0094872_0095121	really quick on the prince
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0133730_0134107	and so we've still got four years to go to spend
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0053896_0054005	the music
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0034072_0034535	now we are ready for the presentation of the project
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0148505_0148664	yes i think a shape is one
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0070404_0071261	the the these two two to enroll the program and these two are to enroll the program
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0067786_0068008	the color's very attractive
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0142596_0142934	and i'm sposta present this scale on the white board
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0059316_0059420	just but okay
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0190501_0191179	yeah but we we were told we could end the final meeting at any time you know whenever we felt we were finished yes
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0111535_0112165	now we would like to have a presentation by the marketing experts on production evaluation
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0185896_0186554	today we have apple juice and after we sell a million of them we have champagne
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0065246_0065653	turn it up side down move it up and down i really liked that
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0042426_0042999	yeah because you'll be touching the buttons more so it is soft when you touch it
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0189421_0189660	oh i was getting on here but getting it off
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0183545_0183798	but i think we were very good yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0067081_0067808	yes and it's oh yeah here it's on and yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0014410_0015315	university of maryland presented her thoughts on the issue
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0138250_0138356	yeah yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0077093_0077224	yeah snappy
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0079632_0080257	voice voice recognition is our big selling point because nobody else seems to have that in this price range
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0117552_0118356	we don't want somebody to suddenly come to us and tell us that this button is ticko and you know some child will swallow it and then we won't tell anyone
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0161160_0161279	oh yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0023384_0023891	it should be better operated and of course should have the special cases
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0049751_0050264	we have already included two buttons for increasing or decreasing the volume
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0112217_0112448	okay i'll take my phone down so you can bring it up
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0072255_0072883	well i have one question will there be anything written on the
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0123207_0124124	so apparently the other features and others the look the feel and the shape that's what people are gonna get in the store
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0076855_0077167	for the knee yeah we have the knee shoulder
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0127341_0127967	but i think that it's one to seven
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0183727_0184471	in more than one respect and so i think we did very well here
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0074614_0074775	yeah of course and all that
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0177258_0177401	thank you
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0033325_0033798	and that concludes the presentation from the last meeting
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0178213_0178697	well i think you've done a good job
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0095977_0096116	oh
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0047312_0047703	now we've included another feature that is the mute button
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0110834_0110979	oh
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0152668_0152819	color i gave it a white
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0073384_0074001	yes these buttons will have the numbers and all the rest of the buttons will have symbols will have symbols
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0133554_0133711	eight eight twenty yes
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0030916_0031126	he feels that's really what people want today
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0094226_0094356	is that what we're using
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0078678_0078822	yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0086822_0087076	very sorry
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0042228_0042451	oh that's nice and friendly
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0086184_0086437	when there's a protection over it
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0135522_0136083	as a finish project and saying okay we have a voice recorder that costs so much
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0178586_0179168	and i think term work i think was very very good i think we worked
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0013227_0013457	yes
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0073933_0074457	we'll have symbols so that that the user really knows you know and doesn't have to first learn it
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0122686_0123207	and unfortunately i put last on my list because people aren't gonna use it before they buy it
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0155051_0155410	okay i gave it a three two yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0074001_0074203	yes but can be easily
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0103669_0103947	three four five six seven eight nine
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0191856_0192197	they'd take me to the rest of the time to get my microphone out from my microphone
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0079005_0079329	now what what are the special features for the marketing
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0061773_0061987	now the marketing experts hasta
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0156922_0157788	well it's all so you can't really try it out the other things you have more it's not as much so from that point of view but
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0159432_0159557	well
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0151338_0151479	okay
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0124124_0124344	they don't have a television in the store they can't play with it
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0119781_0120514	okay now the things that i was thinking and the my wish list has really been realized in this prototype
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0121283_0121644	the color's bright and warm which is what we wanted
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0069314_0069519	so you can push one yes
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0188646_0188930	oh what i i have my cord behind you here
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0187669_0188086	beautiful from the production point of view and beautiful for a marketing point of view
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0090085_0090281	so we useta use one
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0170425_0170535	the world's trouble
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0068008_0068633	the these buttons around here are the mouse
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0122239_0122686	even though it's gonna be hard plastic it feels good in your hands so that's nice
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0140907_0141086	so be aware of that
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0035625_0035939	so this is what we have made
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0028058_0029057	to do that maybe one or two feeders could be delivered on the other side of the corner could be built on
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0069159_0069314	one on both sides yes
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0188280_0188412	so thank you
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0158869_0159019	three
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0119064_0119388	we think it's good we're gonna get behind it and sell it
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0154776_0154971	oh i think i'll give it a two
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0043039_0043332	and then for the leg
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0098936_0099082	oh okay then
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0114846_0115717	okay well obviously my method for the marketing of this thing is first to ask the big question will it sell
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0085663_0086259	but in my interactions i think it's that i was sposta go to the board and do something
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0176806_0177143	personally i think i'm pretty happy
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0100797_0101105	because we didn't put the clock in it after all
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0123878_0124032	that's what people are saying
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0118628_0119064	and then after that we just hafta go with our best intuition and you know we like it
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0155919_0156691	and the next is fantastic where i i admitted i was a little hard on our team here but
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0098722_0099264	that's just for the case medical so special color so we having that right
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0052399_0052600	one a one
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0174986_0175438	so the question really is how do we feel with the progress
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0189656_0189882	think we still have some time left
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0182537_0182670	oh i think that's true
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0019599_0019852	and how it works you press the button
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0051690_0052136	now or a multiple all so contains a button which is the mini button
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0126043_0126301	there's really really excellent
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0161362_0161910	but otherwise i think we're ready to go with this project
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0128975_0129552	and given the constraints that we had i think we got it as soft as possible
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0009020_0009435	you would have a memory switch a unit button in case the telephone rings or something
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0085140_0085243	okay okay
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0180322_0180811	now maybe we could use the white board a little bit more yeah we didn't use that enough
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0013485_0014410	but her very personal favorite really she she would very much like to see a speech recognition integrated into this remote
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0080276_0080937	and then the other thing would basically be shape or practice
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0078888_0079032	that would really work
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0083897_0084011	and the boy's reaction
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0012013_0012926	he presents it almost an over size remote which she guarantees nobody will ever be able to lose
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0143817_0144241	so i forgot to that
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0153405_0153617	one one okay
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0170918_0171804	maybe consultation some of the university and and see what we can do with that
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0097826_0097962	would rub
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0147227_0147341	and i gave it one
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0190111_0190291	you know
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0124378_0124658	so they'll be our main selling point
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0108986_0109101	me sure for that
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0152988_0153157	five i like the colors
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0177613_0178216	and then the next question is are we happy with the leader of this project
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0101930_0102129	yes do you do have a special phone
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0136202_0136654	so we just hafta be aware of that
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0114688_0114846	yeah right
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0127967_0128408	and i think we're sort of right in the middle as far as other competitors
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0169338_0169663	yeah definitely yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0134116_0134616	mean monday we have another four point three
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0058041_0058417	the next century in the new mexico party or
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0090983_0091358	the cinderella you're trying to change her protected
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0133822_0134090	we have a lot of years yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0158223_0158340	okay
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0140581_0140742	one and two and three and four
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0179398_0179899	and i think we are we happy with the money we used
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0063112_0063579	what what i really like a lot about it is that you can reach the whole thing with one thumb
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0093443_0093918	can you imagine so that's in the energy sources that's all we need
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0035939_0036376	there's a multiple of the multiple which we are going to build
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0061477_0061773	so this is a problem
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0077167_0077358	he goes right back into his cell
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0097444_0097645	plastic we said right
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0086604_0086809	but that's after the finishing oh okay
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0146050_0146395	so now we're all sposta say what we think
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0145937_0146050	alright
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0092731_0092979	oh yeah okay let's see
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0053724_0053828	oh
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0069986_0070147	yes yes
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0098878_0098991	you're for the
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0049439_0049590	oh
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0031293_0032097	the decision that we took last time was that the special feature we would like to see is a speech recovery
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0068759_0069052	and the fun but it's you know
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0108661_0108807	and i just tried that
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0054854_0055307	now this is a special special feature which we have included
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0188476_0188646	okay thank you
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0167206_0167460	if we want to have more features and that
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0152819_0153059	and i really like all those nice bright warm colors
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0116800_0117268	we can't except every session of course but maybe we just needta get a few
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0091530_0091813	he told me i could just change it here and then it would
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0163765_0164417	here's what we're looking at satisfaction of on for example room for creativity
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0066948_0067118	that's that's a really good thing
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0065653_0066194	you really did a good job on that my little daughters
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0185498_0185849	it's been a few years you know
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0107999_0108108	uhhuh
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0030288_0030916	it could have a foot and vegetable decide and should have a soft feel
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0019263_0019471	and of course the soccer ball
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0071408_0071569	scroll up i'm scroll down the page
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0152596_0152725	color i'm
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0095286_0095859	that's all we need the one case uncooked flat single curved
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0186776_0187153	and i think this was very good and
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0152066_0152323	and then how about how we doing on color
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0058428_0059316	swimming as if if you're watching the second channel and then you go to the tenth channel and if you want to go back to the second channel you can wrap it
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0100368_0100500	scroll wheel no
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0056591_0056916	if it is turned to the right it would take to the next chapter
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0149676_0149785	five on the side
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0185374_0185896	slipper
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0059376_0059485	okay yes okay
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0094238_0094352	yeah what are you doing yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0017284_0018010	he would like to see a timer and or alarm facility investigate it
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0085297_0085576	now we're gonna take about fineancing
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0190479_0190598	oh yeah we have time to
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0118356_0118628	so we hafta get some input from those people
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0048112_0048363	and the side of the mother
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0110431_0110834	you're gonna be popular
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0155570_0155756	maybe two yes
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0041445_0042426	the medicine is plastic and for the buttons it is soft rubber and all that good yeah yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0096533_0096673	oh i guess it's terrible
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0094685_0094872	okay one
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0184947_0185232	it's a problem i don't know
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0067684_0067788	yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0074976_0075613	but anyway it it hasta have some kind of of symbols or something like that people
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0104663_0104891	okay yes
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0182303_0183135	yes i think so i think absolutely and fortunately we all had life insurance which made it a little easier
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0185367_0185861	then celebration
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0048363_0048767	then we have included one two nine buttons
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0048890_0049190	for controlling the programs the different channels
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0171906_0172054	oh maybe you're nice
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0076128_0076730	and one more feature is we we have a holder for this remote which is an officer ship
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0077042_0077318	so he goes right back yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0132429_0133181	and i don't know how we can evaluate that or how we can exclude that too
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0148683_0149060	okay and one okay
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0150516_0150699	oh i think i would give it at least a two
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0139103_0139488	as we've seen with so many of these kind of problems
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0105236_0105427	so we looks like we are
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0102276_0102552	and especially magnificent umbrella yes
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0149756_0149886	you you got it four
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0003938_0004133	well hi every one again
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0075924_0076155	okay yeah just when to make sure of that
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0092477_0092677	can you just feel it in the yellow boxes
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0062120_0062796	give her suggestion whether it would be suitable or it would be gone effective
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0067220_0067346	yeah that's great
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0099509_0099901	and then we have the infrastructure
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0006564_0006687	does i know
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0059919_0060901	and at the end it this remote has insurance which will recognize the users' voice and then it'll act according
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0185590_0185884	oh
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0104683_0104824	that's
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0094559_0094685	come on
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0065317_0065522	or have two hands to open it yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0081579_0082128	we hafta draw on on the patient
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0022804_0023264	the scroll is more expensive and not that practical anymore
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0089637_0089762	okay now
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0016564_0017116	should have an introduction section that's highly sophisticated and technical research
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0138351_0139103	and it may not be the greatest quality but it may sell anyway yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0165536_0165724	we can always improve yes
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0159803_0160156	it looks like we got ourselves a pretty good project
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0034881_0035112	just the look at the button pot i'll explain
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0084011_0084185	and they're gonna be our two selling points
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0183135_0183441	did we find new ideas
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0119388_0119535	next time please
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0069570_0069806	so if you left ten or right hand it doesn't matter you know
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0029213_0029697	two many new features or too many points would be confused matter
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0068745_0069236	one of these the front buttons which yeah the metal buttons on both sides
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0141086_0141328	you want to go to next week's movie
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0046331_0046436	hmhm
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0141252_0141534	well i is in this my last life
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0142934_0143589	and we're sposta talk about those things as a team now so if you put my last slide back up there
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0052836_0053649	we have included a button which is florian green color and this is the mini button which we will include in the collection
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0109683_0109836	okay fine
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0153617_0153839	how about the file
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0140779_0140907	okay
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0044413_0044878	and and the button button's part will be explained by firstnamef
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0097223_0097444	case study
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0071387_0071489	oh it's very good
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0022216_0022696	one this whole thing should be puddles with a simple chip
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0150247_0150389	oh i don't know
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0180493_0180786	yes yes yes
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0117268_0117552	and show the the procedure to become a surgeon
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0128456_0128620	and our color i think it's great
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0154126_0154680	taking into consideration texture and comfortable in the hand
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0168404_0168517	yeah definitely
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0072883_0073380	that people know or they hafta learn that from a piece of paper which button it's what
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0038429_0039128	and it it will be easily fit into the hands and you can access all the buttons easily
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0131783_0132180	in the final scene there was no room for our voice to recover
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0106093_0106272	yes i should save this i suppose
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0103915_0104042	maybe you did just
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0125417_0126043	okay so the shape i think is a one
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0130090_0131014	obviously we could have adifferent functions but then we'd discover something else so i would say that we got to a five out of seven on the university
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0098268_0098462	but yes but
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0144660_0144894	because i can't remember what i put on there
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0062821_0062982	okay well
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0071589_0071843	looks like something i can sell
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0046564_0046958	now we have included the switch on and off but
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0170535_0170789	maybe we can put that all on one button
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0046289_0046397	oh okay
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0088686_0089440	okay english course we say that's battery right
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0114272_0114502	okay well you move just to the next slide right away
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0165869_0165978	yes february
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0087996_0088686	okay now on the finishing we bring up the
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0171858_0172740	oh oh always bearing in mind that right now we're of course well within the budget and that we still you know we probably can't
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0071210_0071387	okay okay
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0064279_0064480	yes the buttons are all raised right
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0050738_0051294	and we have oh so included two buttons for crawling up and crawling down the branch
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0129552_0130090	and then furniture i think you did a really good job on furniture
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0082128_0082331	you're really gonna have the best the
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0148666_0148936	yeah even yeah she's one
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0110140_0110431	okay good so that's the good news
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0184719_0184848	are the costs within budget
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0042922_0043023	thank you
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0026431_0026654	easy to use and it would be i catching
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0096704_0096864	the dog's barking
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0145310_0145611	sposta see how long my lease is here
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0063579_0064261	that you don't need two hands and it's easily reachable even for somebody with a small hand yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0141540_0141654	oh i don't know
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0093328_0093443	oh go away
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0148244_0148497	one okay and byebye
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0080981_0081579	yeah well i think that everybody's gonna say they're remote control is perfect
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0128620_0128975	the colors are bright and warm and we really did a great job there
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0178981_0179274	yeah i i did two i think we worked well together as a team yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0124658_0125417	so those have been fulfilled by your project and go ahead to the next line please
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0140240_0140346	umbrella
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0074373_0074971	because we need the systems because we're going into an international market we can't have anything that's language dependent
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0177170_0177576	and i'm pretty happy with the two and something i think i can mark it
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0103508_0103763	oh i think that's the problem
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0100500_0100770	in order to go we'll see this play
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0078699_0078921	oh yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0082708_0083555	so i think we hafta play with the engine play with the vehicle and then the voice recognition
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0114600_0114759	you want to go the next night
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0032218_0033189	the energy could be on a chip should be trendy design and strong and should have buttons
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0087539_0087996	okay we had looks and voice recognition
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0084293_0084575	okay now having said that
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0172740_0173341	with this particular idea we probably can't just at a whole lot of more things
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0066194_0066948	and i like the idea that the onoff button is in a really prominent place
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0082445_0082708	cut it remote control on the block
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0185232_0185367	yes
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0079329_0079718	that's really the boy's reaction that's really unusual
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0149863_0150178	yeah i feel it's just average
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0108969_0109144	my head is yes
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0013037_0013522	and she was challenged on that point
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0133143_0133582	well we had what eight eight years twenty as our cost
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0108807_0108969	my doctor's computer
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0097975_0098164	because we're gonna have the soft buns
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0164981_0165391	is there more room for creativity or are we absolutely happy
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0149060_0149273	and how about on saturday
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0069948_0070393	there's brings the money up on the scene and the orange ones are
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0034773_0034881	yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0137150_0137939	well as we know and today's technical technical world you can do just about anything at any price
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0104079_0104235	eight eight point two
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0174552_0174661	oh
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0111164_0111424	so that's i think fineancing was pretty simple
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0083555_0083713	and i think those are the two things to push
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0103665_0103782	that's the price
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0182205_0182421	and we use the slide because it was better position
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0101319_0101533	peanut butter and jelly special color
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0039502_0040024	you useta have all the buttons
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0039300_0039665	yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0072104_0072410	okay now i'm sposta have one question yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0151479_0152066	okay okay here the decision of course you wanna give it one
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0155687_0155789	two okay
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0075541_0076079	next that we can have on the cake it will be pretty on the cake
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0145622_0145736	you can make it
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0092979_0093328	okay one okay
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0121644_0122239	we wanted the feel to be as soft as possible will have the softness and the way this is shaped
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0137939_0138351	so we're just gonna have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0120928_0121283	and i wanted to be comfy and cozy so we've we've got that
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0010653_0010780	oh
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0043332_0044239	for the light emitting device it's a bulb like an ordinary incandescent bulb and it's it's a bulb
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0186464_0186776	so i i thank you all very much
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0190292_0190402	they're they're wonderful
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0151175_0151364	yeah you and i think it is one
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0069703_0069948	and this brings the new up on the scene
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0013217_0013332	that's right
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0137920_0138077	yeah just go there
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0187272_0187669	we did come up with a new project that's feasible
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0038147_0038429	and all of a sudden compact in shape
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0138186_0138315	yeah but yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0147945_0148244	what do you think the ship is
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0136654_0137085	and and no whether the four thousand will really cover that
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0134767_0135522	but i mean we have one way of presenting that to management as a finished
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0134602_0134830	well that's it
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0027036_0027745	from her point of view of course one of the most important facts is that we could get to market before our competition does
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0166106_0166342	we can make the buttons few buttons small
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0023811_0024629	we've got the marketing expertise for the company and use a friendly look
AMI_TS3003a_H01_MTD011UID_0096589_0096752	okay
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0026316_0027089	is the three faces we're going through
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0124053_0124159	well it was on but
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0055437_0055560	oh what was it
AMI_TS3003a_H02_MTD0010ID_0143150_0143256	they were all mentioned so
AMI_TS3003a_H01_MTD011UID_0097650_0097761	okay yeah
AMI_TS3003a_H01_MTD011UID_0147421_0147542	okay
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0002125_0002332	yeah
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0111506_0112430	as you can see we for a remote control setting price is twenty five dollars
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0039305_0039673	but then first you have to select the pen function
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0135420_0135720	but i don't know if it will exit the production costs
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0112430_0112648	or setting price
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0036390_0036563	one a piece of bread
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0137424_0137534	think it's be short proof
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0121790_0121955	yeah
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0028819_0029177	but i think you know it already by yourself
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0104855_0105283	is a jacket or did you find him in the street or
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0134250_0134482	so we we want different functions
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0002332_0002629	so
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0047793_0048367	and just some up a few of its favorite characteristics
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0021934_0022335	okay what are you going to do
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0072964_0073228	the the
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0033524_0034263	we're going to work with a lot of high tech tools here so it's it's handy if we have a little bit of training first
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0045592_0046119	so as you can see we're going to draw a animal
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0018423_0018701	have you seen any flowers in it
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0001673_0001955	see you all find your places
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0016134_0016442	maybe you could take the minutes once in awhile
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0128777_0129653	and you can program i think eight different disciplines in it and you can use it for education and everything else
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0145518_0145955	and we can all work on our own progress
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0032189_0032473	so that's a bit what you're going through
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0115933_0116883	so that's also a point we hafta keep in mind that we won't make remote controls with small television inside and stuff like that
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0033218_0033524	then we've got our first total training
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0061241_0061469	he's gone no
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0047133_0047351	everybody saying everybody playing with the mouse
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0037867_0038005	spend
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0085882_0086049	it's go really slow when you're riding
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0062718_0063066	okay
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0066182_0066320	maybe you just
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0035682_0035790	so you can say
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0109896_0110175	okay
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0087944_0088144	they're beautiful animals animals
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0145174_0145405	finish meeting now
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0131716_0131893	so that's a pretty handy
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0034870_0035579	in the white board here there's a little tube on this side
AMI_TS3003a_H01_MTD011UID_0128504_0128622	oh yeah
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0121006_0121414	so just on a side note why is my laptop only giving me a black screen
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0071194_0071407	go ahead
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0025776_0025899	it's
AMI_TS3003a_H01_MTD011UID_0138219_0138494	you know what i i mean
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0010687_0010968	it's being motivated by the environment
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0143328_0143680	and questions about this presentation
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0136138_0136478	but that would be really good if we could do that
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0122107_0122208	does it do anything
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0009014_0009424	so there's a problem with the
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0045264_0045479	and then we're going to try out the wife
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0081822_0081983	it's nice
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0145405_0145518	okay
AMI_TS3003a_H02_MTD0010ID_0103983_0104246	mine is a bit more
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0040965_0041081	then
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0050930_0051366	another thing is you hafta be a bit slow
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0140877_0141040	that's better
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0112946_0113775	that's the least we hafta get from our remote controls so we hafta work together to reach our arms
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0074356_0074838	maybe it's easier to draw with the smaller line with i think
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0037144_0037423	keep you we don't do this to do anything with
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0116883_0117060	umbrella umbrella
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0120140_0120442	it's easier
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0123799_0123948	yes put it back yeah
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0049213_0049607	there's i can start from now
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0026037_0026206	that's about the new remote control
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0072463_0072613	and i'm gonna draw him back
AMI_TS3003a_H02_MTD0010ID_0058364_0058516	oh
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0108818_0109508	so if you have any ideas or if you wanna draw anything on the white board just ask
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0046785_0046932	well it's running away
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0029177_0030124	the individual decision is going to work on the working design and a bit of the look and feel design
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0082994_0083320	little blue dot they always get spade on their buds
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0036897_0037144	select a pen ruler
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0108374_0108495	that's pretty clear
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0041240_0041513	short thing about documentaries
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0003809_0004274	don't know if if everybody knows me so
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0035790_0036251	you know these functions we don't do anything to do with only
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0052990_0053502	but i think seven they'll be nice
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0136591_0136893	and other functions for remote control
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0059063_0059197	and i can and do
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0057762_0057892	oh i'm thinking about a short film
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0047534_0047721	they're going to drive an ambulance
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0108495_0108818	so everybody knows how the work with the whiteboard now
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0132568_0133401	if you can put different kind of devices in one remote control it makes it a lot easier as well
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0142216_0142437	but maybe just a little lead i don't know
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0019753_0020054	it doesn't work here
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0041935_0042279	forjogging i think
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0049787_0050177	you can use this pen by holding it like a little child
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0007797_0008416	there's also some microphones there but you don't hafta pay a lot of attention on those
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0053502_0053863	now you'll see my drawing capabilities
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0011666_0012227	well i don't know if you noticed but we're working for real reaction
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0024629_0025214	and the entire disaster that's all so usual friendly and a little bit ridiculous
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0014966_0015902	maybe i can sit down then i can take some notes or let's see
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0010947_0011353	that's interesting
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0037423_0037867	then we've got our pen
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0108160_0108374	okay
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0008416_0009014	because it'll discover when you don't intend do it
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0097550_0097667	umbrella
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0016442_0017136	don't know it's not the other word but just if you hear something you can write it down and just write it down
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0137840_0138045	my remote control ten to fall off
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0027089_0027568	first it's functionalize the disease in in figure one
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0120698_0121118	okay that's good timing
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0059354_0059576	but this easily
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0130868_0131716	so that's pretty handy when you have a feeder or device play it downstairs and you've got it link to your tv on the second floor
AMI_TS3003a_H02_MTD0010ID_0101447_0101812	just try something else
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0122342_0122553	maybe he's just slip it down
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0141432_0141994	but they're all so really drag up the production costs so i'll hafta see about that too
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0110175_0110677	umbrella umbrella
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0069157_0069319	it lives for the fun
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0022335_0022735	or as you can see a new road is as far as you can see a new road
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0009424_0009919	there's some notes in it already i see some documentation
AMI_TS3003a_H01_MTD011UID_0088960_0089086	okay
AMI_TS3003a_H01_MTD011UID_0089086_0089595	oh i'm just gonna drive it head but
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0144935_0145048	and then he can all work
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0063989_0064107	maybe he has to hold it a bit
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0123396_0123568	and the slipper
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0134676_0135420	and we can maybe see if we can do something with infrastructure
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0041513_0041935	we've got our share of
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0022735_0023113	it hasta be original trendy and use a friendly
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0058204_0058330	yeah i
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0074838_0075126	because this is going a little better than i did
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0018701_0018949	think i found one
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0059878_0060429	and i've got to write down a few of his characteristics
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0142562_0142726	that's an idea
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0014290_0014771	we have our opening against the company closing
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0133989_0134250	yeah it's nice
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0023113_0023811	so these are the points by we also hired you
AMI_TS3003a_H02_MTD0010ID_0104256_0104553	but
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0030124_0031102	the university is going to do the technical engineering design
AMI_TS3003a_H01_MTD011UID_0099306_0099539	use a blanket or
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0005415_0005801	let's start off with the little presentation
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0057113_0057800	oh i was trying to draw a dolphin but i think his nose is to be a little bit but it's close
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0007037_0007797	they'll record our actions and you'll have firefighters and microphones they'll recover your voice
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0123948_0124102	they'll be okay i think
AMI_TS3003a_H02_MTD0010ID_0100934_0101447	well i was gonna drive cat too so
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0126555_0126717	and
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0011206_0011375	that's do it read only
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0133645_0133757	it's good to remember
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0143680_0143793	breaks the window
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0017136_0017525	as you can see it's the opening congratulations
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0130326_0130868	and then you can open it from the third or the second floor
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0138102_0138274	slipper
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0129653_0130326	and it also operates on infrastructure so you've got a little device inside your room
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0064300_0064408	upside down
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0124381_0124649	yeah it's those left and right
AMI_TS3003a_H01_MTD011UID_0120696_0120802	five minutes okay
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0132139_0132460	but only
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0028113_0028683	two i had some roll infections on here
AMI_TS3003a_H01_MTD011UID_0129479_0129580	okay
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0004703_0004842	well
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0044097_0044751	it's what i just said it save prince move back or forward one page
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0104111_0104351	yeah it's pretty scary
AMI_TS3003a_H02_MTD0010ID_0105690_0105971	well it's sposta be a cat
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0088144_0088316	and that's just a little meeting
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0139500_0140030	well put the minutes from this meeting in our progress folder
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0088855_0089191	because i passed the pen to her use it instead
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0118948_0119275	so that's leaves is to our little discussion
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0038005_0038928	it's really funny because you can draw with it on this page in the think it is formal
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0006558_0006834	first i'll tell you a little bit about the sitting
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0118393_0118770	and production costs mechanical twelve and a half hours
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0058494_0058654	well
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0046119_0046785	just to get a bit familiar with it
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0005014_0005415	let's see
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0018949_0019052	oh
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0128030_0128442	and i think it's it would be best to just make one remote control that can open them all
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0064408_0065073	and i think that's it because if you're going to do it like this then it will be drive
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0109508_0109679	it's pretty easy
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0099496_0099666	just a blank she said
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0047394_0047534	okay but
AMI_TS3003a_H01_MTD011UID_0130635_0130751	oh yeah
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0117394_0118393	setting price twenty five percent but more important it's the international market where you're trying to focus on
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0004274_0004381	the
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0070477_0071194	so now i'm gonna hand over the pen on the new blank sheet to you
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0114717_0115143	but that's all in the later stage
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0019089_0019267	can i pay much attention to it but
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0032473_0032816	but that's will be all worked out in the other meetings
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0053863_0054193	it's not very much but
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0035579_0035682	here's some friends
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0117060_0117394	so just try to remember these points
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0083669_0084081	for recreation i see
AMI_TS3003a_H02_MTD0010ID_0101812_0102060	one something different then golf field
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0051366_0051895	because if you going to draw it really fast then the pen won't hold up
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0111125_0111506	move along to the progress fine
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0019605_0019753	see if it works this way
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0144376_0144790	okay then i'll put the minutes from this meeting in the paragraph
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0119783_0120140	so i'm gonna sit down and think
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0133775_0133967	so i think you can take minutes again
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0139019_0139500	so these are a few things you can think of
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0042279_0042895	but you all found that already because there were a lot of documentation and it ready so that will be okay
AMI_TS3003a_H02_MTD0010ID_0143042_0143150	oh
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0054362_0054579	see here we hafta do it real slow
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0043941_0044097	here's the simple two word
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0127508_0128030	one for the tv one for the video play
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0025298_0025776	and we've gotten our university degree
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0042895_0043697	and these are available on the smartboards as well so if you have a document you wanna show just to open it from the folder
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0146818_0147455	okay then i'll meet you in about a half an hour i think
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0110677_0110990	so we've got the tool introduction
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0141085_0141213	how much is left in the bakery
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0039673_0040011	but we're going to work with it in a minute
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0040011_0040261	so okay
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0017917_0018314	have you all seen the computer right side right
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0050177_0050801	because if you hold it like this the sentences will get bloomed and then the drawing won't get good
AMI_TS3003a_H01_MTD011UID_0098652_0098803	so
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0047311_0047578	oh i'm gonna
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0135720_0136021	so that's the something we hafta find out i think
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0001955_0002125	there everybody's sitting in the right place
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0021274_0021934	real remote is not really the company we are but just a little
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0126251_0126555	you can use for other
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0003595_0003809	first i'll introduce myself
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0068484_0068929	it's it wants to draw another animal
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0058654_0058775	now we've got another thing
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0063399_0063541	yeah
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0082050_0082163	with of course
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0137040_0137329	maybe you can make it
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0014063_0014177	three this is our age
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0121519_0121952	maybe i've said the magic word
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0065073_0065319	but i don't know just trying
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0126909_0127508	kind of brought tv at home and a dvd player so we got a lot of remote controls
AMI_TS3003a_H02_MTD0010ID_0105971_0106118	cat i like cats because
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0006834_0007037	and you can see the a few kilometers here
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0147455_0147639	so good look
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0063066_0063677	there's a technical and do action i think
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0013476_0013865	and i'm about boat so i'll direct you through the progress
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0120442_0120622	and i've gone to the medicine
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0084307_0084551	maybe you can also write your name somewhere
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0038928_0039305	you can also select the current color and the line with
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0140149_0140381	yeah one other little thing
AMI_TS3003a_H01_MTD011UID_0097240_0097352	and no that's this
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0071435_0071629	okay
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0073228_0073584	okay i'm not much of an artist but here we go
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0044751_0044947	you can switch between the different drawings
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0119275_0119783	if you've got about five or ten minutes left for the conversation
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0070319_0070477	live for the fun
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0012227_0012529	it's a company in australia
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0057962_0058204	so yeah it's it's a bit of the sort of thing
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0083396_0083669	real that shoe
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0104568_0104700	but the most interesting thing
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0036563_0036897	blank new document for each person
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0020054_0020335	okay no problem
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0115233_0115933	our protection costs can be multiple twelve and a half years
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0049607_0049787	well
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0080540_0080833	three this is my
AMI_TS3003a_H01_MTD011UID_0137977_0138110	waterproof or
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0034263_0034870	as you can see we've got the smart boards here and the white board
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0018314_0018423	yeah
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0027568_0027992	after the final decision then the company decides and the deal is done
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0128564_0128777	yeah i've i've got one at home
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0058775_0059063	we've got the air
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0010968_0011206	okay
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0065568_0066182	it's not my work okay
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0140381_0140763	thought it might be hundred to put a battery state's display on it
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0096816_0097227	three three three three
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0072127_0072250	and he uses a different line with
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0070024_0070319	it's my regression about the donation
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0020335_0021274	but on the corner information there was real remote instead of a real reaction
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0040261_0040873	it's very simple and it's easy to draw your fingers and drawings on there
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0113775_0114717	we can do it within a certain so we hafta focus on different kinds of users different kind of customers as well
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0001346_0001673	the morning
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0009919_0010145	oh i'll start with the presentation key
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0012529_0013476	we put a lot of effort in design and in the prototype itself
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0059684_0059878	it's okay
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0017525_0017917	you know it's a point where we've done a bit
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0004590_0004703	but
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0080139_0080540	okay
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0060429_0060744	it's
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0112648_0112946	our proof of age is fifty million years
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0048367_0049213	the only thing we hafta look after is that we use different colors and different lines with
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0147559_0147956	just that that you just keep the tape tight
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0167313_0167540	don't think there's much to be gained in that area
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0032210_0032702	children's collection was also included to be used very frequently
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0123095_0123267	yes
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0096340_0096614	so this is a secret over
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0189311_0189747	and it wouldn't be touch screen or very expensive screen but
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0194768_0195087	generally fun
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0177991_0178153	because i think that's
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0145856_0146019	or he stayed there
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0067608_0068347	well what i was thinking about was keep the general function like the air
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0141918_0142419	because what you told is the gentleman collection is important
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0209085_0209464	it's better to put it on different markets with
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0009312_0009719	so that you can move on to the second phase
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0133100_0133414	sixteen to forty five age category
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0162025_0162220	and i don't know if many children would
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0037943_0038068	design
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0190417_0190679	so some extra info
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0198880_0199316	and that's especially surprised at the dark group
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0089709_0089819	we would hafta look into that
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0162508_0162612	for many years i have that
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0203801_0203905	so it's the
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0147057_0147374	is anybody really angry
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0112666_0113257	there's a big party for the marketing experts
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0058658_0059215	thank you for using the general function of the remote control
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0142809_0142949	okay
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0017511_0017947	so i should just let's start with the first presentation
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0058444_0058658	yeah
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0089727_0090130	yeah maybe i can first leave to your presence
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0183919_0184252	and you just press the button and the phone goes ringing
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0205042_0205196	to look into that a little more
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0176788_0177115	is a lot in the budget we have
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0157740_0158506	because if you wanna switch from central one to thirty five you don't wanna push the next central button thirty five times
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0156213_0156360	if you feel only
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0174570_0174717	like other functions
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0193639_0193800	oh
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0035438_0035637	they won't spend their money very easily
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0203850_0204211	if we're able to really bring an entire project
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0193270_0193639	let's see what did we say
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0158491_0158797	maybe he can implement the scroll button
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0064041_0064353	yeah yeah
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0206234_0206344	in every country
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0061158_0062113	yeah i've been thinking about simple money to put a lot of funds in one one remote control
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0110739_0111063	maybe also on television it will be amazing well
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0031550_0032074	you're not really used very frequently but or still considered to be of some importance
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0137251_0137367	you don't have the clothes
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0178256_0178456	that's a good french point as well
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0170166_0170339	opposite on the other side
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0068347_0068665	the umbrella
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0093285_0093468	the usual practice a bunch
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0177604_0177913	and if the robe stays rather small it should be proper yeah
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0114648_0115449	and we hafta be very attentive in putting the course of instruction in our progress
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0092777_0093003	first about how it works
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0029867_0030117	and jelly's got a six and a half
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0205739_0206094	oh i don't think they have different television sets
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0070895_0071491	what i was thinking about was you got
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0178456_0179363	if we have a fancy looking station or very well yeah so that that's the nice recovery
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0087143_0087685	it's for
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0079706_0079809	yeah
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0193869_0194233	should be fancy design easy to learn
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0009959_0010273	one first and one second
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0161363_0161899	the tv would need an a function where you can actually view all channels and scroll through it
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0010273_0010705	there's a little education in the arc community
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0187315_0187701	and think since a lot of people interacted that a new remote control is hard to learn
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0197899_0198437	think probably older people would be a little bit more careful with their remote controls
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0129104_0129298	yes but it's not the biggest part of it
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0088627_0088837	well we certainly make a fancy dinner
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0209464_0209598	okay
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0057741_0058050	yeah i should go to the talking
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0015769_0016354	and then we can have a little discussion about the new project regulations which have been sent to me
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0093099_0093285	everybody knows how remote works
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0151402_0152064	so i think that attack's can be very useful in an attack
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0032702_0032943	one hundred and sixty eight times per hour
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0163275_0163548	they're not used to using crots
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0111672_0112578	that's the the picture you hafta to dark it because we're going to develop a new project which is especially designed for the younger customers
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0190939_0191060	think that's a good idea as well
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0180850_0181039	like to have extra in the remote control
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0079809_0079945	so that's the
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0027508_0027939	and fifty percent of the people included that they remote ended to get lost in their room
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0126238_0126970	if we put a lot of effort in those we can make a remote control with the just two or three buttons
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0052436_0052805	but up until forty five it remains feasible
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0142763_0142882	yeah
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0079945_0080395	and the the real business is we hafta use
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0175413_0175845	yeah i mean we obviously needed a good way to purchase the buttons and
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0162693_0163275	and besides that it's if we're gonna focus on elementary people they'll hafta adapt
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0182000_0182443	yes well fifty percent of the people included in the remote control tend to get lost
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0166497_0167313	because i think they're pretty many remote controls that can only operate the tv which already only have the minimum number of buttons
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0184706_0185126	it's not too expensive just
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0206761_0207008	we've got five minutes left
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0167618_0167813	the number of puddles
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0104926_0105724	so i'm the progress manager so i'm here to mess things up and tell you some new recipes
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0182965_0183188	yeah that was what i suggested
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0114304_0114648	removes control and the way around
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0017291_0017511	so we've gone forty minutes for all of it
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0191151_0191307	but i don't know if that would
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0116026_0116572	and we hafta be very clear on this point as well
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0149346_0149725	another point of advantage in our remote control
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0148167_0148477	it's a good idea as well especially for the suburbs
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0023220_0023526	see what the market consists of
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0066354_0067014	five but this umbrella umbrella got a lot of benefits
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0123533_0123878	besides that i think the market for forty plus is like
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0125292_0125439	and not enought
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0062994_0063317	but it must be useta be
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0199966_0200687	because i think what we're going to decide now is for people above sixty maybe
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0121414_0122133	in addition people encouraged that text simply was an important feature for the remote control
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0074276_0074438	there's a tree
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0124406_0124593	but i'm not sure if this is the right
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0089266_0089531	it's very fragile and you can get scatters on it
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0212102_0212432	useta decide on the use of infrastructure and the transportation
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0136466_0137249	yeah if we make a remote control just with that i think
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0135277_0136073	thinking that if we put our marketing right we can sell this just like i don't know if you've heard about it in the news
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0096005_0096340	it's a very simple device speaking
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0153794_0154038	don't think that's really easy anymore because
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0023890_0024460	well these are three quite interesting results i thought
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0115449_0116026	so it hasta be visible in our design in the way our designs and the way our designs
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0072551_0073217	and this the remote control and you got here the general functions
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0030700_0030927	then there's one time use fountain
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0111183_0111672	the customer is forty plus
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0083631_0084232	well i think if we're gonna use a touch screen we're gonna go way above the twelve and a half hours
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0133626_0134077	because they are critical and they they want a fancy remote control
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0172304_0172602	they'd they'd cost a big marketing
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0181259_0181390	oh
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0068974_0069596	everybody everybody knows it so you don't hafta change that
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0155441_0155821	follow him up follow him down and some jelly
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0204681_0204871	yeah
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0014502_0015365	and we've gotten forty minutes for the whole presentations
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0214081_0214385	so i think you for this meeting
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0033502_0034115	exactly of the market consists of users between the age of sixteen and forty six
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0092001_0092351	it's not too much okay
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0093468_0093999	they remove determines what but it is uses the infrastructure to send the signal to the tv
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0012157_0012339	it's in ringo ringo
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0202807_0203198	oh i think it would be really good for for the communication
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0049655_0049890	so you know where it is in the room
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0101208_0102046	so it's in my idea it's it's gonna be smart to invest in the project itself
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0143323_0144055	now we we haven't fought it yet so i think tableq tableq can be
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0092373_0092777	okay i've got a presentation about the working design
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0083172_0083306	okay
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0022936_0023220	and in addition we did some market research
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0081303_0081664	old even of old people young people
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0164236_0165076	yeah they can see how much business they're going to be on the display and if it's too much you can consider it
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0148680_0148786	maybe
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0205234_0205344	okay
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0157219_0157339	maybe we can
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0213492_0213955	and the professional coaches will be sent to you by the the personal coach
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0160699_0161089	don't think there are many tvs that can switch channels that fast
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0176306_0176456	yeah
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0094422_0094811	so we've got the the plate
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0194469_0194768	took me station el cl
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0044727_0045175	one this will be beautiful to the design of the road
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0184323_0184706	so odyssey should be possible as well
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0143035_0143275	but obviously the board ten to decide
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0164005_0164236	just the numbers yeah
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0034874_0035285	they like to use new new functions
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0146664_0146971	it would definitely be a bad idea not to include that
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0149725_0150587	if he make a button for example for big soldiers which is interesting on the remote control
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0142419_0142809	volume section power and
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0148948_0149123	make that
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0026467_0026733	an addition remote are not very functional
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0073217_0074145	and on off button sound i don't know and here you got kind of a disaster
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0024753_0024963	seventy five percent of the
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0116878_0117215	let's have a discussion on the control functions
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0144197_0144587	can be a fountain as well
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0159304_0159450	there are other ways too
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0051958_0052436	mostly people in the age of sixty to twenty five
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0159649_0160168	the sonny tone phone has a scroll button which is very useful in searching names or
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0010914_0011288	there's a goose mouse again
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0056775_0057117	for the technical functions of or if it
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0126970_0127577	or just a reminder that it is forty percent of the market because it is forty percent of the market
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0046539_0046695	they shouldn't break down easily
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0139830_0140726	or decide for younger people so maybe we can focus ourselves on the elementary people
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0132456_0132604	so let's try it
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0065128_0065479	yeah
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0018794_0019337	it's maybe it's easy for you yeah i think you will tell you in your presentation as well
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0012339_0012853	so it should be over in a while couple of days
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0138722_0139011	yeah i simply think
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0006370_0006777	okay so this is our second meeting
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0090130_0090669	well and then we'll have a little discussion about the recipes and that kind of thing
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0022556_0022822	we had one hundred of these tests
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0136073_0136281	the the elderly mobile phone
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0206842_0207000	yeah okay
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0056028_0056139	okay
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0152064_0152168	oh
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0166167_0166497	having a few buttons as possible
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0186523_0186974	you i think we will hafta choose us between the dog and the man
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0043379_0043672	besides of course the road must be very nice
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0138068_0138346	change our focus on the progress and i think
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0160326_0160525	there's two but
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0099441_0099841	oh i think we should focus on this the decision the usage of it
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0041757_0042217	it's certainly something to take into account
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0084251_0084427	oh i i don't think so
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0202427_0202807	if we should do something like that it would be
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0167813_0168082	it's very important in the design
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0129558_0129973	and besides that they're not very critical so i mean they don't really care
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0191464_0191584	it's the small screen
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0171766_0172184	so i think it would be very hard to actually gain on the competition here
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0158984_0159154	or a joystick
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0192941_0193270	thing that could be possible as well
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0113257_0113682	because he was amazing on the the younger persons
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0078648_0078763	oh
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0210596_0210808	okay
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0036524_0036731	they're not really very interesting in the features
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0156251_0156713	so we can't skip the this place so we don't need it
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0007276_0007726	now we're going into the final design
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0054992_0055160	then at the second
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0047164_0047851	then as a lot of people interacted that their remote got lost in the room it might be
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0152324_0152617	funnelicity should be a few butts you said
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0177403_0177504	because it's gonna be
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0175939_0176153	but i don't think we should spend very much time in that
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0188928_0189068	which would tell you what it does
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0122133_0122543	so think it's pretty dumb to put no twelve o t x feet on it
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0069903_0070183	my personal preferences
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0157258_0157508	think if you're gonna choose jelly
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0025097_0025633	people questioned whether it was ugly
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0132822_0132961	three i think that would be the case in the
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0123298_0123436	oh
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0093999_0094301	the tv witch is to the company or what function it is
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0036731_0036997	but they do tend to spend their money a lot easier
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0052805_0053574	there were so great creates the production cost but i think these are just some small factories we could consider
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0144587_0144776	but only if if it's done
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0083042_0083237	it was the money part of it
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0049890_0050392	and in addition to this it could recharge the batteries in the remote if you put it in
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0057571_0057860	we got a blend of time so
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0087816_0088287	twenty years or less
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0130070_0130315	what the remote control is like
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0082268_0082577	so
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0012853_0013438	it's going to be cold anyway so i don't think you're gonna need it
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0026733_0027332	about fifty percent of the people useta use about ten percent of the buttons on a remote control
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0078034_0078621	so you you never got all the buttons on one side
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0208209_0208360	and different languages you know
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0030335_0030700	mostly important functions of the remote control
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0136509_0136610	have you heard that
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0154417_0154858	but i mean it if it's only for tv you're not gonna need a lot of buttons anyway
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0145903_0146395	but dead people needta wait for for somebody
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0173197_0173663	one of the arguments to make it only for the tv because we didn't have the time to market it a lot
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0015365_0015769	so i guess we take about seven minutes per presentation
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0040047_0040342	to make a fancy design
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0187166_0187291	it will be too much as well
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0021426_0022302	we have been doing research in a university lab where we employed users operating remote controls
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0020965_0021091	but you already knew that
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0214385_0214656	and i think we have a lunch break now
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0046162_0046539	because they're used most and so they should be roof
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0180192_0180428	yeah i think maybe we should do some research to
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0078621_0079045	so that's my idea about it
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0022302_0022556	we left them fill out a question
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0105824_0106739	that's we've got to decide remote which is only suitable for tv
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0079045_0079323	yeah and
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0016439_0017291	and then the decision on the control functions which you wanna include and those which you don't wanna include
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0185920_0186591	if that will rise the cost too much because
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0118933_0119896	yeah because you're you're saying that firstnamet second is gonna be used anyway pretty soon
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0054103_0054516	so and anybody have any questions until now
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0044041_0044727	as a lot of people only use about ten percent of the buttons i think we should make very few buttons
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0153532_0153701	so to keep it simple
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0096802_0097017	the power source
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0124958_0125107	and then umbrella
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0173800_0174434	so you could better focus on for example the documentation
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0086683_0086961	yeah quite and
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0191519_0191635	there's fit into the
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0042921_0043379	so these are two factors that i think should be included in the design
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0034414_0034874	mean character this group is that they're very critical on the remote control
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0171006_0171553	there's not a lot of functions required so most executing remote control
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0005751_0006002	everybody found his place again
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0095206_0095983	when the user presents a button a child goes to the ladder and transmits it to the tv
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0088539_0088654	it's nice
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0154858_0155329	you need the one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0051711_0051826	three this was
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0196037_0196280	and details
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0017947_0018134	who wants to be first
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0110183_0110739	enthusiastic just to go in a function we can use
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0013438_0013584	then i'm angry
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0057117_0057273	the
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0203379_0203681	and i think they would be good market for it
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0108096_0108600	another point is we hafta skip the
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0183188_0183919	yeah yeah yeah some phones too with you have a talking station
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0029664_0029867	the power button got in nine
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0014036_0014375	you're going to have a presentation
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0154391_0154617	if it's only for jelly
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0100488_0101105	and you only hafta decide a remote one and if it's high enough to decide a remote one and if it's high enough to decide a remote one
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0199316_0199966	because i'm always talking about elementary elementary people or people from forty to eighty
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0113682_0114200	so we hafta find the market which is above forty plus but which will suit our
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0096614_0096802	you've got the buttons
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0038600_0038984	have to focus on the eight eight six sixteen to forty five
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0043807_0043933	unfortunately
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0104177_0104926	okay now i hope everybody has a little bit more inside in the functions we're all have and what we're doing right now
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0139312_0139830	that the new products we're gonna make specifically designed
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0168763_0169041	and if you have less products you can do a lot more with
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0040660_0041614	the results oh it about one quarter of the people questioned thought that the remote control course asked firstnamea
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0047962_0048678	and i say it might be because it would certainly business the production costs a lot
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0127660_0128305	and if you look in the whole generation of forty plus
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0018374_0018562	okay
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0190015_0190170	just the normal scene
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0030117_0030222	so these are the most
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0103836_0103943	yeah
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0181117_0181259	that's a good point
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0145134_0145705	because i don't know if it will be a lot more money to implement this as well but i don't think that it will be a problem
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0168193_0168763	you can make a very fancy design with putting the buttons on the right places
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0204248_0204535	and you're looking about sixty two eighty for example
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0152829_0153239	that's very important we have a few
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0130315_0130688	they're just pretty much take the first thing they see and which looks excellent
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0119896_0120197	and new tvs will have internet access on them
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0185430_0185692	one is the elcsc
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0170217_0170897	because if you have a a rod controlled only to operate a tv they're simple not a lot of buttons required
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0151220_0151330	that's a good idea
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0009719_0009959	but first this face
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0067014_0067502	yeah people don't like it so
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0054623_0054829	about financial recovery
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0033214_0033502	then this is the market
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0192427_0192580	it's a little bit and a little
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0020813_0020965	the market expert
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0182457_0182939	so maybe we should involve the o t or something
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0079456_0079706	let's see
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0146395_0146506	so it's yeah
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0099094_0099441	keep the inner working simple so it's robust
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0013747_0013911	just time i will take the minute
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0204510_0204648	yeah the really
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0045670_0046162	especially the children's collection and oh location buildings
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0021210_0021426	have done some research
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0214794_0214936	so it's a good thing
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0190238_0190469	it's a small screen with two
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0189896_0190015	just the ol c t
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0179700_0179902	so we're just gonna focus on the exercises
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0136552_0136731	very big exercise
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0134196_0134605	people of forty plus i mean they wanted to work but
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0157711_0157911	maybe he can use the
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0031087_0031550	there the audio settings video settings and channel settings buttons
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0107878_0108096	so it hasta be simple
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0187701_0188355	and we're focusing on elderly people here which tend to have a hard time understanding new devices
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0125241_0125383	yeah i think we can
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0048678_0048985	but it might be a good idea to make a documentary
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0124422_0124559	yeah it's it's
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0056139_0056775	oh i've been looking at that useta ask of it
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0068665_0068974	yeah yeah like a umbrella
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0085768_0086683	and i've seen something on the internet not too day but a few weeks ago
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0023526_0023664	what age is he involved
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0188355_0188928	it may be a good idea to have just a little screen on it which would explain a button if you press it
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0082698_0082833	yeah i
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0176456_0176671	do you think the dog station will
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0208521_0209085	or you hafta put a language button in it but that will be a bit unnecessary i think
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0014375_0014502	all of you
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0122736_0122840	you're pretty much exactly it
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0165328_0165493	or they don't hafta be a ladder
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0156200_0156318	but do you know
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0169161_0170001	that's true but i think not much to gain on the competition when you when you're making a remote control only for to operate only the tv
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0097468_0098059	the chip creates the umbrella and perhaps a normal book
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0006124_0006370	that's nice
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0122956_0123091	again the next day it's
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0028894_0029664	celebration and valentine on a scale of one to ten on a scale of one to ten for celebration
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0063317_0064041	so yeah you you can put a lot of functions in one yeah
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0020685_0020813	my name was firstnamef from poland
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0038068_0038336	but i think we should make a move for the future
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0159450_0159649	just look if you look at therapy
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0089605_0089727	that's right
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0116572_0116721	so i should just
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0028533_0028894	then we did some research to the most relevant questions
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0180531_0180733	what older people like to have in a
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0085069_0085648	yeah one college yeah
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0128305_0128992	it's the the biggest share of the whole population now
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0209880_0210323	then a few small things
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0097017_0097468	and when a button gets pressed it goes goes to the chip
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0062844_0062948	so
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0165076_0165328	but i think that won't be very much but
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0197688_0197944	so i think you know
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0098558_0099094	well i think we should use defensive medicine simple plastic
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0150587_0151173	for older people that they can think okay i wanna have surgeries and they push the button and they get the big surgeries
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0030927_0031087	that's what i like to call them
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0035285_0035438	but they're so very critical
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0177426_0177604	if it's not too fancy
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0064536_0064638	umbrella
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0177261_0177426	it could be possible yes
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0117494_0117796	so is there any discussion possible about the new project regulations
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0130873_0131668	but don't you think that if we make a move which is typically made for this market
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0138501_0138636	we can sell this
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0083306_0083610	and you know it was questions about the technical functions
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0081664_0082268	so you must keep a business quite simple and quite quite large
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0011288_0012018	but that means that you can have a little trouble with the air conditioning that's because of this
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0038336_0038480	and this means we would
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0157508_0157740	and i think many people like to use that
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0181642_0181868	you said they easily get lost as well
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0065479_0066318	got many functions in one remote control but yeah you can see this is quite simple
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0025633_0026285	and an initial eighty percent it would spend more money on a fancy looking room
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0088287_0088515	so it's possible
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0039082_0039938	one this also makes up most the biggest part of the market so that would also be where our our main project would be gettable
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0194233_0194469	five buttons we took about that
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0165401_0166063	but i think if you're gonna make a remote control only to operate a tv there's not much you can gain on
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0098059_0098324	when you press the button you can actually see your pressed button
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0144873_0145134	higher the the cost
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0064353_0064588	one room
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0156654_0157219	but do you need the buttons for one two three
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0084751_0085069	it's not an engine or something
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0070183_0070706	use a dispute for a speech function of the different types
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0189596_0189709	okay okay
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0185126_0185279	another
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0042217_0042921	and thirty four percent thought that it was hard to learn how to operate a new control remote control
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0120197_0120863	but i think if you're talking people of forty plus the chance that they will have a tv with internet access
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0172285_0172393	so he can
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0201135_0201925	if we want participate this with for example the the telephone for entirely people we can
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0211226_0212102	what you're going to do for the next meeting is the insurance company will do the complaint
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0209598_0209880	so that's the
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0013584_0013747	first the opening
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0035786_0036423	the users of forty six to fifty five years they make up forty percent of the market
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0045327_0045670	and i think the most frequent use of buttons should be infrequent
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0137249_0137872	we don't hafta focus on on the decide then but on the
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0163548_0163860	so perhaps we should stick to the basic lay out
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0146597_0146751	so i guess
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0161089_0161238	so you would need
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0037535_0037811	what i think this involves for
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0109601_0110069	and it's funny we don't need an umbrella
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0197489_0197688	so it doesn't really matter
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0207517_0207794	you know it would be a lot easier to
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0174959_0175210	instead of
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0207894_0208113	attempted to different courses
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0080994_0081294	everybody hafta use it so
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0131668_0132456	the people think that's the the disease i've looked for all though i didn't realize it
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0019337_0019787	just which function you have and what you're gonna talk about
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0125551_0126238	three i think you can do a lot with the design and the simple buttons which are so important
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0120976_0121278	within the next twenty years it's very slim
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0057462_0057571	yeah you can take your time
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0080395_0080994	use quite large breads for yeah
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0094811_0095206	and it's got complete disks for every button
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0024460_0024753	remember being confused ugly
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0183158_0183548	with your keychain if you wish it goes and it makes a sound
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0205344_0205642	and different courses
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0088968_0089266	but the it wouldn't be very robust
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0075919_0076452	and you got here real business for sliding a device
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0006777_0007100	and still fading
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0099841_0100301	because if you're going to use high technology the price is going to go sky high
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0124320_0124873	but i mean if i see this it's i think we're just gonna go for another
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0006002_0006124	yeah
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0062113_0062844	so you got a lot of aphasia dementia therapy
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0202051_0202252	the real entirely people
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0134753_0134976	as soon as it works it's okay with them
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0207058_0207517	and the little screen it with which explains the buttons
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0210808_0211226	well put the minutes in the progress document file
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0048985_0049629	and this would could get a button in it which would then be
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0084427_0084751	you got quite a piece of chocolate
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0130770_0131353	okay let me just choose for the bed
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0002425_0002837	there's a third meeting already
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0174291_0174398	let's see
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0184486_0184687	so
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0074312_0074615	it's most
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0149655_0150094	well no i think we should've done just just decide one
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0081673_0082321	for the energy source we can use a basic battery or as an operational thing
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0227452_0227764	and then i guess we'll start in thirty minutes again
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0009600_0009800	you have about forty minutes
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0065300_0065977	yeah and we hafta keep in a general business so i've got the businesses we hafta use
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0024509_0024960	most important thing is the fancy design
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0171773_0172086	especially if they have the same writing on it
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0172641_0173234	kinda make a remote which you can flip over and use
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0128122_0128372	so that brings her back to the energy
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0024960_0025462	the research involved that that was by far the most important factor
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0203714_0204151	and to put and the a button for
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0196328_0196430	yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0029507_0029830	okay these are some more groups specific finding
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0181069_0181520	because the problem in the window will be open and all kinds of
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0226173_0226653	yeah it's it's here for
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0139515_0140064	it's a little more difficult to to get in the right shape
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0039958_0040170	so it would be kinda more telephone
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0201075_0201425	to make this side
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0110186_0110964	but i think it's more efficient and cheaper to put it in the digging station
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0089554_0089817	but depends on what we want
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0003961_0004309	versatility three
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0143261_0143413	you could see the cases
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0053794_0053930	yeah and
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0079471_0079573	that's it
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0199283_0200043	maybe it's possible to make this side like let's see
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0158991_0159180	and you can
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0182100_0182349	maybe she's
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0108773_0109157	so maybe a documentation will help them give the remote place
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0120250_0120970	and on top of that the elcisco screen would help in making the remote control easier to use
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0121791_0121961	oh i think that's a good point
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0130356_0130466	and much better
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0075199_0076041	so and especially business for shipping up and shipping down
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0195514_0195759	because it's a bit of an angle
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0206592_0206761	and then flip it up side
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0111626_0112214	and then we can still use the voice recognition but maybe then for only the the children
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0046820_0047237	there's some research about the injury
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0137033_0137275	look i've gotten you most control and the
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0203157_0203536	so it's yeah for so
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0053386_0053794	let's see
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0061666_0061790	oh
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0220198_0220771	but you're going to get your instructions by the coach
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0186534_0186785	because that's the basis is you're building on
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0212509_0213175	and then we can have a little bit off here and here maybe
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0139459_0139560	probably
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0061035_0061248	and yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0095554_0096021	and i think we can talk about the energy sources since that's
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0206339_0206592	if she can have this one you turn it like this
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0144813_0145796	because it's it's something other roads don't have which we can get a great advantage point
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0185783_0185988	and one and another way
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0151853_0152059	see that's a good good
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0137188_0137359	oh i don't know
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0183799_0183930	yeah she was in a general
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0158787_0158889	well or besides it
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0048681_0049088	to do in or decide
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0049675_0050406	the i found some something about speech recognition
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0139212_0139515	oh i think so because yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0046417_0046820	yeah yeah it's
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0047237_0047969	yeah last meeting we had about using a few minutes
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0103372_0103559	get great popularity for a project
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0018267_0018452	good
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0060394_0060972	you can just give a sign to say sound off or
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0098719_0099113	you don't wanna swing before you can watch television
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0031200_0031633	the miniature for older people
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0180434_0180553	it's the police and the man
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0079633_0079787	thank you
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0177270_0177482	here's the little little city street
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0186194_0186534	oh i think we should start by by choosing a case
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0156003_0156236	doesn't really matter for the price or the quantity
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0089817_0090047	and i think we should discuss that
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0121214_0121773	and i think a boy's recreation function would not make the remote control much easier to use
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0033107_0033520	one this leaves us to some personal preferences
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0004309_0004844	okay this is the second face we're going to discuss today
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0213608_0213958	and then the rest of the buttons over here
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0107490_0107720	but it's true a little bit
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0020995_0021224	we've done some marketing research
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0160188_0160709	maybe he can make a little drawing of it
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0009911_0010221	so so just get started
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0098436_0098719	but i don't think that's really an operation
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0042533_0042730	people with less means
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0015611_0015755	maybe you can work it out
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0166715_0167669	and on the other side button for for the sound
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0033520_0033933	the remote control and the cooking station should blend in in the
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0090047_0090706	for the case the solution and the buttons really depends on the designer
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0008404_0008621	then we have three presentations
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0153151_0153312	could you explain that a little more
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0012469_0012758	the region and the dark market
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0091621_0091739	okay
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0101923_0102499	and besides that you mentioned it would make theucking station complete
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0051584_0052263	yeah just you've just to focus on the primary functions
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0112333_0112954	one i'm wondering what will the voice recognition mean for the protection price
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0009142_0009383	how we going to make it
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0193316_0193600	so those are the free options we have
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0185566_0185783	make it a bit more fancy
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0226788_0227235	so if you wanna have a look at it it's over there in the project folder
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0224481_0224778	so that's basically it
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0044059_0044222	oh that's it
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0219286_0219527	and product evaluation
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0174621_0174748	blanko
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0071219_0071824	just you can put on on the bread and over there in this corner
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0006622_0007580	these are hopefully the points you address in your practice sessions you're going to show me in a few minutes
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0005162_0006095	and a few points of interest in this meeting are the conversation
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0138925_0139061	and i don't know
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0137803_0138136	so it wouldn't actually have to be good yeah if it's just
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0201850_0202217	but so in the fourth of your hand
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0059078_0059315	so yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0050406_0050725	so maybe we're gonna use that
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0088725_0088913	four the phone should fall below
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0083360_0083601	so i don't think it's really an option
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0141930_0142143	maybe it's possible
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0129126_0129227	oh
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0165829_0166715	it's probably to program it's so you got on the right side business for shipping and shipping yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0057459_0058127	it's possible to to make quite a difference for speech recognition
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0177772_0178107	now i hafta think
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0204961_0205386	but i think it's better to put the scene on top
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0077623_0078316	so and the other function for separate one but for sound
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0151424_0151767	so everybody's okay with the changing courses
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0043838_0043943	oh
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0097798_0097992	yes they're four operations
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0196767_0197266	oh you got a girl of course or i believe yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0061248_0061666	celebration put the
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0130590_0130714	and that's the best choice
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0100902_0101010	okay
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0167669_0167929	or
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0034226_0034797	so this would mean no i catching designs
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0174029_0174194	then you hafta
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0012177_0012469	these are the points we created on
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0123848_0123971	so pretty large
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0038550_0039085	there's pretty much a new hope to old people
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0082829_0083360	but if we choose for that option the digging station would come up
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0074788_0075199	yeah the place where people most often look at
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0004844_0005162	it's the component design meeting
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0154727_0154954	and would would single core and double core mean
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0194709_0195514	so that elementary people can use the remote control and at the same time look easily at the screen
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0006125_0006409	because of course special because of design
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0105280_0105864	okay but i won't use much energy i i believe
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0050939_0051241	yeah and using a little desk
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0159369_0159722	so the interface
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0110964_0111441	so you have a button button on your clothing station which you can push and then it starts beating
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0078471_0079304	and the overall decide yeah we hafta decide about it
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0202695_0203157	so so the remote control have to leave your hands
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0205911_0206150	but this place
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0063253_0064204	double click because you get a big spectacle for a people
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0094506_0094825	so these are the points we have to discuss
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0133455_0134119	which brings his a little bit back to marketing as well
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0148357_0148770	so you should decide two different options
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0113733_0114557	because in our earlier market research if you'd allow me to go to the spreadsheet spreadsheet
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0100360_0100754	well you you basically shake your robe and then it pours up
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0161537_0162139	we can just use the regular form of it but it's not quite fancy
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0162457_0163200	you said you wanted to put the changing changes button on the right side so you could
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0164156_0164342	so it would be great for that
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0062754_0063187	one one pouch on the bottom you get small tablets
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0207042_0207490	because maybe your hand is in the way if you hafta display here
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0197849_0197953	oh yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0084583_0084859	it's really up to the design that we're gonna use
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0103844_0104007	what
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0113083_0113198	that's a good point
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0034797_0035557	just keep it simple and well the cooking station and the small screen would be her main point of interest
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0036393_0036896	so it would be very important that we at least included these features
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0211725_0211875	five minutes no
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0030102_0030533	they like recognizable shapes and familiar to them
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0022728_0023525	and i've completed some additional training courses after the official training courses returned about what the
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0183389_0183981	that baby that nobody should have any problems with chasing a child or
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0146887_0147517	because we would hafta make one more control which would fit in with a window cover and the
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0152494_0153151	and i heard our university of florida and double core yes
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0097125_0097927	it is possible to introduce new energy in our budget you know
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0182349_0183117	but is it a problem that left-handed persons use a different hand
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0041998_0042227	the great black color for it while
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0003093_0003346	and anyway
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0198945_0199055	there's a
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0157966_0158071	okay
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0190736_0191632	so this type should be better for you or better should prevent repetitive strain injury
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0073271_0073416	so
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0044222_0044365	okay i'm going to the next one
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0041809_0041998	people with more money
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0151065_0151305	so but that shouldn't be too much of a problem
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0173854_0173980	you mean
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0069546_0070161	so made a little picture of it
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0086677_0087326	and the chip set it's as simple as but it should be awesome because we're using an ol t scree
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0071824_0072571	almost all remote controls are using on the plane
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0154060_0154699	and or the manufacturing department can also do a little bit of course courses
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0171349_0171495	so people can get confused
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0065977_0066608	the onefound the number of nine
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0104423_0105196	yeah you could load up the bakery she could enter the find the lost remote connection
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0101010_0101706	well personally i don't think that all other people like to shake their remote control before he uses it
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0188024_0188151	it was good the flat pace
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0189358_0189993	the the single girl so i'm not really sure what they're gonna look for but i think it's something like this
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0025510_0026239	innovative was about half as important as the fancy design
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0213892_0214034	yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0113138_0113402	and i don't have any information on the prince
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0158525_0158749	one on top of the television then
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0223394_0224233	and i'm not sure if you're going to start right away to work together or i think you're going to fill in the questionnaires first
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0216188_0216423	that's my
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0056736_0057079	so using large large buttons
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0165095_0165355	for left-handed users also
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0076041_0076585	on place where the
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0139061_0139305	oh leave to research
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0148901_0149184	well i wouldn't sign a telephone but
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0026897_0027839	about half of the whole of importance was the was easy to use
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0181698_0181813	yeah that's not gonna work
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0115913_0116369	as if they would if people would pay more for speech recognition in a remote
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0131552_0131947	well there isn't any choice there because we're using the the the desk
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0084859_0085347	it doesn't involve any technical structures
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0049088_0049675	so finding a way to control the remote control
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0118532_0118810	but that would also go for the elcisco screen then i guess
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0199055_0199194	so this stuff
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0006409_0006622	and also transferring
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0158125_0158229	we go for that
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0147646_0147798	plastic cover
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0068609_0069546	and we can build in a function which shows the child or something which the therapy is on
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0200196_0200428	oh okay
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0073538_0074043	it's just a small place
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0208803_0209030	oh maybe she's just started on a branch
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0212281_0212509	here's the place and then buttons
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0092009_0092432	so it brings us to the discussion about our concepts
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0074043_0074312	you can put it on top
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0106811_0107293	so i believe one better is just enough
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0108077_0108773	and i don't think they they like memories just laying everywhere in their rooms
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0223007_0223394	let's see
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0014852_0015611	the things we thought of so maybe if you figure something else or thought of something else just let me know
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0021224_0021610	we discovered some more on cats questions
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0070975_0071219	yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0204692_0204831	yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0043309_0043495	thank you
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0055076_0055904	so it's a speech and practice and special but for selecting a subject
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0155007_0155622	it would just only affect the form for far as i know
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0051241_0051584	so finishing
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0214673_0214919	and they'd prefer a corner to be around
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0198362_0198503	hmhm
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0014661_0014791	maybe
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0011051_0011182	everything fine
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0002126_0002271	okay
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0117392_0117667	greatly improve not to do it
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0197400_0197849	so you want to put a this play over here
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0030533_0031093	and our service is pretty much
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0029830_0030102	the old people preferred dark colors
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0198688_0199153	you have it up side down or the last one
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0157846_0157967	oh just the lay down
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0098483_0098778	okay okay
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0002271_0002425	good enough
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0123063_0123744	well this was for an ol cl screeke like you would have on the most intense movie scene
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0109369_0110186	you can introduce four registration by finding back your road
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0143794_0144768	because then you can attend as well with give your grandmother and new case for his remote control or whatever
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0114265_0114438	yeah sure
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0159722_0160048	what type of insurance do we want to use
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0173572_0173789	functions as the normal one
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0185192_0185365	but maybe you have to
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0204286_0204620	changing the child over here
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0132127_0132465	okay that's fine
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0014137_0014661	the somebody has any company on these regions
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0087418_0088026	and as the tree wash she participated showed people like wood
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0064328_0064965	well we can read small parts
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0018191_0018300	oh start off then
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0210636_0210838	is this the core
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0188973_0189358	it's from the side so this is rather normal
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0056340_0056736	and yeah over all university of florida
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0119311_0119924	well this is yeah but this is here's the question was would you prefer it
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0037901_0038470	so you could imagine that remote control be standing up straight in the corner
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0148893_0149830	oh which you can apply yeah remote controls on which you can apply different cases for example
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0058127_0059078	you can think about when you lost your remote control you can call it and it's gives a a an an
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0115058_0115235	so it was open here
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0213175_0213421	just that's for left hand and right side
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0034045_0034226	in the room
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0134908_0135723	as we saw that it's not you know wicked is a lot more expensive to produce
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0009383_0009600	and then we're closing
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0182131_0182236	oh
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0018027_0018191	yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0064965_0065167	so
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0214034_0214463	but the umbrella still on
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0181982_0182100	oh i guess
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0158050_0158416	and the the cover of the the documenting station is also
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0168681_0169252	yeah yes of course we'll be a lot more difficult than that
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0193623_0193828	okay
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0168075_0168721	yeah we could do that but i'm not sure if that would be very good for the easy ease of use
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0195876_0196040	you say this
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0163200_0164156	so well that i think that's a very good point because i pointed out earlier that a lot of roads road roads
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0165067_0165324	yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0083687_0084583	for the manufacturing department can deliver a flat cake single or double crust cake
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0008215_0008404	first the opening
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0055904_0056247	just what he mentioned last meeting
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0011480_0012177	then a little thing about the last meeting
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0116827_0117229	so if that would increase the price for which we're selling or remote
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0207652_0208185	it's more logical to have it on top as well because on your mobile phone it's always above
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0094960_0095318	first
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0102499_0103267	and i think our doctor station could be one of the marketing issues with with which we could
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0156264_0156539	so we can pretty much just do whatever we want
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0090706_0091523	and the chip said really should be awesome because it would really be a simple remote control
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0171151_0171349	but you have extra buttons
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0145959_0146145	and oh the colors as well
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0157441_0157677	it's it's to be possible to stand up
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0100075_0100370	and how exactly does the kinetic energy work
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0008621_0009142	after that we hafta come to a decision on remote control
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0201670_0201850	umbrella umbrella
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0104066_0104374	yeah for for learning up the basics but
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0157677_0157912	or just only to lie down
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0041314_0041809	they would like for the more exclusive people
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0119924_0120250	so that doesn't really mean they wouldn't pay extra for it
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0207905_0208061	yeah so
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0180861_0181069	it's not very handy i think
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0088026_0088725	but it raises the price and it doesn't really fit the engine unless we would start two product lines
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0184589_0184712	yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0193828_0194709	the single girl because maybe the career is pretty good to put the the scene in
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0191855_0192274	and the double core looks something like this i guess
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0047969_0048534	so that's what i want to
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0003346_0003602	let's see
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0184179_0184486	it's just you using a umbrella
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0172236_0172417	see yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0126889_0127431	because it will increase cost significantly
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0128372_0129126	if you don't it force us a lot of energy to use
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0156932_0157318	but the form hasta
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0220854_0221642	so just i will put these minutes on the in the folder
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0086341_0086677	for the buttons we can use plastic or rubber
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0184460_0184589	yeah yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0150237_0150867	one remote but it would hafta be fancy with either the plastic one
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0017532_0018012	so she keep the same line up as last time
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0203461_0203581	so get your mouse
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0225026_0225240	and you can save this one in the
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0039085_0039958	so they would prefer a design where the remote control just lies flat in the docking station
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0096165_0096908	has a pretty big environment
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0085424_0086153	as a case problem we could i thought of that later a number of a number belt like an antique slipper
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0147798_0148153	the more regular one the more standard one
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0161144_0161381	there's somebody has ideas for a form or
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0010221_0010747	did someone encounter anybody during the preparation
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0082321_0082829	the kitten energy like in a watch just chase and it produce his energy
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0002837_0003093	help you enjoy the lunch
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0218081_0218575	it's important that the corporate design engine is going to be in the road
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0218575_0218819	so check out the computer side maybe
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0156412_0156537	big one yes
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0214360_0214498	yeah it's still here
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0208901_0209288	and i says just drive and drive and drive so then we get
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0109241_0109369	and also what you said
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0015844_0016334	and we're going to start at the sixty two to eighty years old customers
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0105864_0106811	it's just a small disability so i believe it will run on one battery for six months or more
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0205563_0206339	so it's about the here
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0062107_0062754	but i was thinking about a special button for a secret just one button to keep it a secret
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0175068_0175292	then you get
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0013769_0013987	and we're going to use detailed materials
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0163183_0163295	yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0170713_0170940	because it could be made all sentimental and stuff
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0016511_0017402	so now everybody knows what we're doing and i she's just let's get started with the presentations
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0099261_0099667	but not every room is very light so it's not a very good option
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0043495_0043736	and he questions about the tree
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0226653_0226788	smart boy's there it is
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0138617_0138850	but with color was a lot more expensive
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0219527_0220198	so the university and university of florida are going to work together on this one
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0066722_0067499	and the gentleman one but one but for shipping up and shipping down
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0113402_0113632	so i'll hafta ask the manufacturing department
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0023685_0024088	the best design would be
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0215121_0215344	but more friendly
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0167860_0167985	well that could
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0020397_0020995	come come gonna improve you about the train watching i've done over the past few days
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0184712_0184961	thank you for leaving the normal shape
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0198503_0198945	we can make it
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0145395_0145574	yeah but it's true
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0076721_0077038	so you you can easily ship up or ship down
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0155622_0156003	so it's just really just up to the decision department what we're gonna use
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0206838_0207060	but it's i don't know
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0096908_0097011	so
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0152388_0152555	change in case over
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0224233_0224361	and then you get the message
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0215759_0215951	slipper
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0107399_0108077	well i think elderly people just like to have everything in place
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0133009_0133455	and then we get to the point of the case
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0216954_0217512	we've got a general idea of the concepts and the materials we're going to use
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0097992_0098273	we could use the basic normal battery
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0187176_0187445	so i could draw them out
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0035557_0036270	because this would be the innovative in the remote control
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0024088_0024509	okay these are some over old finding
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0081438_0081673	about the cone's design
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0160901_0161144	on the the board
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0118947_0119165	it's a bit higher perspective but
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0117667_0118175	three i think that would be better to instead of one other project that is meant for the
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0125507_0125757	so if you don't want it you just don't use it
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0140079_0140497	it's a special to make a changeable race
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0159180_0159369	that's okay
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0204831_0204961	that's a good one
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0043097_0043203	that would be all
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0131947_0132100	so it's gotta be against
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0164342_0164900	maybe we could just make one of those buttons on both the left and the right side
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0143413_0143544	yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0088970_0089554	well the kindergarten stories are right fancy
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0050725_0050931	oh
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0131353_0131484	there brings it to the chip
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0026239_0026776	by november this means functions which are not featured in other remote courses
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0115361_0115594	we also
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0143544_0143794	think that's a very good question
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0153341_0154060	well the the general most older records are flat just straight
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0187144_0187404	yeah it's just
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0124348_0125054	well i personally think the ol c t and we wanna use with the extra information i think nobody has anything against it
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0167654_0167860	umbrella
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0205460_0205644	oh
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0072571_0073271	so people will recognize the umbrella
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0116369_0116827	well i can see here or dark group we not do that
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0098273_0098436	head headache
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0218891_0219286	the university of maryland is the same story
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0134119_0134652	if you wanna choose for wood or the black and gray
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0145796_0145959	so and then you can make them with color
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0183117_0183262	and i think the finger's are
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0217512_0218081	so now for the next meeting we'll have to look and feel decide
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0141783_0141896	change the cases
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0100516_0100747	you use it and it works
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0224778_0225026	maybe this one
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0125054_0125507	because it's just some extension and it's easy to enlarge as well
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0146246_0146670	we would hafta look carefully to the decide though
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0137139_0137803	well and i think the most important fact there is the window
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0127431_0127946	and i don't think it will be a lot easier to use as well
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0186691_0186832	yeah yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0077038_0077404	quite
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0099113_0099261	so it's
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0007708_0008215	but first i'll show you the aja
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0172417_0172825	or you hafta make a left for left
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0004211_0004450	our fourth and last meeting
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0066433_0066604	crisis
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0204416_0204530	excuse me
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0100114_0100440	and the regular chip is not possible
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0242384_0242889	oh then i think we can have a little subscription right now
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0232648_0232759	they
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0104040_0104203	it's a big
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0161584_0161756	ship look and feel
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0206702_0206819	they did work out
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0164998_0165536	if or company is if it's easily recognizable that they're company made it
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0003551_0003665	starts at three o'clock
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0073789_0074535	that's right but what's the big question of our remote then
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0220688_0220894	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0076774_0076876	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0078253_0078439	we we could see money on it
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0247833_0248137	picture i think
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0177373_0177514	and i had them works out
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0225853_0226438	and then it mediates the score and you can get one yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0147297_0147426	there's not familiar for them
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0063497_0063747	so and it's good for the design as well
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0166741_0167260	oh i hafta say this was a little hard because the minutes of our last meeting
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0185657_0185820	in the slow motion of the company
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0150380_0150789	and it's it's less frightening i think
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0172308_0172577	that's a bit tori
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0074539_0074689	only the talking station i guess
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0195915_0196020	okay
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0003665_0004211	let me see
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0028364_0028914	but i think these are all together quite quite a few
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0013106_0013608	then we'll do the progress evaluation and the closing after that
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0108779_0109349	with with they expect to have ten buttons for the numbers one to nine
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0153754_0153939	yes they are
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0045420_0046093	if we see i don't know if i filled it correctly so just correct me if you see something wrong
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0218865_0219036	yes yeah maybe
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0235536_0235728	what was it
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0221144_0221348	see you yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0059766_0060016	well think actually they're two
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0168714_0169001	it's the design fantasy on a scale of one to seven
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0210551_0210773	the the digital pen is very nice
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0051892_0052253	but then the biggest
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0018533_0019006	then there's the one two three four five six
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0156703_0156972	that was the point i forgot
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0111584_0111738	you just make it real simple
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0047771_0047964	so there's not much to
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0131840_0132737	but you can make quite a big room's control for just the same price as a small one
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0187904_0188353	thought we would have a lot of private thinking after this
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0134149_0134440	and cakes come right out of the machine
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0047159_0047280	okay
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0242558_0242728	but
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0076079_0076247	maybe we should move to a different area
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0238789_0239421	you can change markets by changing the front cover
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0067814_0068508	so you still got four buttons but just so
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0011128_0011851	we've been to see if everything we wanna do is all possible within our budget
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0047280_0047569	it's two years old
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0176928_0177045	hmhm
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0143629_0144030	it was better to have this princess just a bit earlier
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0250942_0251380	there somebody see the practice full
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0121515_0121659	and these are two buttons then
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0032014_0032295	so we could dance that one
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0106263_0106706	what if you have to crawl to page eight
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0219865_0219973	and that's the work
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0236226_0236421	if you're gonna extract this product
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0116703_0116970	looks a bit old maybe
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0010847_0011128	then we will look at the finances
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0133154_0133380	yeah it's a bit
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0213811_0214110	flip over or more precise
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0119389_0119627	then yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0211792_0211923	umbrella umbrella
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0090976_0091606	or we can leave out the ten buttons and take one scroll wheel for the program numbers
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0152829_0152952	that's right
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0256144_0256292	slippery of the progress
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0197969_0198284	did we move through the right phases you think
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0151805_0151906	only five buttons
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0014313_0014458	but first
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0047569_0047771	we need the umbrella
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0054504_0054640	sixteen and i believe so
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0213286_0213663	so you rather wanna have a flip over
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0204985_0205092	thank you ex
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0010431_0010847	then we'll set up some evaluation
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0093381_0093674	you're getting close
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0016318_0016630	the deafspots for the onoff button
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0155734_0156017	the professor
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0202182_0202434	yeah it wasn't enough room but the fire
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0230837_0231027	because i think
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0060170_0060336	but
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0197629_0197803	thank you
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0070564_0070849	but i think this really is for beginners anyway
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0106239_0106387	the thing that's the case with most of it
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0046788_0046989	there we can just
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0201997_0202171	because of the firemen she
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0162360_0162741	learned a very important fact here
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0075541_0075679	umbrella
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0025260_0025597	so the shipping but
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0160310_0160865	okay so it does some literature study study animal studies of the recovery
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0170105_0170392	is the disease infectious
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0044103_0044313	and i can tell you
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0050894_0051207	then we have the case medical problem
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0063982_0064253	let's see
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0218606_0218760	yeah you can extract this image
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0137000_0137171	the picture was very good
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0134440_0134932	and chicken quarters you hafta have a different different menu than a flat one
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0079161_0079432	my mother can't even send send a message
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0144030_0144412	before we went on to the whole side
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0059459_0059638	oh those are one i think
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0054498_0054741	goes to sixteen
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0145959_0146152	there will be a lot of marketing
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0026919_0027039	okay
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0123433_0123820	if you press the volume button you can control the volume with the scroll wheel
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0161756_0161905	obtained
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0025597_0026145	yeah yeah shifting up and on on tablets and shifting it down
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0245777_0246188	we can put these in the product as well
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0098534_0099412	but it would definitely drop cost a lot
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0050630_0050771	and i think you hafta keep it
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0229667_0229875	and any more ideas
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0130623_0130801	you get a a much more remote
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0048445_0048674	here we have the single girl
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0095856_0096061	until you've got the right number then you push it
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0042160_0042326	so they jump out
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0103711_0104097	but i think that's that is a big advantage for her
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0127873_0128246	yeah and we can leave the theater three in if we want
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0061647_0061922	just maybe afterno
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0127616_0127873	so we've gone one two three
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0125200_0125742	and that will make the use of the scroll wheel more obvious
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0054741_0055171	well that's will be even more than
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0067733_0067938	yeah yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0034258_0034430	we discussed it already
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0077108_0077625	don't you think if we can count this as one button
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0171025_0171189	seven
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0092797_0093082	if we have this one and we've got the outside
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0139381_0139563	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0035660_0035796	well you can't
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0098258_0098523	the thing that would be the end of her usefulness
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0044514_0045184	that we're going to have a pretty hard time proving this for twelve and all of years
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0146799_0147297	because if older people like familiar forms and familiar stuff
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0177235_0177373	it was
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0030312_0030651	and well the one off but then it's it's a mystery
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0194299_0194531	that's a pretty nice car
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0148713_0149057	we can stick it out a bit
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0187038_0187139	so there would be this
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0149480_0149709	maybe that's recognizable for them as well
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0002070_0002219	oh
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0232098_0232225	articles with the business
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0174943_0175151	do we have too many questions
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0005801_0006236	and this meeting we will discuss our final decide
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0103751_0103896	so
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0016914_0017143	then there's the volcano and chemical selectors
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0196833_0197091	that brings us to the principle of evolution
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0124160_0124291	if you do the same for the channel
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0230035_0230187	they're about the practice
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0252939_0253373	yeah i just put it in my documentation and that's okay
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0234146_0234459	and i think you can compose that as well
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0037127_0037580	he's just not much to gain here
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0164617_0164998	and break the window
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0067462_0067814	but i don't know if if it's cheaper
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0019665_0020108	so it's rather simple prototype
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0184632_0184738	well you have the umbrella
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0162741_0162952	it's functional
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0168408_0168623	oh
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0100879_0101028	yeah it's fun
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0163317_0163740	and are the those questions that are there are they are
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0177905_0178276	they're ugly not very functional and getting lost
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0021629_0022526	when you're in texas there usually are buttons where you just press it and you go to the next state's page
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0165903_0166081	so we're sposta evaluate right now
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0169037_0169151	oh i think it's fancy
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0017832_0018459	if you hold it and you press another button the help goes to the hospital
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0002917_0003189	okay
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0136803_0137008	but then again i mean
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0076329_0076577	that's another one
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0092604_0092797	and let's see
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0068502_0068755	yeah i think they come the the military
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0167947_0168409	it's it's giving hours by downloading the software
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0185246_0185657	and they wanna put fashion in their projects
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0123125_0123299	and just
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0051551_0051892	so that's not much to save either
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0109635_0109761	with only five buttons on it
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0203638_0203833	and just to be able to ask him
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0256701_0256986	maybe if to feel a little not a question air
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0084979_0085308	but it's probably to make one for twelve fifty
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0072110_0072807	all of a sudden the elc display i think it's too expensive for the disability we use
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0156462_0156642	and evaluation of the
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0030827_0031305	the umbrella and children you obviously needs those those
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0042859_0043583	then because we only have thirty minutes left i will move on to the finance part
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0038338_0038707	yeah it's right hard to draw on the white board
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0237812_0238244	it be more for the older people yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0161347_0161584	is the remote fancy
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0199853_0199991	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0036278_0036567	and that's the end
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0031435_0032014	the mute button could be replaced by pressing the volume down button twice
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0182391_0182495	we'd give you the four
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0012264_0012897	so we'll see if it fits within the twelve and a half year range
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0188610_0188785	it's this like after this are done
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0233184_0233323	that's a good point
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0024092_0024492	you can use the normal one two zero buttons
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0249784_0249996	there's another that work i guess
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0239421_0239648	that's one thing you can change it with
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0135087_0135349	think this is a really easy one
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0038452_0038595	then umbrella
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0249669_0249784	oh
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0178513_0178770	the production costs within the preproduction costs within the preproduction costs
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0193462_0193734	that's eighty four percent
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0054091_0054498	so if we let's first count the buttons we have now
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0154964_0155070	let's see
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0013608_0013797	if it's got forty minutes
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0170912_0171025	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0150789_0151461	if they see this design they think oh they're only five buttons and but but we'll see
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0046513_0046624	since it recovered
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0055171_0055282	it's
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0039939_0040252	yeah and we don't need a umbrella
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0146322_0146482	to get this to sell
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0112798_0113097	how to use the other bits as slices
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0089083_0089571	so you can stay below two fifty
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0062510_0062891	well i was thinking maybe you could just introduce three of those numbers to one button
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0064253_0064373	if you make this
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0028033_0028364	just a few buttons and large buttons
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0184352_0184632	is the company company recognized
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0048184_0048445	to save them
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0242985_0243121	oh it's very hard
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0008095_0008951	and this design detail design meeting we will discuss the look and feel of the design
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0096599_0096800	it's a school and book
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0183036_0183172	and i think it'd go for two
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0052309_0053124	so maybe we really should try to describe somebuts to keep our costs low
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0038453_0038660	it's a normal playing but
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0239648_0240492	so he can also try to reach the younger people by putting fancy clothes on on the market
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0222551_0222719	having this kind of meeting
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0046275_0046449	but maybe we can also use one
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0041860_0042160	with a different color than the case
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0127182_0127540	umbrella umbrella
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0039654_0039801	yeah yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0084537_0084716	the magic will get you to school
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0093430_0093535	or getting closer
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0105892_0106058	but the subtleties stay there
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0087547_0087698	we want to make a
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0235728_0236002	forty five and fifty five and a half
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0238796_0239004	they're particularly for younger people
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0112275_0112622	and we can keep our ol c d square which can provide extra information
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0147616_0147830	so we're gonna do a lot of converting them
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0097748_0097915	so you won't need a umbrella
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0170443_0170561	thank you
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0036435_0036581	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0056221_0056363	okay i'll continue the help
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0245141_0245441	then we still have some questions
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0156473_0156654	evolutionary yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0107692_0108376	but then again there would be this just pretty much in a normal office for all the people who don't even know even know what a wheelchair is
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0254638_0255073	oh i think i'm going to make our final presentation now
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0042516_0042770	okay
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0157309_0157416	there are
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0099412_0099634	and we needta hurry
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0041216_0041353	so
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0101088_0101291	okay
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0170437_0170685	very
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0087126_0087445	there it is
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0138886_0139061	and i'm growing with the university
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0149761_0149882	it's a good one
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0122725_0123125	you could take two buttons out of that
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0041453_0041860	so for the marriage we've just been for a couple of years
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0216688_0217321	or in the air full or sheared hair
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0019412_0019547	and the company low
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0072807_0073166	three i think they tried
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0128498_0128621	so there's five buttons
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0057837_0058157	that saves us one year already
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0106163_0106420	but if you push the teddy bear button twice
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0137087_0137451	oh these changes are not really okay with me
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0138097_0138255	well i don't know just go to the board and
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0092155_0092604	and we have five and one
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0133891_0134149	slipper girl this is really easy to just feel it
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0176988_0177147	we have found of that one
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0010136_0010431	we will have the prototype first
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0059955_0060170	it's just one umbrella
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0075542_0075799	so it's not even taking to the prince
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0141234_0141583	it will be necessary to have a good function as well
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0171691_0172030	should be doing
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0181412_0181585	two two flaky
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0180749_0180961	we have the test it's
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0209665_0209854	or were they too much
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0170510_0170929	think so with our e l c d scuba scuba scuba
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0041294_0041399	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0222160_0222383	if we found new ones for
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0210912_0211061	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0106964_0107498	well that could be just the school to the eight school
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0117002_0117143	it's pretty vicious
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0082453_0083439	encourage that all the people to spend their money easier maybe it's feasible to just put the price of the remote up a little bit
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0015791_0016318	well this is what me and firstnamer come up with
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0002296_0002471	afternoon
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0020108_0020509	and we'll hafta see from testing how the useta take it
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0139563_0139867	but i think we can then keep the single girl well
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0181518_0182034	it think a radio button is not exactly what older people expect of a remote control
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0095217_0095416	stroke
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0174438_0174714	do you have all the questions that we wanted to include
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0101291_0101674	and we can say a year by a flat design
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0024492_0025251	but you can also use the the jelly
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0037009_0037127	that's what i pointed out earlier
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0187547_0187762	it was also sposta calculate the score but
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0061278_0061447	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0012941_0013106	but they'll see that later
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0114266_0114455	unhunh
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0021375_0021603	just open at any time
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0090720_0090859	oh no remote
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0071360_0072110	maybe it is but then it seems to me that it's impossible to get the twelve and a half years
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0217452_0217617	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0029738_0029857	if you look at it
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0219973_0220141	yeah but it's here on the table
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0078998_0079213	yeah that's what i'm working on
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0205510_0205664	leisure
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0084758_0084993	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0055958_0056074	yeah with a little bit
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0215998_0216302	it's easier to share it with other people
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0091895_0092155	because then we say ten buttons
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0214235_0214403	follows her well i think
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0176983_0177301	there's
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0036137_0036278	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0244031_0244644	from the end of the oh i think i have one
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0233005_0233184	the dog is barking
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0179974_0180138	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0136204_0136368	what do you think
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0060512_0060809	one two for one big umbrella
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0130525_0130706	yeah yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0231500_0231842	then that's we get to our last crew
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0027039_0028033	but i saw in a few meetings earlier we
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0033476_0034076	or you can build in when you press one button yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0087708_0088326	so fancy and good yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0157416_0157698	if you
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0147923_0148245	but they know the scroll button from old route
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0168331_0168504	so
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0061440_0061761	yeah but it's not stayed in this
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0225098_0225564	so just at the university
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0095416_0095856	if you squiggle you will see the numbers on the ll cl display
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0067056_0067164	and this
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0240492_0240596	just as a test
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0236002_0236226	but i think we will
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0180917_0181412	still i think it's two two fancy
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0191332_0191499	so that would be mine's eight eight
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0091753_0091862	slowly this one
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0106891_0107180	one one but a few breads
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0153182_0153385	now i didn't
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0071170_0071360	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0208923_0209034	tooth toothbrush
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0019006_0019210	one a button for the
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0222026_0222160	it's nice
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0145362_0145959	but this is not really like for the group we were making or remote
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0195745_0195915	hmhm
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0188192_0188302	we've got a couple
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0115761_0115936	and i would put the
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0209363_0209665	were the means sufficient for the tasks that we hadta do
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0103324_0103643	or we hafta skip the supplement but
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0171189_0171295	uhhuh
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0155185_0155519	we still have fifty minutes left so our nice little schedule
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0078439_0078909	but would it make the remote more useful for elementary people
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0203274_0203420	younger users also
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0106899_0107035	that's not really nice
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0039712_0039870	just to recap it so
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0083439_0083715	especially since we have those nice feet
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0175287_0175410	think it's seven
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0100679_0101041	if you want to use an o t c t you you need it at the same time
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0225682_0225853	so everybody puts his own score
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0236631_0236796	especially in america
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0161905_0162137	but new functions are there
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0133430_0133891	it's it's more the balls in which they are being made i think
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0219371_0219673	so the sharing of information was okay
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0036581_0036775	so it's sort of basic already
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0053124_0053846	because we will hafta get the twelve and a half years at the end
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0244396_0244498	abracadabra
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0098570_0098725	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0175844_0175990	oh and do you
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0104376_0104780	can we introduce the table and the subjects and one button
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0236796_0236996	people are pretty
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0101994_0102510	that's an operation we can then we're almost there
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0235657_0235767	forty gr
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0094314_0094454	then he will
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0085521_0085913	if you leave out the ol cl dl dl dl
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0199341_0199442	in the disguise
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0202394_0202519	the room was yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0014580_0015059	we'll do the this kind of type of presentation
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0112092_0112275	because it saves a lot of money
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0017279_0017651	slipper slipper mine's but
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0037877_0038300	so you had somebody but you know something about the design of the buttons there
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0183365_0183543	then we have to do this three
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0186250_0186526	so i think it's very recognizable
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0255148_0255515	yeah yeah you're sposta make a final
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0189978_0190159	and forty nine
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0145138_0145487	it's pretty different if you saw the last one and this one
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0238244_0238405	so maybe we're just refocus
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0034841_0035336	so they just put in the prince the bed and
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0076670_0076864	it's something
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0167419_0167947	yeah that's because my pen failed to open his date
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0197803_0197969	forty percent
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0065854_0066283	looks a bit like
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0096800_0097289	okay but then you you can push some other business as well
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0125980_0126440	so we make one for the chimney
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0087771_0087876	but then
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0157698_0157938	go ahead
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0226629_0226773	so it's
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0068738_0069393	you got not not another better better on the
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0201636_0201997	oh no
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0070476_0070612	but no but i think
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0164162_0164617	is the remote really for the group we're making it for
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0212384_0212719	smart words was irritating
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0156026_0156394	so i set up all these criteria
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0240596_0240780	see how it works
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0030651_0030827	you can't drop that one
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0177776_0177905	oh
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0218219_0218571	can you expand it yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0017651_0017832	we fought a battle
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0185820_0186250	and we have the revenue from sales
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0086475_0086769	but you
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0234586_0235053	so i think that should be the biggest problem because it's very cheap to make as well
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0209950_0210414	well the the drawing is just a pain in the ass but
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0056577_0056973	descarted the help and the mute button
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0057092_0057577	by pressing down a button or pressing down an number
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0104980_0105892	well i think it's pretty much the total text subject go to page eight eight and tell you this description
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0192588_0192723	around eighty percent
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0174271_0174438	it's the design functional
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0138928_0139228	or do some market research and see what the opinions are
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0093820_0094017	but how would the school wheel work here
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0051288_0051551	it's the cheapest one we need
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0015059_0015536	so if somebody wants to stay for it
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0213663_0213862	or something else
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0072386_0072531	and that's that's a big course
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0189335_0189567	these are seven factors time seven and seven it's forty
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0016630_0016914	the mute button just below that
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0129190_0129350	and make it small over
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0243200_0243641	we still hafta fill in one more question
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0039817_0039922	just for recreation
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0179851_0180014	and i think that's a free
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0034076_0034258	but yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0063046_0063189	that's a possibility as well
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0190699_0190964	one of those three was four
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0005570_0005801	okay it's our last meeting
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0137707_0137976	we hafta get
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0155070_0155185	and i can sit down and think
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0201139_0201327	slipper
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0007073_0007473	and then we're going to close the project today as well
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0162952_0163317	or they're not too many functions a month of fun
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0147566_0147692	but i think
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0061761_0062582	so maybe we can even make one button with the phone and the channel in one by pressing
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0128575_0129190	if we leave out those buttons perhaps you can go with the flat flat case
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0073167_0073589	if we leave out the display we can also save money on the chip
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0257455_0257867	and then i meet you in i think about ten minutes or something
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0179881_0180054	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0128359_0128484	it's it's better
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0176676_0176833	it getting lost and
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0139867_0140423	just to exercise a little bit more
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0183543_0183656	it's a
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0103078_0103221	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0192857_0193134	because i just tied that in on the bottom here
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0180097_0180496	now i think with our new radio button i think it's
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0006236_0007073	and we will do some evaluation about the not only the progress but also the progress
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0188962_0189100	and gonna go to her other room again
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0146718_0146881	but
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0153998_0154163	now
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0245441_0245777	but somebody has some questions they can ask him now
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0256421_0256688	are we sposta go into our rooms again
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0132737_0133154	just you only hafta pay for the double core or single core
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0136474_0136803	well i still think we should go for the single course design
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0188530_0188806	shaving it
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0232568_0233023	considering we are not going to make a cooking station
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0190245_0190356	one mine's one
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0202986_0203157	and i would've liked to go for the
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0100440_0100541	has to be at once
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0069893_0070476	but i think because we have the above ship we can just count this as one but then
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0058157_0058347	just then we've gone fifty
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0208114_0208687	the dogs are very strict so you can do step by step and it's very easy
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0088438_0088709	with with
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0026233_0026456	okay
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0142386_0142553	so there's a girl
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0036894_0037009	thank you
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0216302_0216688	so you can save it and put it on the internet
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0086308_0086824	okay okay take the single chip
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0075679_0075858	it's extra
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0154128_0154590	but we can go on with the progress evaluation
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0258363_0258676	hopefully my pen will down low this so far
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0112622_0112798	how to use the scroll wheel
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0158406_0158595	oh we've got fifty minutes but
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0032295_0033198	oh i think the whole button really is necessary because there's no other way to know what a button does
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0144694_0144852	oh i'm glad we could make a bit
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0022694_0023520	that's just the normal as as the normal routine so
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0148554_0148713	that's right
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0069279_0069434	on the chip there
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0170685_0170912	slipper slippers but
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0206916_0207281	oh so you two of you with the last face
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0160970_0161347	congratulated it into two categories which would be these
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0060809_0061278	but they are more expensive than the small ones
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0002765_0002891	got stuck in the tree
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0196020_0196171	so they were able to be in the environment
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0233323_0233942	but maybe because of the documentation the price of the resort can also be a little bit higher
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0213865_0214034	the slipper's easier so
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0217729_0218117	now you need the smart board application i think
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0085913_0086188	and if you use less butter
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0083822_0084216	yeah but we hafta stick to the twelve and a half hours
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0173037_0173279	and i would say four
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0040356_0041216	yeah some remote control do so but yeah because we use the little display we don't hafta use it
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0148690_0148848	so maybe it's
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0129520_0130493	so if he put the the umbrella and child buttons on the same right side then the corner button
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0138490_0138782	to spend eighteen dollars a room
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0019210_0019412	but in for the subjects
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0131332_0131599	decides this one to for business
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0011851_0012264	because everything goes money and the more finances you wanna have the more money it's gonna cost
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0244644_0244766	five more minutes
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0153385_0153583	alright course in the twelve and a half years
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0069429_0069825	well the slipper you got still for that's right for a bit
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0201327_0201462	wasn't the room for creativity
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0158226_0158339	five more minutes
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0210871_0211227	if it wants to download this date
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0236421_0236631	it's innovative
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0088932_0089083	contract or agreement
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0013797_0014313	so we will be finished at three
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0074986_0075402	the the dancing station isn't even in the scope
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0252721_0252875	maybe they'll be safe
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0140423_0141234	so people will use it more and especially for the help functions that they'll be good if we have a scroll button
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0119725_0120301	one two three four five buttons if we race this one
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0179499_0179698	does the design fit the group of four
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0113870_0114054	if you would've read these
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0104203_0104445	but it's
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0035930_0036107	leave out the number buttons i guess
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0096146_0096447	that would bring up the price of the school wheel also
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0215007_0215998	but if you wanna share of when you make a a picture like this on the presentation
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0030000_0030312	most controls they've got more buttons than this
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0152952_0153182	but i would buy if i was six
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0029107_0029558	if we really really need all of those
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0043583_0044103	which is pretty exciting to see if it's all possible what we wanna do
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0243778_0243907	and i didn't get a message
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0046449_0046571	four i don't know if it's possible
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0119110_0119389	it's something like that
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0218259_0218463	but i think you can yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0097381_0097608	you could just not crawl for a whole second
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0084565_0084675	it's a little too
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0229875_0230035	questions about the progress
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0217264_0217573	yeah i try to open the file on my laptop but
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0152730_0152944	but you're not sixty
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0221256_0221553	yeah yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0063208_0063402	they would cut the cross
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0238517_0238789	just put it on the market for everybody
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0255238_0255994	and then i will be back in about ten minutes to show you the fine presentation
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0042530_0042672	and that's about it
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0079853_0080323	we're gonna buy a remote control when you can use it
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0076864_0077108	putty
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0008951_0009616	the university
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0173214_0173379	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0184583_0184737	yes it is
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0205664_0206292	was it clear what everybody hadta do according to their roles and functions
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0094817_0094956	maybe
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0034430_0034841	but all people don't know that operation
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0023626_0024092	you you came in a page one hundred
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0176201_0176676	take care of the big operations of the remote control
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0145232_0145362	it's pretty different
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0240780_0240960	that's i think a good answer
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0199522_0199792	so a little bit of information about prices
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0149057_0149480	old old butts
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0058928_0059435	and i assume you count the phone and central thing's for two buttons each right
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0157938_0158406	you've got five minutes i think for this category
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0089624_0089850	but i think it's difficult as well but
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0237812_0237923	you can do more
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0151436_0151580	it might be confusing too
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0218463_0218606	should be possible
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0123989_0124160	so that would say two buttons
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0091765_0091992	that's
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0102611_0102942	yeah if you could just leave out one more button
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0106706_0107015	two hundred eighteen
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0009616_0010053	in order to do that we have this adventure
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0235206_0235536	do we think we gonna get the twelve and a half million
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0205333_0205510	okay
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0240919_0241758	yeah i think it then it would be way more popular with younger people than it is with older people
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0058479_0058604	wouldn't yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0007473_0008027	so after that you'll be free to go and spend all your money
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0200381_0200484	oh
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0152156_0152341	but it's very special so
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0124384_0124704	that's really a good good idea i think
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0198676_0199145	we should've had the finance thing earlier
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0135571_0136204	well does everybody think about the flight or a single course decide
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0033873_0034008	long time
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0048674_0049330	we can see that the difference between underground and the sky above is one year
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0046093_0046275	and i counted two berries
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0149952_0150380	so i'm afraid we hafta move on
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0096574_0096836	okay great school will push you
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0172030_0172181	it's the design easy to use
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0082155_0082340	well since the market research
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0113317_0113870	and it's good for the innovative design as well
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0157564_0157736	thank you
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0152495_0152752	and i would buy it
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0077625_0078335	and incorporate these buttons in three then we save a lot of money as well
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0128278_0128384	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0237264_0237626	yeah i mean if we're gonna make a scroll button anyway
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0097811_0098288	so if you scroll through number and you wait a whole second then it turns to that chapter
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0242163_0242325	even if it were their covers
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0182037_0182151	yeah two
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0131765_0131884	alright now we're fine
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0137451_0137601	but since
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0257026_0257455	and i think you will get a question in in your room
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0226438_0226629	that's better
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0148245_0148690	and they all of a sudden business like that for changing a job
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0003189_0003551	it's possible and this time of day
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0085527_0085761	it would be a pretty quick one
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0191635_0191834	forty one
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0188913_0189159	we're gonna we're going to evaluate it
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0084216_0084758	we don't have any more business to develop it
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0171295_0171763	so we've got twenty cents for our cooking station
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0002471_0002765	so i'm a little late
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0020734_0021337	it's this the moment where we ask questions about the university
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0056416_0056577	seventy
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0172971_0173113	for all the people i i
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0169452_0169635	we'll go for six
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0104986_0105181	if you push it three times
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0097669_0097773	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0058567_0058729	five things bits
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0173279_0173431	four or five between
