AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0019663_0019800	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0121416_0121534	yeah we're gonna make a new one
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0035713_0035849	yeah we're not even in here now
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0187312_0187486	one of them anyway
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0085470_0085653	yeah that's what we need uh
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0128003_0128125	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0002779_0002990	yeah that's true
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0159403_0159664	we can decide on that later i guess
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0150042_0150192	oh you see
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0147125_0147573	well
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0099998_0100130	um i don't know
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0183644_0183749	that's cool
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0104146_0104463	so even if you can make it yellow or whatever we don't really have to decide on that
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0208960_0209241	but most people will want to pay for the l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0064139_0064653	you take out the l. c. d. screen and you make it a regular remote control
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0031789_0031923	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0114347_0114848	and maybe we can discuss it in our in our next meeting or something
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0001232_0001522	so what do we need to talk about
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0032731_0033237	we don't want we don't want the l. c. d. screen because it's not very expensive or something
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0063079_0063650	very little time left to work out all the details of what we're actually going to produce and everything like that
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0117355_0118027	well it's well but let's see what the numbers are
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0018003_0018170	that's a good point
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0089197_0089641	so the l. c. d. screen is a good example of the technology that's out there
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0161524_0161669	the whole thing won't be a problem
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0047814_0048253	so if you have the l. c. d. display then it's a little bit of a problem
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0066991_0067105	the l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0046605_0046933	well it's still come up to my expectations though
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0150408_0150546	okay
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0127448_0127916	okay
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0207817_0207928	oh
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0069723_0070329	yeah changing the channels from zero to nine is a total of four times
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0193221_0193326	yeah some of the l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0093398_0093531	okay yeah you're right
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0193805_0193935	to end it
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0175999_0176266	maybe you should make it a sticker
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0059290_0059432	oh no
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0002820_0003016	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0186866_0187030	what a man
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0175667_0176204	let's let's go for a special colour
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0029777_0029908	yeah that's true yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0199994_0200131	the real okay
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0166778_0167381	the production price is twelve and a half euros
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0125645_0125768	that's probably a problem
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0160782_0161336	yeah well the l. c. d. screen you know it's a little bit expensive to build in
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0044106_0044434	so it's a little bit like the colour of the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0193562_0193757	what gives us the energy and what does it cost
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0087802_0087921	about the price of a t. v.
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0143627_0144045	yeah come on take out one euro and make it a double r. okay
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0058505_0058736	um you can't lose it somewhere else i suppose
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0005142_0005935	um we took out the advanced chip which came with with the basic remote control because it was too expensive
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0196589_0196765	so what do you say it's time
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0048635_0049016	yeah but then the problem is that there's a lot of money left on the budget
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0116852_0117355	oh i didn't have anything else to add just a little bit more speech recognition
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0192791_0192913	you have to do it every day
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0203466_0203610	yeah i think
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0086888_0087101	so that's what we need to get into i guess
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0140326_0140557	so you don't need any more than what you just said anyway
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0077098_0077878	the l. c. d. display we have some problems with the l. c. d. display and all those kind of issues
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0099449_0099697	can i tell you what i have to do next
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0190013_0190197	or three or a two
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0067707_0067992	oh you should be able to
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0038530_0038786	like a fruit for example here with the three r. c. yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0075205_0075352	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0022916_0023124	it's just more yeah that's a risk to take
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0103624_0103767	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0206079_0206202	you can have it
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0136115_0136646	you just said that in the in the notes you didn't stick it down so fast
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0187767_0188059	you know like in the one and a half euros budget
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0022415_0022683	it's more what you can do with our l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0189678_0189903	oh but but we have the l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0049016_0049385	and you know what people put in their remote control because they lost it
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0085882_0086008	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0084417_0084676	it's not a lot of it's not a lot of money
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0000540_0000872	oh that's a little bit
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0188099_0188231	triple r. c.
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0072576_0072925	you have to change all the t. v. s
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0099650_0099878	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0096253_0096476	the end of the project
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0075637_0075770	yeah you can manage it
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0132517_0132635	and then yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0084151_0084417	um pretty much everything is going to be in my report
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0174020_0174401	the l. c. d. is impossible
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0166387_0166559	um
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0173753_0173939	that's not difficult
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0146177_0146599	well the top of it has to be a little bit spongy
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0016434_0016638	we could put it on a curve right
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0109961_0110119	okay
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0068028_0068145	um sorry
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0099664_0099913	oh right
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0160316_0160588	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0183594_0183865	let's save this one
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0101489_0101940	like in the in the old fashion remote control you have the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0127277_0127378	oh
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0199647_0200193	oh maybe it should be spongy because we can't see the l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0212007_0212165	oh
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0206263_0206578	if there's another one i don't know
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0066473_0066660	so just one curve like that i think
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0004829_0004932	okay
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0022508_0022651	is it more expensive than uh
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0146201_0146304	uh-huh
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0184062_0184390	oh yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0147251_0147568	uh-huh
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0131951_0132084	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0202399_0202522	it's a little bit of both really
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0117803_0118064	well
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0162239_0162386	so the only problem is
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0095076_0095254	oh fifty five euro twenty five
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0196080_0196423	oh i couldn't put it in my email
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0131325_0132073	yeah so if you take out the l. c. d. display then you lose a little bit of the special colour yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0120585_0120701	yeah that's fine
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0057088_0057255	but not at the moment
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0178441_0178929	and then we'd lose the speech recognition which is an extra feature that we couldn't make
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0014755_0015291	but if you have a lot of buttons like that then it's kind of a bit of a waste of space i think
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0118821_0118966	yeah that's right
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0002707_0002820	doesn't sell so much
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0061802_0062025	that's what i had in fact
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0067517_0067620	let's do that anyway then
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0056175_0056388	yeah the channel selection and the volume
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0145209_0145714	that's basically the same thing that we talked about in the last meeting anyway
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0158434_0159102	maybe we'll just go on a little extra and put the l. c. d. display on the top of the remote control instead of the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0051484_0051863	oh it's a triple r. s triple r. r. c.
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0115338_0115519	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0082966_0083521	and it just doesn't make any sense if you're in a dark room
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0105376_0105513	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0082025_0082238	what kind of product would people really pay for
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0073445_0073665	and you go away and work on it for a couple of hours or whatever
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0115829_0115980	maybe we should stick with an l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0059679_0060216	yeah okay it would be nice to have the l. c. d. display on the remote control itself
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0019685_0019789	if you just yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0082427_0082876	okay i'm just gonna look into the menu and see if there's anything you can do with it
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0201020_0201252	but i think all the colours i like but
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0128090_0128300	but now you could have a black no
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0019485_0019663	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0129792_0130668	it's a double r. c. it's not a single r. c. but you have to take out the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0130698_0131380	it's just a little bit of extra for when you have that kind of product and it's not like this one where it's flat all the time
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0209873_0210490	okay the second point is you want to develop a speech recognition system on the l. c. d. display
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0189903_0190011	what what was your f uh
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0192373_0192682	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0169920_0170266	just lost my laptop again
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0149292_0149397	oh
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0209487_0209690	oh yeah that was that was the end of it
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0127378_0127795	let's see what the most difficult part is
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0109386_0109613	okay
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0081037_0081143	oh
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0115519_0115636	oh we shouldn't do that
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0155035_0155705	well i don't know why you're not talking about the banana
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0149932_0150211	you do
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0083521_0083648	do we want any more on it
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0095493_0095832	um and then there's an l. c. d. display
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0068145_0068259	or do you think we should just
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0002147_0002311	it's not a lion
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0056580_0057088	maybe we need to do a little more research on the if it's not too expensive for the production
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0037629_0037844	is it just from the menu that we're in
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0116848_0117033	yeah exactly exactly
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0120083_0120184	let's see you
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0104872_0105003	smaller than the l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0035475_0035713	yeah that's that's a lot of money if you need them
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0192242_0192775	we can go on to the next uh look
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0109230_0110041	so i'm gonna have to put a little bit more effort into the design of the remote control because it has to fit in your hand
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0211382_0211679	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0137664_0137928	did you did you read that it had to do with the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0015291_0015579	yeah i mean if you lose something like that
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0097001_0097137	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0049626_0050203	but do you don't think it's better to stick with an l. c. d. display on top of it
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0096861_0096996	it's just pure colour
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0116842_0116961	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0199278_0199452	maybe it doesn't have a name
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0088004_0088628	well i mean that's not really important but if we had to make it a little bit different
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0097408_0097519	still got a few hours left
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0083778_0083904	um
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0174256_0174363	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0050456_0050574	it's just something you have to deal with
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0113394_0114347	um yeah i think that's a good idea because if you look at the market um what people like and what they don't
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0212592_0212738	okay
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0170294_0170594	yeah that's a problem
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0098772_0098929	just talk about some of the other ones
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0119940_0120083	oh no
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0085653_0085983	just something that's a little more standard in the market
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0160605_0160782	couldn't happen better
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0136646_0136971	to have to find out how long it's supposed to be finished by the way
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0183976_0184292	in the middle
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0122509_0122961	oh no but the l. c. d. is uh you use it as well
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0032239_0032507	but the l. c. d. screen makes it a little bit more expensive
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0146004_0146201	uh-huh
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0091941_0092409	they don't they don't really need the n the normal buttons for example
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0014258_0014411	can you double click on it
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0088721_0088976	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0184576_0184735	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0212600_0212704	it's on the side anyway
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0077312_0077525	yeah they're doing the same thing every day in their work
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0204224_0204578	yeah we'll yeah we'll put the numbers in it probably
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0129035_0129151	okay
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0091452_0091735	if you don't have a lot of money left i don't have to make it red anyway
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0066792_0066942	that's a nice point
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0176204_0176314	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0186513_0186630	um yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0187051_0187192	yeah that's nice man
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0092409_0092544	you can send them to me but
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0181391_0181684	just like the l. c. d. screen exactly
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0088628_0088867	so i'll have a look
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0047355_0047814	if you have like a double curve in the middle you don't have a single curve in the middle
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0151060_0151220	you have some time now huh
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0019845_0020242	so just have to make sure it's not too small for the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0103977_0104086	alright
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0137932_0138302	yeah just for speech recognition
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0116472_0116734	uh
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0039120_0039859	because you wanna take out all the buttons and put it on a single remote control which looks like this one
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0137198_0137323	oh oh okay
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0141071_0141221	oh yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0107249_0107771	exactly the same thing that we took into account in the last meeting to design the look and feel
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0211713_0211898	okay think we need to take out the l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0036132_0036419	we have to find out what exactly what you had in mind with the l. c. d. display
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0114890_0115025	should be possible to share
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0200193_0200308	it's next week thirty minutes
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0036443_0036813	we have the special colour we have the special form but we don't have to keep that in mind
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0096603_0096861	maybe you have to look into it i don't know
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0067488_0067598	oh you don't see it
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0117565_0117771	these are all twelve and a half
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0063271_0063546	yeah but maybe two or a three
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0061525_0062063	yeah i think we need to do that before we have the final look at the product anyway
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0150288_0150408	can this be changed
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0204578_0204860	let's close
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0132084_0132683	yeah yeah that's a good idea you can just put the l. c. d. display on the yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0067089_0067346	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0018189_0018372	oh
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0067093_0067298	yeah yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0005935_0006681	and then you get a menu on the l. c. d. screen which allows you to select one of your options
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0202392_0202622	okay
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0209577_0209692	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0092251_0092382	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0153025_0153272	is that an advanced chip
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0101288_0101585	yeah yeah a small issue
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0094325_0094677	oh five and a half
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0068785_0069057	there's a problem with the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0054629_0054823	yeah you're working on it
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0118367_0118669	yeah that's just a little bit of the black in the middle
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0054942_0055367	um yeah another thing
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0030633_0030899	take out the speech recognition and menu button
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0035849_0036132	you don't even need a special colour on the on the product because it's pink
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0093953_0094325	oh no
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0067992_0068134	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0078405_0078674	yeah you want to do that with the same design
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0043260_0043622	okay that could have been a lot more expensive than ten and a half
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0190345_0190549	and the speech recognition maybe not
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0050347_0050518	well i don't know
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0119388_0119603	which is probably a little bit confusing if you're watching t. v.
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0121856_0122358	yeah you can still work on that in the next thirty minutes or something like that
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0071903_0072556	so you could just like a normal pen but it would be nice to have this kind of trendy look on it
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0074777_0074938	you do yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0152802_0153029	but it's in ten and a half
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0052354_0053059	yeah but i don't i don't think there's a l. c. d. display on it
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0161669_0161948	um we can just do the same thing like we did last time
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0146751_0146953	that doesn't have anything to do with me i think
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0115980_0116747	we may maybe we don't need an l. c. d. screen anyway when you see what i mean
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0191580_0192089	the l. c. d. screen you can put this in here if the menu is on the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0050717_0050901	it's got to come out
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0172494_0172917	was it not like what you had we didn't have a playstation thing
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0164731_0165115	yeah well keep in mind it's basically a double curve
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0163891_0164297	let's see i think we should just stick to the l. c. d. information as much as possible
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0175200_0175308	okay
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0141020_0141277	okay
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0068026_0068178	but but
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0029782_0030242	uh the only thing we didn't really talk about here is the speech recognition part
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0011582_0012313	or you can add a special colour for the l. c. d. display and an extra button that's not part of the original design
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0182306_0182820	take out a two and a half point to save time
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0147120_0147459	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0202522_0202670	they didn't really get an email on that
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0167535_0167757	so let's say that's three
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0199514_0199666	so let's see
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0143975_0144143	exactly
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0023804_0024042	but i think we're not talking about a lot of money anyway
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0002801_0003073	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0176358_0176565	it could be a little bit more difficult
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0056935_0057122	oh yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0000361_0000468	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0023492_0023804	what's a little more than twenty five euros i think
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0168904_0169056	okay so
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0023440_0023676	maybe maybe
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0103473_0103608	yeah i could have had it like that
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0165115_0165239	like you say yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0192089_0192700	or you can if we lose all the money we'll have to find a way around that
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0150546_0150752	um i don't have any more data
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0066942_0067089	oh a little tip
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0030336_0030633	yeah that might be a little bit too much like you said in the last meeting
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0042816_0043260	if you take out the l. c. d. screen do we still have to give up on the on the double curve
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0057255_0057500	but but
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0031139_0031547	but how are we doing with the little bit of extra time we have left
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0015579_0016074	so you can make the l. c. d. screen on top of the remote if that's your preference
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0069694_0069876	yeah but that might not be in the uh
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0142648_0142769	exactly
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0117533_0118031	yeah but yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0150022_0150349	oh no
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0064834_0065636	well i don't think you can have a multi function remote control with the l. c. d. display because it's a little bit of a problem
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0001521_0002417	well let's just go ahead and see what we can do with the money we have left over
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0124483_0124642	so when it's a one
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0103286_0103406	oh a pen
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0156712_0157002	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0089641_0090010	like you can just like we could do a special colour for the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0101383_0101731	oh yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0142167_0142569	and i don't have to tell you that i had a lot of trouble doing it in the first place
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0186612_0186822	maybe it's a menu button or something
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0073095_0073445	if you have a lot of space for the l. c. d. display that's pretty cool
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0064862_0064969	we'll think of that later i suppose
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0168794_0168904	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0002417_0002522	oh i see
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0133778_0134161	so it's just for those extra ones which are still under twelve and a half
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0191393_0191513	yeah that's from what
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0103097_0103239	well that's pretty much their product
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0066465_0066707	oh i think it's a total disaster
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0090334_0090526	otherwise you can't use an l. c. d. on it
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0048370_0048684	okay so like for instance the speech recognition
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0128800_0129035	so how are you then
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0050901_0051245	it's not it's not the only one out there
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0208880_0209062	smaller than a p. c.
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0038786_0039120	yeah that's the top selling thing on the market right now
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0201252_0201545	so there's not a lot of money in it
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0207928_0208146	the one with the top on it
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0133367_0133778	and the whole thing is orange and pink or something that you don't see
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0073967_0074082	well i don't like it
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0185690_0185974	so yeah so i think that's exactly what you're looking for
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0192975_0193087	okay
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0132390_0132517	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0018170_0018296	oh no
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0171814_0172395	and then you can use it on your t. v. if you want to watch a movie that's not in my d. v. d. library
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0079370_0079997	maybe like a triple r. c. s triple r. c. s with two different colours on it or something like that
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0157652_0158052	do we need a push button to make one euro fifty
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0051763_0052198	well i'll just take out the camera and do it on my own
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0112504_0113049	so i mean it's a little bit more expensive than the
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0174055_0174256	yeah that's quite expensive
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0177789_0177962	that's on the end of our design i suppose
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0108343_0108907	maybe it's better to take out the speech recognition and write something down
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0213503_0213747	oh
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0153425_0153739	okay like like a double r. c.
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0032138_0032239	but don't know that
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0067699_0067902	don't i don't think that's really easy to do either
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0210621_0210766	banana is perfect
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0194037_0194480	yeah okay it's good to go for a double curve but it's just gonna be a little bit more expensive in the end
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0160177_0160605	yeah and so why not
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0090504_0090785	maybe you can make it a little bit more clear in the in the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0196431_0196575	well i think the company name
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0201901_0202026	um something like
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0105058_0105219	but that's basically the idea okay
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0142505_0142623	yeah right
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0177317_0177653	we want to be original we want to stay under the budget
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0053232_0053373	if you can think of something else maybe
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0028511_0029029	um i mean it's not like uh a lot of people
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0140885_0141114	have you updated your excel sheet
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0075888_0076047	okay well that's alright
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0087094_0087314	well that's exactly what i mean it doesn't make any sense
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0163096_0163352	sample sensor and triple r. c.
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0016268_0016434	um we don't have a special colour on it
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0017064_0017669	so you can click on a menu and select a colour or a line width or a background colour or something like that
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0120427_0120774	yeah but you have a pen
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0211914_0212391	if you have any uh knowledge about it
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0020464_0020661	oh just the menu button or
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0119772_0119940	that's a little bit of problem
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0111940_0112175	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0035495_0035633	and in that way i don't know
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0195055_0195472	yeah it's a curve on the top and a curve on the yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0013662_0014263	that's like the one that you have here with the plastic cover and the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0188355_0188627	oh it's triple r. c.
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0022303_0022415	oh yeah well
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0135749_0136115	um well it's in the colour um
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0151914_0152324	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0041128_0042077	so basically we have a menu structure which is based on the l. c. d. display and some additional buttons for example
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0127599_0127915	oh it doesn't look like a curve at all
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0087314_0087615	just stick it on top to take out the speech recognition
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0207601_0208075	you can read that
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0016638_0016875	we could have put a logo on the front for example
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0093261_0093398	could you just make it a two then
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0090010_0090601	like if we just take like i think it's a good idea to put on top of our remote control something like
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0117886_0118016	oh the last one
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0196807_0196960	just think it's better to do the extra work
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0142769_0142891	yes
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0099194_0099473	channel up channel down
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0023119_0023309	oh well but we can't buy it by the way
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0074042_0074793	maybe when you lose the l. c. d. display we use a normal one but when you lose the l. c. d. display we use a normal one
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0080687_0080793	yes that's okay
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0102255_0102357	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0101792_0102458	but it's just a t. v. remote control if you don't have an l. c. d. display on it
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0102357_0102731	so i think that's just a little bit of curve could be used to keep the product looking pretty
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0173610_0173763	oh okay
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0093919_0094050	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0096372_0096633	yes i'm familiar with them
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0117033_0117172	so you're still under the
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0030899_0031139	just to some extra information on the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0188886_0189228	and you have to do that on the l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0202026_0202188	one curve i think is a good curve
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0186274_0186440	take a pen
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0050901_0051126	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0153272_0153425	oh
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0195537_0195672	could have done it better huh
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0019281_0019509	yeah so yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0086536_0086642	yeah definitely
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0213148_0213262	should we turn that off then
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0002787_0003057	okay
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0061410_0061622	do you think they like it or they don't
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0171085_0171814	maybe you should write down a little summary of what you did pretty much for the design phase
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0094000_0094135	okay your name
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0157002_0157469	oh no we don't have to decide on that because it's always the same thing
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0097137_0097408	um i'm actually not sure if you all agree
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0204721_0204855	okay
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0156411_0156771	oh have you got an excel sheet by the way
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0156158_0156528	oh yeah me too
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0021828_0022161	well you know the menu button maybe the s the scroll button
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0103281_0103473	yeah well i don't know if it's possible
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0026438_0026635	is that gonna be a little too much
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0118578_0118835	well yeah you'll pay extra for the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0018136_0018302	oh
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0067627_0067774	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0036739_0036844	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0081658_0082025	and the final product is pretty straight forward
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0190197_0190345	yeah just oh
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0182497_0182770	or like like the black and yellow or something like that
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0192972_0193082	it's got a lot of colour on it
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0103100_0103274	you can have some fruit on it
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0003057_0003385	well i got a push button as well
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0206959_0207489	um i guess the consensus is that we should have the l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0057083_0057836	we want to make one that you can use with both your l. c. d. and the menu buttons so that you don't lose them
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0045256_0045466	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0186440_0186706	oh no i didn't know what you mean either
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0142891_0143171	so they're all in the same colour then
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0111440_0111661	yeah i'm uh sorry to you
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0036813_0037031	but i don't think so
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0049470_0049688	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0142482_0142647	it's just a little too expensive
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0091362_0091506	maybe that might be an idea
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0047821_0048342	oh it's just a little bit more expensive because you have to fill in the colours
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0148033_0148494	um i don't know what i can say about the remote control
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0050686_0050787	yeah exactly
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0181742_0182107	just like you just saw on the l. c. d. screen but it's just a little bit more complicated
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0044434_0044882	what we did in the last meeting is basically what everyone already decided to do
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0196423_0196524	what is my name again
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0055367_0055554	yellow and spongy
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0106854_0107249	oh do we need to make it a little more expensive
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0108907_0109230	and i'm pretty much going to have to agree with you on it anyway
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0152113_0152802	we decided on a lot of things which i don't like because we had only twelve and a half euros left
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0045449_0045889	so we don't have that much more information on the costs of those things so that's something to keep in mind
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0213928_0214081	let's see here
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0190431_0190658	oh yeah three or a two and a one
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0197879_0198035	does it have a logo on the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0064717_0064841	oh i think it's just fine
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0200596_0201020	we have we have like one special colour and one special pen width for example
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0019509_0019685	so that's a bad yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0205523_0205676	was there anything else
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0004091_0004413	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0075352_0075888	and i can't see that you can make a l. c. d. display on it or anything like that
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0197135_0197413	well then we'll have to start over again from the beginning
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0066363_0066473	let's have a little time though
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0195765_0196060	oh that's a half of the fruit i thought it had to be
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0145854_0146061	we still have the ten dollar bill
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0061004_0061410	yeah what did you guys work on in the last couple of minutes before the meeting ended
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0068134_0068297	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0160327_0160522	you can implement the logo
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0029382_0029782	or make a special edition with the m. p. three player and
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0127915_0128090	so that's not a big deal
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0033408_0033513	uh i think we should do that
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0067816_0068028	oh you're right
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0070776_0071251	yeah on top of that there's also a button for your favourite channel and one button for your programme
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0159741_0159994	so um what are you gonna do with the l. c. d. information
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0205048_0205523	um yeah that's it i guess
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0050651_0051022	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0019405_0019811	yeah it might be a good idea to start with just the basic one and then build up from there
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0158298_0158434	well i don't know
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0139668_0140326	if you have the one with the curve that's a nice way to make the remote control look fancy
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0005038_0005142	so yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0057791_0058099	maybe we should just go with the one that's already on the market to be honest
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0067902_0068026	maybe maybe you better
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0052255_0052654	yeah that's a good start
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0128916_0129092	oh this is not the next slide
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0040426_0040582	and it's customisable
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0138539_0139209	so you could just uh you could use that one and then make a new one if you wanted to
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0122358_0122504	come on
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0184390_0184885	well i don't think you can tell from the design anyway
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0124736_0125544	just to get the idea of what you have to go through the process of designing a remote control from start to finish
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0026807_0027289	so maybe you wanna make the l. c. d. display on top of it because that's the menu button
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0148494_0148752	so i'm supposed to make the l. c. d. display
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0014263_0014755	so you can't have that anyway but that's what i had to do with my design
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0001907_0002369	doesn't have anything to do with it
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0044882_0045291	just in the presentation of the project and the end report
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0191260_0191791	well we're gonna take the the the the curve in the curve in the design
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0173365_0173753	that's complicated but that's complicated
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0120774_0121027	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0054234_0054469	it's gonna be the end of it
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0023188_0023463	we don't know much about the finance but we like the idea of one euro left
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0172917_0173184	or is it just like that one
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0159233_0159403	yeah if you like
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0153784_0153900	oh that's uh sorry
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0040278_0040500	and did you have a menu function
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0185631_0185865	yeah i don't think it's gonna take up a lot of space anyway
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0071899_0072058	it's gonna be a problem
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0201698_0201870	just think it was a bad idea i guess
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0022651_0023204	that's a good one
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0102731_0103149	so you just lose the curve in the in the remote control
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0209644_0209866	so i think that's basically what you came up with
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0156771_0157064	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0101685_0101792	yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0086073_0086473	so just the speech recognition and the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0004372_0004550	that's a good thing on this
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0077822_0077961	explanation
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0149880_0150007	oh
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0117363_0117533	yes exactly same
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0003804_0004372	oh well it's my turn again
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0076219_0076581	yeah we can lose the l. c. d. display like this one and just yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0077961_0078225	yeah that was the design part of the project anyway
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0196960_0197135	then we have all the numbers and things
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0006879_0007304	um so i think the l. c. d. screen is a nice option
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0156246_0156562	oh wait a minute this will be open in a second
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0043622_0044106	if you take a double curve on the on the l. c. d. display or something like that it's a little bit of problem
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0068294_0068404	you don't really need it anyway
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0177980_0178441	yeah you could just do something like that to get out of the design phase and then go into the production phase
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0076972_0077180	yeah they're they're different that's true that's true
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0126372_0126907	so you don't they don't say they don't say that they look nice in black or something like that
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0141114_0141347	oh yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0098011_0098236	everybody's ready
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0150349_0150482	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0202348_0202617	yeah yeah with a triple r. c.
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0164782_0164907	we'll go with this anyway
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0090732_0091278	well just if you make the l. c. d. display then we'll just take out the rest of the menu and do it in the l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0017692_0017968	or can we have the l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0182770_0183332	okay just just yeah let's see what you guys can do on your side and then we'll stick to the basic design
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0141861_0142167	that gives us a lot of extra data on the charts
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0058175_0058529	let's see if you make it a little more on the on the trendy side of things
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0188627_0188749	yeah it was on the t. v. anyway
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0056045_0056157	you mean single curved
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0187237_0187767	now it's not only for a t. v. um in your home
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0030163_0030404	it need to be a little bit expensive in order to break the bank
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0200409_0200538	we don't have to deal with the l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0112175_0112406	oh yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0104524_0104872	well maybe we'll sell the remote control to people under forty five
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0012313_0012838	but i think you can lose the l. c. d. screen because it's on top of the advanced chip anyway
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0103608_0104072	but but for a lot of things like um turning it on and off and changing the channel
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0204092_0204431	we'll have the l. c. d. display okay
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0093781_0093953	it's only in the l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0203610_0204092	maybe we'll take out the l. c. d. display for example and just have this
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0082870_0083007	okay
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0039767_0039903	yeah right
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0188093_0188254	okay
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0198860_0199278	yeah let's see what you don't know
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0110041_0110272	but i guess it's not a big deal
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0055863_0056045	we don't we don't need the yellow anyway
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0156044_0156191	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0032507_0032731	uh it's like a nice name
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0062025_0062566	well i mean i'm not sure if we have any more money in our uh budget
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0051364_0051484	yeah you have yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0166146_0166411	well i didn't do much more than you suggested actually
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0040001_0040143	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0155828_0155954	oh
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0075628_0075840	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0058736_0058939	seems to be talking about something all the time
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0000789_0000894	okay okay
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0050661_0051319	you have to paint it as a special colour
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0000358_0000538	yeah exactly yeah exactly
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0202617_0203004	oh the other thing i had the curve in the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0161336_0161524	oh no
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0042077_0042413	and when we lose the kinetic part then we lose the energy
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0040963_0041128	so yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0039955_0040278	so we could do a little design trial and see what that looks like
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0165239_0165581	okay do we want to implement a display for the l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0093469_0093781	well it's not difficult
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0007975_0008475	you have to open up an excel spreadsheet and put all your data into it at the same time
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0091683_0091941	oh no it it's not really a one
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0062635_0063079	well i don't think it's a big problem to sell the whole thing in one colour all the time on the entire world
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0076581_0077006	the display on the front and the display on the t. f. t. which is triple r. s triple r. c.
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0055554_0055657	do you want us to do another one
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0183749_0183976	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0191133_0191290	oh we have the curve again
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0182107_0182452	just a little bit of the kick off just kick off the project
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0024337_0025195	you can have a mute button in the middle
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0106053_0106854	well i thought about a bit more when it was my time for example um what's the best way to build an l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0189157_0189286	yeah that's another option
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0021960_0022078	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0205676_0206048	or do you want to take a l. c. d. screen or something like that
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0028670_0028789	it's an idea
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0079078_0079370	yeah well i d yeah i can do that
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0078674_0078914	the pen size and the number of buttons on it
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0073677_0073785	yeah exactly
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0118966_0119388	and then we have the l. c. d. display which is what we wanted anyway
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0133146_0133367	there's a lot of uh features in this one
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0211427_0211614	alright
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0023928_0024337	well i mean in one in one way it's a basic remote control
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0091705_0091985	but i think they like the fruit anyway
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0165701_0165820	especially a double r. c.
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0150440_0150541	shall i do that again
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0022781_0022916	yeah that's right
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0007304_0007975	and um it looks on the same side as you'd expect from a normal l. c. d. display
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0060216_0060330	the push button will be fine
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0153288_0153740	yeah it's a nice name and uh one of the title yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0213391_0213503	now we're done
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0121271_0121856	yeah i think the l. c. d. screen is pretty standard on most t. v. s out there
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0173910_0174620	oh it's a hippo
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0109252_0109389	okay
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0168279_0168401	yes here
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0024516_0024746	triple r. c.
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0051365_0051759	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0211532_0211708	it's okay
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0024381_0024516	oh no i didn't know
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0170421_0170824	um the end of the second one
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0132635_0133008	because even all of them have l. c. d. s
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0155656_0155807	oh sorry
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0199088_0199348	oh yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0173939_0174331	don't need the hand dynamo
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0092884_0093251	um so the design is totally my own
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0137199_0137656	had to do some research into the had to do some research into the design of the remote control
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0023050_0023188	but it's not an expensive thing
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0093642_0093761	what's your name
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0155364_0155633	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0037844_0038530	if we're looking for something that's a little bit more like what you see on the on the l. c. d. display is it's a one or a two
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0080447_0080587	yeah i can change that
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0036798_0036933	yes
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0027270_0027918	okay so when you lose your remote control and you want to see where it is in the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0069530_0069723	oh i just don't know
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0068460_0068785	it's a bit of a compromise between the triple r. c.
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0175377_0175487	scroll wheel in green
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0111508_0111638	put it in a word document
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0124017_0124283	yeah i think it's quite hard when you're out of course but
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0193279_0193562	let's get started with what we already agreed on i suppose
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0004152_0004342	good idea
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0009603_0010391	okay so we want you know what we wanna put on the on the remote control not a lot of buttons
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0212165_0212502	think
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0063967_0064139	and the sample sensor and the voice recognition
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0010958_0011582	if we take the l. c. d. and the speech recognition then we can only include one in the design
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0076088_0076284	okay but can we use the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0000096_0000665	what's the most expensive part of the thing you have to make out of rubber
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0180527_0180987	so we don't have to do a lot of extra stuff like just filling up the whole thing
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0051319_0051763	oh it's gone
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0145397_0145576	yeah the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0195472_0195877	it's good
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0197331_0197709	yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0179871_0180527	maybe you could write it down so that it's not lost in your notebook or something
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0037812_0037941	even if one of us can't make it
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0018238_0018642	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0104422_0104524	yeah probably not
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0029176_0029382	small but bright i think
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0107984_0108254	you have to sort of come up with a solution for that
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0102714_0102868	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0036933_0037201	so should we try to draw like a triangle or something
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0203437_0203591	okay make a new one
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0038570_0038686	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0050574_0050717	oh you go there
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0034102_0034749	okay if you take a look at the second one which is a little bit spongy that's something to keep in mind
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0202962_0203257	did you think it was the perfect product or something
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0110616_0110841	so let's not forget the banana thing
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0206578_0206731	uh i think basically he said
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0016945_0017081	yeah that could be the green one i guess
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0167730_0167888	um yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0101290_0101489	uh all the standard stuff
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0094050_0094374	yes
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0110119_0110483	okay where are you in the menu uh right now
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0168444_0168972	and then we can see if it's in the right order or something like that on your remote control
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0185974_0186364	so if we can have a little time left on the end of this project i'll see what i can do
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0022814_0022980	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0118027_0118367	the the the the the the the the the way of the l. c. d. is pretty new
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0084719_0085603	so maybe we should just do that in the in the next meeting to see if there's enough time to um to make something out of it
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0056935_0057083	yeah yeah okay
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0046279_0046699	that shouldn't be that should be either one or the other because i didn't see that
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0042611_0042816	yeah like uh electronics company
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0063546_0063967	yeah but i mean you don't really see it in the in the presentation anyway
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0184862_0185309	yeah if you can see something like that on the l. c. d. then it's okay
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0212701_0212989	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0034749_0035495	and if you take that out then you can't lose it anywhere in the house that's pretty handy i think
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0121116_0121225	okay
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0181137_0181361	so like
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0173031_0173365	oh that's that's not an option
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0115078_0115204	large and yellow
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0127940_0128171	okay
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0141221_0141861	the the logo is just a bit more prominent on the on the front of the remote control itself i guess
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0191862_0191980	yeah not found out yet
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0117342_0117463	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0018512_0019136	yeah but i mean you don't use it all the time in a day right out of one battery anyway
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0126718_0126828	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0073665_0073815	that's where the l. c. d. screen is
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0198132_0198470	oh that's not much it doesn't have to look like that
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0201280_0201698	yeah i don't think there's anything else a little more expensive than the l. c. d. display
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0012838_0013481	the the colour is pretty much the same as the yellow but it has a little bit of red in it
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0110673_0111508	yeah you could look at the l. c. d. screen and maybe add a little extra information on the back of the remote control
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0143171_0143597	yeah but we'll get back to the whole black and white thing in a little bit later
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0155807_0156044	yes
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0190469_0191133	then you can just take out the cover and then we're gonna make it in a different colour or in a different shape or whatever i don't know
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0195394_0195537	okay nice
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0019136_0019281	it opens a menu
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0184735_0184862	yeah i know
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0179135_0179603	the real reaction remote control would probably be a little bit cheaper than that one i guess
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0000872_0001183	okay
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0105467_0105681	yeah i think that's okay
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0116729_0116852	next meeting starts in
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0090041_0090334	um no problem
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0120733_0121028	oh
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0079997_0080387	like for example if you make a multi dimensional l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0066532_0066650	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0047144_0047355	um like we have the curve in the middle
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0146304_0146826	oh yeah it's an example
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0175770_0175999	uh i'm not sure
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0067598_0067821	but i don't know
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0008861_0009603	um the trends are about spongy design which is going to cost a little bit more
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0010620_0010958	um yeah we could do that on the on the p. c. m.
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0151690_0152141	shouldn't have to work together because i couldn't talk to the l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0064653_0064783	but it could be a good idea to
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0091245_0091452	yeah sure
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0051126_0051364	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0183247_0183443	what do you guys say about the curve
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0085854_0085988	yeah so you can print on it
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0028408_0028527	that was more than a two
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0031855_0031976	oh yeah well i mean
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0021798_0022021	it's it's more like if you have a
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0033538_0033648	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0067356_0067509	um not sure
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0040143_0040498	so this is a low um on the scale
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0210996_0211532	and we don't have solar panels so that's kind of a problem
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0128615_0128800	but it's just how it is right
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0197709_0197863	oh okay
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0025014_0026007	and that would mean that we'd have to lose the l. c. d. screen which is one of the most important buttons on the on the board anyway
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0045889_0046271	so the l. c. d. display will take up a lot of the space on the on the total design of the remote control
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0024746_0024904	yes
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0195774_0196406	okay we could have a fruit on top of our remote control
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0098653_0098772	yeah so that means
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0128171_0128615	but wha wha wha what it is like if you take a normal battery right
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0194480_0194796	you can also make it a little bit more expensive by not using rubber
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0203347_0203466	yeah okay
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0144143_0144248	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0167893_0168151	okay but how do we hold it then
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0198623_0198860	it's not even cost effective
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0175679_0176358	oh it's not a smartboard
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0036696_0036798	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0059095_0059365	maybe you wanna see it in the next slide or something
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0066650_0066792	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0092632_0092884	well i'll make that later in the minute
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0160140_0160327	you do get the same thing
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0000037_0000174	fruit and colours
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0150839_0151060	yeah it's just a little more expensive on the on the pen
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0080411_0080636	do you want that yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0065756_0066343	so maybe just change the colours or something like that to make it a little more spongy
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0033648_0034102	maybe i think we could have an l. c. d. maybe that's a good idea
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0182467_0182780	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0176565_0177317	yeah i mean you know what we went through in the last meeting was just a little bit of discussion on how to sell the remote control
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0018372_0018517	everything
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0031661_0031855	what you mean by the speech recognition
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0079024_0079145	it should be finalised by now
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0211213_0211427	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0129092_0129792	just for the next meeting you want to take this list of your findings and put it on the on the shared folder
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0127795_0128003	very clearly yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0139133_0139328	just take out the l. c. d. thing yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0026135_0026438	like a side view of that
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0095954_0096182	and it's called the r. c.
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0041033_0041181	then this is on the l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0109389_0109550	okay
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0181028_0181137	uh just like the basic
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0119796_0120427	but it's it was a little bit more expensive than what i had to make but it's still the same thing
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0052198_0052354	think i might have to do something like that
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0162062_0162239	oh just a little extra marketing discussion
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0144045_0144630	okay let's get back to that
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0210862_0210996	oh
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0031547_0031789	or can it be done with the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0072615_0073007	yeah we need that in the menu uh for the l. c. d. display
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0126161_0126273	that's a problem
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0160037_0160177	star
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0003404_0003804	oh great good
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0040691_0040809	the spokes and
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0192004_0192373	well i think we have to take out a
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0018302_0018699	so we have the l. c. d. display
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0096404_0096606	logo and colour
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0153901_0154781	and then we have the l. c. d. display which is like one and a half euros more expensive than what i was planning on
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0208436_0208731	you have a small remote control with a lot of functions
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0209467_0209577	yeah
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0177666_0177789	oh triple r.
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0013878_0014055	the the look and the feel
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0197125_0197320	so double r. c. you have
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0045291_0045449	and i think just like you had to do in the
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0071604_0071899	it doesn't have to be very long because we don't have a lot of time anyway
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0190727_0190876	aren't we gonna check that out later
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0105647_0105801	so do you think it should be a different colour
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0107796_0107929	oh i see
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0173310_0173625	okay
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0202080_0202399	it's some some kind of display on the l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0024560_0025014	yeah the banana
AMI_EN2002a_H01_FEO070_0094981_0095082	so that's the end of it
AMI_EN2002a_H03_MEE071_0142647_0142936	mechanism
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0101141_0101294	what were you doing again
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0193087_0193279	just a banana
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0145448_0145854	oh we can't
AMI_EN2002a_H00_MEE073_0185309_0185690	like that's like a classic black and yellow banana remote control i guess
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0115704_0115871	okay that makes sense
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0091303_0091783	well i think it's the only thing you have to look out for is um if it's lost in the room
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0038013_0038142	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0113350_0113593	so maybe it's some kind of l. c. d. display
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0112878_0113350	if you look if you look at your remote control as i suppose it's a little bit like this
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0032508_0032636	oh i see
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0133510_0133859	so then it just goes into the l. c. d. display which is that's pretty cool
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0077159_0077621	um there's not a lot of room for the menu but i guess
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0138826_0139583	or we could like you can take out the l. c. d. screen and if you want to make it a little bit more trendy right
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0031677_0031881	was there anything else we wanted to add to the meeting
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0089209_0089625	oh
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0023970_0024180	just go on to the next slide anyway i think
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0045428_0046024	we decided to make the l. c. d. screen so we are a little bit short on the budget
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0126120_0126533	but then you could also make a design that's not only black and white or something like that
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0161805_0161922	yeah exactly the same thing
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0172114_0172473	okay yeah okay that's a nice idea to just one curve on the on the outside
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0125789_0125942	and to make it a real trend
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0136598_0136789	so that's not really a problem
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0065557_0065912	that means the end of this meeting
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0175251_0175396	oh
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0023249_0023358	yes
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0143725_0143963	oh we don't have to do that right now
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0136789_0136955	you just cut out the fancy look and the
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0156582_0157089	yeah it doesn't really matter but you just don't do it all the same every day
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0099364_0099946	just look at what it's supposed to do in the first place which is a little bit hard to understand if you're not used to it
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0082502_0083092	if we want to have a lot of different colours on our remote control then we don't want it to be under twelve and a half
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0034821_0035259	yeah that's not that's not too bad i think
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0033101_0033591	okay i think we're pretty much in agreement on what we want to do
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0071456_0071927	so you could just take out the l. c. d. screen and that's all there is to do with it
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0130301_0130473	it would be just a little bit spongy
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0018936_0019111	so it's not really an option
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0121635_0121783	yeah that's true yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0023513_0023630	uh
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0126624_0126989	yeah if we make the l. c. d. display then that's gonna be an extra problem
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0064215_0064651	yeah but it's more time consuming to make all the buttons in one thing
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0174290_0174848	okay we're designing a trendy black and yellow
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0106955_0107583	um yeah in the middle it's a little bit more wide than when you take out the um the extra menu button
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0034973_0035184	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0085733_0086046	um so the bottom half is solid and the top half is rubber
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0085080_0085345	what uh what's your thing again
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0032460_0032772	that's that's why you want the l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0169934_0170046	maybe a l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0068274_0068805	um i thought it was a little bit more expensive than what we had at the start
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0169706_0169850	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0087384_0087866	maybe it's a little bit too much if you do that on top of what we already had
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0171724_0172114	yeah okay i can see that if you want to have the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0045439_0045574	basic idea pretty clear
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0047298_0047592	take out the l. c. d. and give me a two
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0021454_0021977	so i think that you could do a lot more than just the l. c. d. screen if you had some extra money to spend
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0091653_0091831	yeah let's see
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0042375_0042600	it's all about trendiness of course
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0164101_0164355	putting a little bit of black on it
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0047576_0047898	should we put something like that in the l. c. d. screen to help him look at it
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0058470_0058757	if we lose the l. c. d. screen then everything is okay
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0042968_0043351	plastic is yeah twelve and a half euros
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0175396_0175540	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0098888_0099364	like an example of something like that which is on the market in a couple of years
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0128989_0129377	so i guess it's just a design issue
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0132233_0133122	it's just a little more emphasis on the l. c. d. screen and less emphasis on the numbers and this is just my opinion
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0144569_0145137	just take out a little bit of extra money and make it double curved instead of just straight up and down
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0111951_0112094	uh some
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0174199_0174381	uh it's like no
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0084213_0084627	well the amount of time that we have left on the market is a problem
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0018829_0018936	but that depends on the scroll wheel
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0159237_0159400	it's just it's just a little bit of rubber
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0132149_0132290	oh no
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0094978_0095288	yeah they're more expensive in the international market
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0131930_0132233	don't get too excited i think it's going to take a little time
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0144731_0144890	okay
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0136955_0137127	you would be the second one
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0171687_0171790	but
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0083744_0083850	yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0160891_0161131	yeah i included the voice recognition in the first time
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0041252_0041505	the m. s. m. l. c. d. yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0078856_0079508	you said that you had some problems with the l. c. d. screen and i'm not sure what you mean by that because you don't have a screen
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0024853_0025092	oh that's not a big deal
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0076781_0077134	so do you have a menu or is there an l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0133236_0133358	it doesn't have the logo on it
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0118569_0118766	everybody
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0035247_0035573	we don't have to think about that right now i think that's gonna be a problem
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0121016_0121339	okay now we take out the l. c. d. screen and do it in a different way or something
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0048189_0048321	yeah that's right
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0059565_0059750	oh that's not the new product
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0026408_0026675	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0135590_0136024	if it's not a problem then people are willing to spend twenty five euros on it
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0047485_0047593	uh yeah i
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0129316_0129464	it's fine
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0028436_0028592	you never get a
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0110572_0111480	yeah but the l. c. d. screen is more expensive than the normal push buttons which are basically what you find in a mobile phone
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0041751_0041938	yeah we don't really mean it
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0161282_0162274	so i just wanted to see what's on the l. c. d. screen and that's about it
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0161522_0161681	yeah well maybe you could
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0029731_0030110	that's not an option i guess
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0174089_0174996	okay
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0044006_0044251	uh spongy
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0092292_0092417	yeah maybe
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0091839_0091961	yeah triple r. yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0034547_0034909	are we d are we d is that what we talked about earlier i mean to lose the l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0046016_0046324	basically it's pretty straight forward to design a remote control
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0138184_0138407	you don't have the push button you just have the scroll thing
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0015707_0015897	yeah that's okay
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0046502_0047118	is there any more information on the l. c. d. screen or what you want us to look into
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0041758_0041920	like you do in a normal double curved case
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0024180_0024754	oh oh great
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0176364_0176543	oh okay alright
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0151304_0151743	just take a little time and see how long it takes to learn the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0112214_0112478	um oh no it doesn't come out
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0017785_0018043	think the l. c. d. screen is something like i'm not used to it
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0130473_0130975	let's see let's see what it looks like when it's put on the l. c. d. screen and stuff like that
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0048321_0048439	uh i don't really want to do it
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0095725_0095842	yeah maybe we should do that
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0172473_0172728	yeah i think that's good enough to put in there
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0023859_0023970	yeah that's okay
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0150225_0150542	just a little bit more i guess to get used to working together
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0116540_0116682	okay
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0124910_0125118	or not at all straight or so
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0088813_0089409	just just no no no no just just a normal push button remote control
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0056905_0057415	what i think we could do is make a whole remote control out of it
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0016742_0017526	yeah this could be just a simple l. c. d. screen um we could just do some extra stuff with it
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0127290_0127571	we don't have to make it just like that or anything
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0079643_0079886	at the end of the day
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0125942_0126120	could have done some extra work on the design
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0158908_0159085	yeah it's it's up to the l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0053740_0054016	should we change the l. c. d. display
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0132163_0132382	yeah i don't think that's not an issue
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0063158_0063436	so i'm gonna see what i wanna do on this one when i get to it
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0173283_0173628	probably a vegetable
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0065968_0066281	um it's not a lot
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0141101_0141775	it's just like um the l. c. d. screen um on top of your remote control
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0025799_0025919	how long i have to tell it
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0137251_0138184	you don't know if it's the the the the the the the thing that you get on the on the remote control or something like that
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0164381_0164747	yeah but then you have to decide if this is a single curve or a double curve
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0149964_0150225	and easy to lose them anyway
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0028943_0029179	up down left right
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0114691_0114955	let's see something like that on the top
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0109343_0109760	just like we had in the first meeting which was supposed to be a little discussion on things like this
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0039384_0039848	we plan to make a product in the form of
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0074504_0074606	too small on top yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0023630_0023745	that's a good idea
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0152397_0153316	yeah because the l. c. d. screen is gonna be a little bit more expensive than you would have expected
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0079969_0080142	okay
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0103329_0103842	um yeah it's just a little bit of extra stuff that comes from the l. c. d. display
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0168522_0168675	so that's the end of it
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0176882_0177179	well
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0175983_0176353	um yeah a total of twenty five minutes
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0029595_0030227	so
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0028668_0028943	maybe you just lose your remote control
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0081582_0082029	well as long as it's um if we take this as a limit for the price
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0109120_0109343	um isn't that gonna stand out
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0030764_0031418	yeah yeah then you have to do it with one of those yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0131287_0131598	it could be a little bit longer but it would look pretty good on the display
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0086485_0086802	so it's just like you just lost it in the couch or something
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0069665_0070203	so it's like an l. c. d. screen on top of it or something
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0047900_0048145	maybe maybe we should skip the l. c. d. display
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0031329_0031464	um let's see
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0029280_0029409	yeah maybe so
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0145900_0146161	okay
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0071927_0072435	and you could just take out the l. c. d. screen and make it a little bit thicker on the on the sides
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0169683_0170405	yeah maybe a little bit
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0062365_0063158	yeah i would have liked it to be a little bit more high tech on the on the remote control side but that's alright
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0104204_0104330	well have a look
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0164747_0165061	if you look into the menu there's not a lot of options to do with it
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0092417_0092558	yeah that's not true
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0129377_0129503	but anyway well
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0135186_0135590	so if you if it's not a part of the speech
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0032636_0032810	oh that's the one on the okay
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0163372_0163537	that doesn't make that much difference
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0049921_0050095	yeah but maybe we don't know it yet
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0147522_0147857	let's just see what they want to use the l. c. d. display
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0055519_0055766	more specifically the l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0109760_0110058	we should be able to handle that with our l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0051363_0051551	okay
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0106677_0106952	or at least that's our double r. c.
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0147168_0147522	okay i'm just trying to think of a way to make the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0114635_0114909	oh yeah let's say ten and a half
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0094497_0094659	how do we want the end product to look like
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0027526_0027739	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0174848_0174986	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0079847_0079969	alright
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0105308_0105835	when you're looking for the advanced options in your l. c. d. which is a little bit of a problem
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0162852_0163194	it's it's just some of the information that i have to put into the minutes
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0064651_0065348	so we'll have an l. c. d. screen on it anyway so i don't know if we can save the money on that
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0147857_0148685	just like you said we could lose the l. c. d. display and just put an l. c. d. display on the top of the remote control or something like that
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0014147_0014312	yeah i have
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0046324_0046575	yeah that's a two
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0158643_0158795	but it doesn't have to look anywhere else
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0131677_0131891	it's probably better to do it yourself
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0084148_0084359	so like a square button or something
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0031135_0031257	let's have a t. v. s
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0131891_0132149	yeah just like
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0026045_0026664	um you will do the same and then we'll see if it falls into the budget
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0120335_0121016	that's not a lot of that's just like what we discussed in the last meeting on the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0106952_0107083	so that's
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0168840_0169092	oh we still have a lot of money
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0143107_0143373	but maybe that's even better than an l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0027533_0027852	you know what i'm all about
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0089503_0089859	so so if we take this one which is square and you want to lose the curve
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0067581_0067962	well still a little bit short i think on the design side
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0141775_0142195	and then it's just like a little bit strange to see the curve going all the way to the bottom
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0055764_0056002	well you can't oh no you won't
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0154087_0154810	yeah but you don't see a lot of people buying that one because it's a little bit pricey and they already have one on their d. v. d. player
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0090467_0090932	um let's say it's on top and then you can have some extra buttons
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0057638_0057891	so yeah like in the excel file or something
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0004581_0004696	oh make it a funny animal
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0172761_0173069	yeah the menu button
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0176443_0176700	it's a three
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0075640_0075774	let's see what the trend is
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0124458_0124617	yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0094729_0094978	yeah maybe i missed something in the project
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0031257_0031387	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0115991_0116432	oh i think it's not a lot of money
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0121398_0121828	it's very little bit more difficult when you don't have the money to make a lot of new stuff
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0171979_0172091	oh i don't think so
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0059545_0059671	that's the double r. okay
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0013743_0013850	okay yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0115317_0115547	yeah it's not a one anyway
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0071209_0071456	take out the l. c. d. display and replace it with an l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0053774_0054353	so we should probably not put the l. c. d. display or speech recognition in there
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0012313_0012414	like the top man
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0093986_0094497	yeah if you want to make the l. c. d. screen that's uh that's an extra yeah that's no problem
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0162560_0162760	if you make it a little bit more durable that would be cool
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0024214_0024440	okay
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0045213_0045428	and you can say yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0056791_0056905	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0162054_0162383	um yeah i'd like to look into it
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0042654_0042791	more or less
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0154810_0154970	if you want to do that
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0104599_0105080	so how do you take the l. c. d. screen into the remote control itself for example
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0121828_0122215	there's a bit more space between them than if they're on top of each other
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0018560_0018829	oh yeah yeah that's a good idea for the l. c. d. screen actually
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0118766_0119675	okay i mean if we take out the l. c. d. display we're gonna have to make it a little bit more expensive
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0008661_0008947	we're losing the numbers anyway
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0065842_0065968	oh the pen
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0093620_0094088	well yeah i guess we all agree on the on the layout of course but there's a lot more to it than that
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0162274_0162383	think it's a little
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0041627_0041784	yeah you should have a special form
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0020013_0020117	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0168333_0168547	so it's good
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0152034_0152305	oh no it shouldn't be
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0093846_0093986	how to open it
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0023125_0023329	oh not perfect in fact
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0103842_0104599	just to just to get an idea of how much time you're going to spend on designing a d a design and not doing it
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0078362_0078473	so that's pretty handy
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0115547_0115719	oh nice
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0059750_0059870	oh no
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0139583_0140140	if it's going to take a lot of time to learn how to work with an l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0162278_0162642	yeah let's do it like this and you have one here and one down here
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0048321_0048484	okay
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0060166_0060504	now we have to talk a little bit about finance
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0025267_0025508	oh
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0077134_0077273	is there something that i should
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0148685_0148921	yeah you have a lot of rubber in it anyway
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0072435_0073145	so you just take out the l. c. d. screen and i guess it's gonna make it a little bit more expensive to put the l. c. d. screen in
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0014437_0014850	oh no i mean if we take out the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0153323_0153432	yeah that's the problem here
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0174381_0174703	that's all there is
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0023358_0023660	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0036715_0036928	yeah that's yeah that's right
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0087255_0087384	and you choose one
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0003990_0004240	okay let's just take this out
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0149408_0149827	so i'm gonna have to take some more time on this
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0060504_0060724	we could just make it a one
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0102270_0102935	if you lose a remote control then it's a little bit of a problem if you wanna play with the sound recording
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0125288_0125530	yeah i think that's that's what we like
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0003703_0003815	okay great
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0012730_0013102	so it's always an option anyway
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0015004_0015184	oh yeah well that's just the whole thing
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0142195_0142837	it's just a little bit more expensive to make an l. c. d. screen if you can
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0075776_0075883	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0128644_0128816	it's the only thing we're doing now
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0059159_0059383	are you gonna have a lot of time left
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0087866_0088246	just putting everything into the database is gonna take a lot of time anyway
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0089021_0089334	okay no no not take out a three and a half anyway
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0130120_0130471	take out the l. c. d. display take out the voice recognition yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0079699_0079847	yeah okay
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0061496_0061766	do you have any more suggestions for the menu
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0170268_0170525	it's not sorry
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0078524_0078671	but i think that will not be a problem
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0067239_0067390	for the development
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0156430_0156582	what's the latest information on fashion
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0018043_0018395	just stick your right hand on top of the one you just drew down there
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0044869_0045188	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0086849_0086950	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0127716_0128450	it's not like we took the remote control and then we lost the l. c. d. screen because we didn't have enough money
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0125664_0125902	so that's what we're all thinking about
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0048678_0049161	even if it's a little bit more expensive than the other options we have at the moment
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0036788_0037258	we don't have a lot of space on the l. c. d. screen so that's something to think about
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0164968_0165091	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0038266_0038901	and we didn't say yeah we didn't say the l. c. d. display
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0101561_0101936	if you get if you get the menu you just do it straight away
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0119829_0119979	but taking out the rubber right
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0029410_0029595	but i'm not in a lot of time anyway
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0083092_0083471	so that you can't lose the curve in the in the design of the thing itself
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0140051_0140536	it's just it's just a little bit of speech recognition for the t. v. s
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0022984_0023725	think it's pretty handy to have a pen
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0025658_0025799	um i'm supposed to have done this
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0157956_0158182	of special colour of course the l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0013822_0013944	okay
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0020117_0020934	okay so this is just a little summary of our findings and um yeah you can see that there's some problems on the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0157402_0157749	well that's the only problem i had with the last meeting is that it's a lot of time
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0036472_0036842	we should have done this more often i suppose
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0148921_0149202	putting the logo on a remote control and making it look like a different brand
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0123724_0123835	yeah like
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0058396_0058593	let's see what we should do
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0120575_0120691	it's a bloated p. c.
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0042132_0042351	exactly
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0101496_0101599	if it's coming from where
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0107851_0108601	and i think that's what we should aim for is um the l. c. d. display you had something like that
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0077621_0077969	so i'm just gonna make a list of what you had to do in the last time
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0146596_0146733	oh sorry you're right
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0115208_0115321	most of the time i think so
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0153159_0153266	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0008166_0008661	the meeting is still over actually
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0074447_0074908	yeah that's the the name on the on the left one
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0044105_0044380	so just take out the l. c. d. display and see how much time we have left
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0037281_0037580	yeah but that's just one thing we didn't really discuss
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0078539_0078676	so you don't ask me that
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0060724_0061147	then we can lose the l. c. d. screen and one of the scroll wheels like i mentioned earlier
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0125902_0126033	but this is actually more expensive
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0012470_0012730	just started working on the project that i got out of the other company
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0023725_0023859	oh
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0021247_0021366	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0134183_0134337	it's just the button supplement
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0031881_0032249	let's let's see what you mean and then you can explain it
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0036107_0036226	good thing it's a cheap feature
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0174996_0175109	let's go to
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0098204_0098433	um yeah you just don't
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0027739_0028052	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0171516_0171724	or do you want to oh okay
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0079598_0079699	oh
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0129404_0129617	yeah you don't really need to do anything with it yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0138300_0138507	then they can eat it
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0163537_0164018	but maybe we should make it a little bit thicker on the on the top and then put the buttons in the middle
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0028865_0029045	yeah he peeped
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0140531_0141101	we could just make it a little bit more expensive i think if you want to use the l. c. d. display or something like that
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0060478_0060694	yeah maybe it yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0143934_0144261	oh i wouldn't put it like that just put it on top of the remote control to be honest
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0086802_0087255	if you want to stick to one battery like that then it's pretty straight forward in your t. r. s. c.
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0033591_0034574	um the thing is that we should think of a remote control that uh it's one piece of equipment really
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0049366_0049523	so it's not doing something special
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0121631_0121738	yeah that's true
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0079506_0079643	now
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0153441_0153811	oh no
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0126896_0127147	well i mean we're not really uh
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0144532_0144657	oh no
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0038837_0039136	we're all familiar with the things that they want to have in it
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0036226_0036472	finish the final report and close the meeting
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0064860_0065078	well
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0018395_0018519	let's see what can happen
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0105335_0105452	yeah you can manage yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0161799_0161936	maybe you could put a sticker on it
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0039295_0039468	what are we talking about now
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0023745_0024214	let's just make it a double r.
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0048439_0048678	it's not it's not gonna be a major issue
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0175540_0175983	like for a like for a remote control
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0159496_0159838	where is the remote control
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0015441_0015688	yeah i mean that's basically what we did here in this meeting
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0028261_0028966	let's let's have a small p. c.
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0154970_0155409	uh i don't know if there's any more money left in the project or whatever
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0079886_0080250	we agreed on that
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0019391_0020010	just a beep or some kind of sound when the button is pressed and then you can find out where it is
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0174099_0174290	oh
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0113936_0114207	think it's a nice logo on top or something
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0036594_0036788	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0005954_0006231	let's see if i can do that
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0043505_0043786	let's see
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0146289_0147004	did you did you finish the last meeting with a little summary of what we talked about
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0025379_0025658	yeah okay if you want to make it a little bit more yellow
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0042719_0042856	yeah it's a good point yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0013926_0014135	are we
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0115533_0115991	alright nice technology
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0083471_0083998	if you just take all the fancy colours like yellow and black or something like that
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0065078_0065557	well it doesn't really matter what the l. c. d. screen is as long as you can
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0119968_0120335	that was just that we had to go out of our budget
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0049534_0049781	yeah we didn't make it big enough to make it stand out maybe
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0163194_0163417	so you take out the speech recognition and you stick with it
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0123311_0123783	okay let's just take out the l. c. d. display and stick with a simple one on top
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0093080_0093213	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0163985_0164101	or something like that
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0059749_0059852	okay
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0090755_0090862	all the other ones
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0057891_0058016	yeah exactly
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0125458_0125580	there's something different in it
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0100175_0100452	and then we're still in the forty percent of our target group huh
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0041920_0042435	yeah we yeah you mean that we lost the curve
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0089859_0090212	so there's a lot of room for the l. c. d. yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0046238_0046442	oh really no
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0092178_0092282	yeah exactly
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0057650_0058070	but we had the idea that maybe you have a lot of money left on it
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0066537_0066801	let's all do this on the l. c. d. screen then
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0114909_0115049	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0066825_0067239	how about the entire design
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0016792_0016898	it's something from the past
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0151881_0152103	well that's my part of the marketing report again
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0150688_0151137	is it easy to use a remote control is a little bit of problem
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0093213_0093492	and we could even make a menu for the l. c. d. display
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0054833_0054945	alright
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0050130_0050484	yeah they might want to add it in there
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0090405_0090683	yeah i like that idea of the curve definitely
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0123113_0123303	so as to as a possibility
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0101260_0101496	so let's see
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0144261_0144569	even if it's just a curve on the remote control itself not on the l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0125531_0125664	yeah i know
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0026675_0027547	like i told you a little while ago um it's kind of hard to look at when you're looking at the whole remote control
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0113476_0113968	okay maybe we should just yeah i mean that could be done on the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0178273_0178394	for the r. c. yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0055312_0055519	let's say it's the same as the l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0065912_0066273	and so it's a little bit more expensive than some of the other options out there
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0170405_0170552	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0124313_0124485	at the end of the day it's more important
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0043351_0043505	yeah that's that's true that's true
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0051348_0051744	yeah it's just the menu button you can do yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0114147_0114464	oh i'm not sure i haven't come up with it
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0131598_0131725	and you don't lose a curve just one
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0105878_0106013	oh yeah oh sorry
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0040496_0041100	and i think we should make sure the l. c. d. display is more important than the speech recognition anyway
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0164255_0164357	oh maybe not
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0115049_0115317	okay that's a number
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0042801_0043608	oh oh
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0118130_0118569	did you read the minutes of the last meeting anyway
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0031418_0031794	let's see what you have on the other end
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0044331_0044624	oh it's a pleasure
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0174493_0174669	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0019159_0019391	yeah you can skip the l. c. d. screen and yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0080142_0080966	um yeah i'm not sure if there's a lot of money left in the project to make all the extra stuff that you just talked about
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0105080_0105308	that's that's about straight out of the top right corner there
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0145518_0145969	it's just it was just a little bit of creativity to try to come up with something new
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0063436_0063952	and i'm gonna make a new one on the l. c. d. screen just in case you don't have an internet connection
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0086046_0086485	um that's what we're gonna do with it anyway so that's not something that i need to worry about
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0125286_0125531	okay then that that's not the end of it
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0175109_0175452	haven't used my pen
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0084835_0085080	is it a logo or is it your name
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0173304_0173568	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0090212_0090467	for one euro uh i don't think that's really true
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0041160_0041286	that's this one
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0160386_0160730	so why are we gonna lose the l. c. d. uh remote control
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0051551_0051685	take out your l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0044624_0045064	you don't have an l. c. d. display anyway
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0042609_0042719	yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0101936_0102270	and then there's the same thing with a speech recognition on it
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0173660_0174199	and i think that's like a nice way to wrap up the end report actually
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0035738_0036107	do we have to think of something that's gonna give us a little help with the cost
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0136024_0136232	but i mean that's not a big issue
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0140536_0140696	there's a lot of spongy stuff
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0035060_0035247	yeah i don't think so sorry
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0096204_0096458	maybe an l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0054353_0054961	how much would that save us in the in the end if we decided to use rubber instead of um
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0051744_0052069	uh the sample sensor is a little bit problem
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0096458_0096585	should be feasible i guess
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0169707_0170268	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0098797_0099022	so the remote control has to be trendy
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0078221_0078524	let's not let's not lose it
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0044380_0044595	it's just a zero
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0140401_0140531	oh
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0153855_0154032	to have a fruit on it
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0136952_0137075	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0054984_0055312	well i'll just put that in the project document because we can't close it
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0021977_0022293	um otherwise yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0088442_0088847	the seventy five percent of the time they spend on a remote control
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0058775_0059373	yeah okay yeah just take the one with the speech recognition and we'll get rid of it
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0018361_0018535	yeah that can be done in the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0106358_0106545	you have to use each other
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0145283_0145518	we didn't stick to the twelve and a half euro so
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0173065_0173652	and then we can sell it at twenty and a half
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0058351_0058470	oh oh
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0014850_0015021	well maybe we need to talk about that in a minute
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0078676_0078817	oh alright
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0082114_0082502	um do we want some extra features on the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0073145_0073437	and that's still the top ten on the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0050095_0050312	let's have a party
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0122353_0122857	well actually we just made a list of the stuff that we still need to implement
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0143963_0144215	oh it's just a little bit too expensive for the price i pay
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0090855_0091354	but you don't want the remote control to be a one point one point two point something with the l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0095959_0096134	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0058198_0058396	does this remote control
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0143373_0143725	and then we could put that in the profit and loss statement for example
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0029691_0030275	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0030488_0030619	so i'll send it to you
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0022293_0022953	um i don't want you to spend too much time trying to find out if it's possible or not for example on the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0029133_0029280	yeah right
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0175479_0175581	oh ha ha
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0032249_0032460	the only yellow is here
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0052069_0052298	let's see what happens
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0155409_0155526	it's only a little bit too expensive
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0168547_0168840	anything else we want to talk about
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0164930_0165079	yeah maybe you right
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0176873_0177267	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0037935_0038266	but in the case of speech recognition and l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0067962_0068274	oh yeah but it won't come up
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0055240_0055341	yeah pretty much
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0108601_0108763	like like you have here
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0124801_0124917	yeah okay yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0112478_0112878	and that's how long it takes to load the channels and that's how long it takes
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0020888_0020992	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0129704_0130120	but i think what we should do is like a little l. c. d. display on the top of it for example
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0085039_0085733	so what we talked about last time was um the l. c. d. screen and stuff
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0016426_0016728	so that's just something we could do to improve the design yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0134416_0135016	you had to do the research and you didn't find out that the remote control would not work with the l. c. d. display
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0123720_0124313	yeah only on the l. c. d. menu you select a specific channel or something like that
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0021313_0021454	yes
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0115367_0115504	yeah why
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0032772_0033027	yeah yeah that's just straight out of a curve
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0109010_0109145	what would you make it in the end
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0095288_0095598	so that's kind of money saved yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0153316_0153441	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0106024_0106677	okay so there's a little bit more time for you to work on it than if you were under the twelve and a half euro budget
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0061780_0062365	um i still have to find out if it's possible to implement that in our budget or not
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0157089_0157402	if it's like the first one then it's a little strange
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0015184_0015707	we're going to put the speech recognition and the l. c. d. screen into our product anyway aren't we
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0059383_0059545	are you gonna have to make it a lot longer
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0138548_0138826	but i mean you can say no
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0066273_0066537	oh you mean it works on the l. c. d. display right
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0049161_0049366	that's not going to be a big deal
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0108763_0109120	so i think that was a one
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0142837_0143107	uh i guess it's just a little bit of confusion on the finance part
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0172091_0172338	it doesn't matter
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0004495_0004612	let's use the l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0002480_0002851	okay what they want to see
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0041286_0041566	yeah or some more light on the bottom side
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0146180_0146289	it'll be done
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0130967_0131486	let's take out the advanced chip for the advanced options
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0024443_0024853	and i don't think they like yellow and black anyway
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0020992_0021379	at the end of each product we want to sell
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0068805_0069665	but if you look at the design maybe that's what we could have done to uh not lose the curve
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0088240_0088442	what have you have you come up with
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0074908_0075230	is it the the the end of the product or the end of the contract
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0099946_0100175	it's hard to tell where it's a triple r. or something
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0100452_0101260	it's just a little bit more expensive than an l. c. d. display but it gives us an option in the menu
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0178394_0178659	let's have a little fun
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0081248_0081582	just to clarify what we're actually looking for in the l. c. d. display
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0171165_0171447	or or just shake it to see if it's okay
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0057415_0057650	oh maybe we should yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0038504_0038624	we didn't think of that at all
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0077969_0078306	maybe you can show us your presentation later on
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0015897_0016426	so that's just a little problem with the l. c. d. display if you want to make some extra profit
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0032386_0032508	oh that's more
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0030110_0030238	oh it's alright
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0149202_0149408	let's just see what they do in the design
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0058979_0059114	yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0124485_0124910	just put it on the l. c. d. display and we'll lose the speech recognition part
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0026408_0026889	uh you can put it in the finance
AMI_EN2002b_H00_FEO070_0074139_0074374	so just put it in the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0111480_0111676	so i'm not sure how long it's gonna take
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0048322_0048580	we probably won't do it anyway
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0004240_0004381	okay let's start again
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0164018_0164192	yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0155864_0156372	it's like the one that they have on the t. v. and it's just a little bit more fancy in the way that it's done
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0037097_0037360	the yeah
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0122144_0122353	why why do you want an l. c. d. in it
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0158182_0158649	it's only for the l. c. d. display
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0027852_0028436	you just make it a little bit bigger on one side or whatever i don't know where to go with that
AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0094088_0094233	so that's a bad idea
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0050861_0051348	teletext teletext button and the l. c. d. display
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0084627_0084835	is that a round shape or a square
AMI_EN2002b_H01_MEE071_0117869_0117982	but the um
AMI_EN2002b_H02_FEO072_0091831_0092168	if you get a message from the l. c. d. screen for example
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0118453_0118825	yeah but the logo of the company in the black you know
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0047777_0048030	that would be the easy part yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0187875_0188443	yeah just to give them an idea of what they might get on the menu and uh yeah that could be a good thing
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0055476_0055829	for the cover i could put that on top and then use a different one
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0249998_0250371	well we've got a total cost of twelve and a half euros
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0249215_0249491	maybe i don't have an l. c. d. screen on it
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0254887_0254996	okay
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0023520_0024002	so how are you gonna have a l. c. d. display um in your remote control
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0005496_0005698	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0079726_0079893	you mean hit the delete button
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0252592_0252753	like you know five minus one
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0053683_0053812	oh yeah that uh
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0099083_0099438	well the l. c. d. screen is a problem
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0134197_0134354	uh do they really like the double r. c.
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0225023_0225259	let's let's not do that anyway
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0197610_0198058	let's begin with the last one
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0140243_0140790	if the l. c. d. is too expensive then maybe do the speech recognition on the on the button itself
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0213265_0213415	oh i see what you mean
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0025463_0025733	and then just talk on top of it one curve over the other curve
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0103783_0103949	oh sh oh should
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0070272_0070386	so that's good
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0124048_0124307	the volume and the teletext menu is way too long
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0051055_0051227	alright
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0235796_0236117	it's not really okay
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0127554_0128257	you could use the l. c. d. menu if you want to go a little bit more advanced in the in the design
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0287945_0288070	take it
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0237959_0238103	let's see what you
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0278313_0278617	just like we talked about in the last meeting if we lose the speech recognition feature
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0201912_0202445	just a little menu on the l. c. d. screen i guess
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0028802_0028920	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0282399_0282559	how much longer are you supposed to
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0147353_0147533	the colour yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0265828_0266434	but if you have a lot of stuff like that then you have to have some more space for things like menu
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0184560_0184752	okay
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0213415_0213551	in the sample sensor yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0157347_0157497	yeah definitely yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0069110_0069420	well it won't take very long anyway to finish up
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0125139_0125328	it's not not that bad of an idea
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0103036_0103596	uh it's the menu button i think that's the way you make a menu on the l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0057373_0057710	the l. c. d. doesn't have to be on top of course
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0099438_0100082	sebastian has some some some m uh some t. v. remote control
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0068607_0068783	yeah i mean is it
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0088289_0089001	just take out the l. c. d. screen and uh do an extra two euros on the on the total cost to make it twelve and a half euros
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0247021_0247144	but that's more than the r. c.
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0060210_0060321	so it doesn't take the cost
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0090150_0090373	are you sure
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0049224_0049723	so for example if you take out the l. c. d. screen and the speech recognition
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0176931_0177652	but if you take the l. c. d. screen then it's a little bit more expensive than if you just have the normal push buttons
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0042950_0043546	because i mean there's there's more than just the l. c. d. um that you can use on the remote control
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0236758_0236869	oh really
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0149838_0149964	innovative
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0164818_0164960	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0160488_0160600	running light taking that
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0053812_0053941	oh that
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0109093_0109356	can you not get an email on this
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0223637_0223889	think that's enough
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0255898_0256003	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0050258_0050422	okay right
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0132681_0132824	basic menu for the buttons
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0225317_0225963	you know that's not how you're supposed to do it i'm not sure
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0047715_0047843	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0050561_0050671	yes rubber is expensive
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0208441_0208990	just take out the l. c. d. screen and you still have to make up a new one on top of it or something like that
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0218519_0218657	and we take that one out like this kind of deal
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0174008_0174408	and that would be a great way to sell it in a black and green package
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0272402_0272761	yeah you just maybe you just do it in a real time
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0053116_0053476	it's just one like one extra option for l. c. d. or voice recognition
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0028342_0028849	if we implement a speech recognition system there's a little problem with the more expensive part of the remote
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0226994_0227437	well that'll be up to the marketing people to come up with a name
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0044823_0045043	and um the same thing for the sound
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0256612_0256834	yeah we should do that on the on the product yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0203527_0203630	do a little bit of both
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0118903_0119072	yeah the menu yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0209204_0209467	drop the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0143073_0143304	do you have the industrial designer to help us out with that
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0162209_0162322	yeah true
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0130824_0131060	yeah that makes sense
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0276514_0276625	so i can say that
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0098398_0098686	what kind of scroll wheel do we want
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0063528_0063805	after that i thought the most of the stuff was already done so
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0281597_0281750	yeah i think so
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0241644_0241921	oh just gonna come up with a little design
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0069766_0069924	the other question is what does the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0200239_0200457	what was that
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0135159_0135296	ah i love that
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0268832_0269419	maybe it's a little bit too much for the twenty five euros to do with one remote control
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0168814_0168924	don't know
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0119439_0119572	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0124836_0125272	that could be that could be yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0056795_0057141	yeah of course a total of twelve and a half euros
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0037082_0037710	yeah yeah spea spea spea speech recognition is a big thing okay
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0063527_0063800	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0172193_0172508	and then it's just doing the same thing over and over again every day
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0198795_0199338	okay well it's a four then it's alright
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0228698_0229192	maybe just leave it on the l. c. d. screen and just have a little display on the back
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0135332_0135852	wait a minute wait a minute i said the remote control doesn't have to be black
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0260848_0261428	well okay but let's not focus on the l. c. d. display
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0138314_0138521	did we make the menu
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0161177_0161402	yeah yeah yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0089380_0089533	yeah i think personally
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0061353_0061562	just make the the the the the the curves
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0281671_0281788	well
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0171413_0171547	how could you change the colour anyway
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0150429_0150823	it's just one of those things i didn't have a lot of time to do because i had to do it all on my own
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0208152_0208271	yeah that's true yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0133108_0133838	you could just draw us a simple one that we don't already have on the board or something like that
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0167133_0167654	let's just wait a little bit more and see what you make out of the speech recognition anyway
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0258709_0259136	um if we decide to scrap the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0157189_0157624	you don't have to do anything extra just come up with an idea
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0131060_0131406	and the l. c. d. screen that's even more expensive than what we need i suppose
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0070656_0070793	how much time am i supposed to
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0181729_0181889	if you don't have an curve on it
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0274286_0274539	let's just go on to something else because you're a little bit slow
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0021965_0022709	and then you can really look at the the design of the remote control and see that they're all in the same colour or that they're all in the same colour
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0134278_0134441	yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0143784_0144054	um well it would be a little bit of an issue
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0140160_0140436	but if it's the whole thing then there's nothing left
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0188405_0188759	straight forward or straight forward no
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0105765_0105892	yeah that can make sense
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0230548_0230731	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0203630_0203968	so we can yeah you can sell them for
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0149086_0149296	up button
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0248492_0248785	my favourite animal
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0042237_0042339	one is the problem
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0061822_0062225	the second most important thing is that the back of the cover should not slip off
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0254517_0254873	well i mean it's alright on the l. c. d. screen if you take out the rubber
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0213571_0214400	it's just the same thing as when you go to the store and look at all the different ones that they have on offer and see which one is the best
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0171739_0172055	in the evaluation page the user preference
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0103596_0104380	but that's that's the only curve you get with the with the l. c. d. display
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0273228_0273333	can i discuss a little first
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0205682_0205884	well that's not something i'm used to
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0162322_0162464	it's true
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0072563_0073206	what do you want to do with that right now or are you out of time
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0248688_0248940	oh oh triple r. c.
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0161826_0162209	yeah i wasn't sure if it was yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0151721_0151946	just because if you have the l. c. d. screen that's great
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0203968_0204271	and this is a little bit more expensive than i'd like to say
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0199722_0200105	yeah it's not the only option but it's definitely a possibility
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0034640_0034795	yeah that's okay
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0251707_0251921	if we don't want one then that's fine
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0002066_0002306	oops
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0104515_0104905	let's just assume that we don't have the l. c. d. screen on a remote control anyway
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0160264_0160488	yeah but that's on the left side
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0195904_0196265	if they're looking for a product that looks like the one on the right
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0175914_0176170	do we lose the l. c. d. screen when we want to use the more advanced
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0242860_0243033	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0054355_0054561	well it's just too expensive you have to tell me
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0241212_0241619	okay so anyway what did we decide on
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0199005_0199280	yeah okay
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0264093_0264561	if if if we lose the l. c. d. screen then it's okay
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0138712_0139019	um do the extra features you need actually
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0200585_0200849	of fruit
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0169308_0169412	it's come up again
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0050993_0051116	you have to get rid of the l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0165350_0165897	but if we're focusing on the younger people then it's more important to make something that looks trendy
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0207407_0207598	yeah as well
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0144032_0144273	that that's the end of the remote control itself
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0235971_0236358	you know something like an on and off switch in the middle of it or something
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0138687_0138799	well can i
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0173224_0174008	um just to give you an idea of the total cost of the l. c. d. display and the speech recognition
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0090305_0090583	they can't do it if they don't have the money
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0184287_0185068	so um i'm not sure how long it's gonna take to come up with a little bit of something like that
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0175414_0175908	if it's gonna get lost in the couch or something then that's a little bit of an issue with the l. c. d. screen anyway
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0134088_0134278	yeah the last one
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0103440_0103544	yeah right
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0193944_0194339	because we have a one but we don't have an l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0147775_0147937	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0260094_0260376	um it's just pressing the
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0075245_0075906	yeah but i mean you could take out the l. c. d. screen and then yeah that's alright with me
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0161107_0161604	the l. c. d. is pretty much the same as it would be on a standard remote control
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0016779_0017338	okay well what we came up with is the l. c. d. display and speech recognition on top of it
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0217577_0217753	oh we don't use yellow we don't use special colour
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0239098_0239480	so you take out the l. c. d. screen and replace it with a
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0136433_0136556	okay let's just get out of this
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0126076_0126392	drop the l. c. d. screen and stick it on your t. v.
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0238529_0238836	is this is this an alternative solution
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0230731_0230930	let's it's nice anyway
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0205757_0205864	oh i wasn't right
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0106524_0106641	oh
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0271599_0271853	oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0220084_0220230	yeah no
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0220248_0220721	oh that's true that's true but that's just you have to um
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0237892_0238062	oh no
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0238062_0238529	and after this meeting you get a summary of the discussion and the decisions that were made
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0209594_0209856	oh yeah one or the one and a half
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0183640_0183894	okay that's okay
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0251001_0251148	yeah well you yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0112036_0112390	okay then the only one left would be the remote
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0221165_0221415	go on go to your individual work and you can give me the results
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0281256_0281671	so that's not really a
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0287732_0287850	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0054132_0054324	well
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0175908_0176137	so yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0207616_0207937	but i mean the thing is you want to make it a little bit more trendy
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0065949_0066289	if you give me if you give me another one i'll work on it
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0248492_0248671	but oh
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0254165_0254342	but i don't think that will be a problem
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0182591_0182876	but yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0166691_0167133	yeah if you if you have like a menu structure in your remote control
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0229367_0229594	it's not the same thing as a curve is it
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0010398_0010516	so we're gonna have the logo
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0246596_0246706	personally i don't know
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0031695_0032375	so you can have it on the l. c. d. screen and it can be a little bit more expensive to have the speech recognition
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0264931_0265179	um if they are enough to make it
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0082847_0083407	um they like spongy feel they like dark colours and um we have these two options
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0146188_0146938	so if you make a special edition of the remote control which is part of the p. d. a. program it's gonna be a bit more expensive
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0179386_0179709	so that's yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0130271_0130817	yeah but then you have to make sure that it's not lost in the in the room or something like that with the speech recognition and everything
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0199684_0200295	it's like they don't care about the name of our company anymore
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0199338_0199448	you can have a fruit as well
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0101760_0101866	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0270631_0270975	you could you could put a logo on it and you could even change the colour as well
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0229882_0230290	maybe it's just an idea to build in a speech recognition system
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0180329_0180467	yeah sure could work with that
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0181393_0181581	importance of the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0191972_0192304	blue blue based remote controls are pretty standard
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0230659_0230821	and then it doesn't go in the l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0246706_0246996	need to buy a l. c. d. display
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0207456_0207592	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0169607_0169964	yeah just like an old black and red design
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0272028_0272402	yeah just just just yeah just draw it
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0075146_0075269	okay yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0116826_0117456	so i think it's just like if you have an l. c. d. screen on your remote control
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0180351_0180980	if you ha if you have an l. c. d. on the remote it's a little bit more expensive
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0033810_0034240	what what do you think about the whole idea of this thing
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0147825_0148187	yeah so yeah the spongy yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0158525_0158712	oh do we need to
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0186781_0187146	but that's pretty much the same thing as a normal remote control
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0274023_0274217	it doesn't have to be entirely hollow
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0027954_0028342	oh yeah just some extra information on the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0216096_0216266	yeah that looks a lot better
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0065605_0065949	it will come back in a couple of seconds
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0161402_0161533	that would just be an extra nice thing
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0278617_0278907	if they don't like that then there's a problem with the l. c. d. display
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0187627_0187906	stop the sound and yeah turn off your t. v.
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0077597_0078132	so um then you can lose the l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0147937_0148548	but that's a little bit of a problem if you drop the speech recognition part then you lose the spongy material
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0025733_0026149	but how much time do we have for that anyway because it's not like what you want to do
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0215704_0216048	and the top is blue and the bottom is yellow so that's pretty cool
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0250419_0250544	how about how 'kay
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0111239_0111597	we don't want a lot of colours because we just came up with something like that
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0030913_0031695	so then it's gonna get lost in the couch and that's a problem because if it's sitting there for a long period of time
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0052355_0052804	or like you can only put one colour on the whole remote control or like that
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0198689_0198979	like if you want to make a new one just leave it like this
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0057730_0058078	because if you make a black one on the top and a white one on the bottom it looks like that
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0087170_0087588	you lose your remote control and you have to buy a new one in the market which is very expensive
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0280998_0281269	so i don't know what i don't know what i don't want
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0181928_0182058	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0172508_0173238	if we're going to lose the l. c. d. screen and the voice recognition then that's gonna cost us a lot of extra money
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0041734_0041973	the price is important but it's not the only one on the market
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0259469_0259873	um the smartboard is just another example of something that's out there
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0193761_0193944	yeah i don't think we need that
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0190217_0190360	yeah yeah you al yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0017338_0017486	so i don't want to take that out
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0071909_0072240	just the l. c. d. display on top of it
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0092783_0092912	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0204383_0204496	you know
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0078938_0079543	yeah and the l. c. d. is just to um yeah on top of your remote control
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0205719_0206009	just the spongy
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0118825_0119318	so is it going to be an l. c. d. display um giving us additional information
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0061553_0062005	oh so that's a that's a all the special colour right
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0176617_0176931	even if it's just going to get lost somewhere in the couch or something like that
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0078818_0078938	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0076114_0076300	okay and at the end yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0270757_0270985	well you still have to do the buttons
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0209471_0209691	yeah that's the same thing you said
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0026808_0026979	oh actually i didn't make that at all
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0153001_0153109	you get the idea here
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0056609_0057022	or just a black and yellow or a red and black or something like that
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0235811_0235971	oh yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0090583_0091142	because if you take it on the on the double curve then you have to make it a little bit thicker 'cause of the curve
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0058924_0059029	yeah that would be a problem yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0236358_0236513	and the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0271683_0271921	so if you can give me your personal coach
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0227691_0227942	and just say you want to use the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0135999_0136107	exactly if you see
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0172055_0172193	well that's what we all think about
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0274305_0274557	oh that's true that's a small one yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0011623_0012020	like if you take out the entire cover and put it in the in the other room or something like that
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0134666_0134793	okay that's alright
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0167571_0168186	but if it's a two then it's a little bit of trouble to design
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0277014_0277640	maybe the l. c. d. screen is an option if we don't have a standard one on the menu
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0062708_0063054	so do you have the numbers there
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0026783_0026961	what's the l. c. d. display going to be
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0044062_0044474	so that we could make a cover that that looks like the the remote control itself
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0063800_0063948	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0264561_0264931	you don't see that on the standard version of our speech recognition box
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0047031_0047163	so you're done with that then
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0256327_0256480	but there's still a lot to come up with
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0227076_0227367	yeah that's a that's a one or a two
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0274873_0275008	just put something like that in it
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0216811_0217577	we need the buttons on the l. c. d. display because we want all the menu options to be accessible in the menu
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0149964_0150187	the functional requirements of the t. v.
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0078579_0078992	so that's why you're not taking it to the next meeting as long as it's ready
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0083866_0084550	so you can just say like yeah i'd like to change the colour of my t. v. because it's really annoying
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0281996_0282399	so if you see yeah if you see it from a three to a one it's alright
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0148964_0149212	push buttons okay
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0030576_0030860	one is necessary and seven is one possibility
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0107714_0107884	and if it falls on the table then it's lost forever
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0069420_0069766	but i don't have all the numbers to display on it yet
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0026149_0026783	because it can come back as well
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0158712_0159014	okay so we're just missing a few more features for our yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0074876_0075176	um yes i have a question
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0250371_0250565	um could it be black
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0288070_0288203	hard to find anyway
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0197378_0197509	how are we gonna how are we gonna do that
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0147303_0147608	the the colour of the cover you know
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0131880_0132180	so you could change the colour on the on the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0009179_0009353	so that's just the same thing you said earlier
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0160737_0161085	but the innovative design
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0027329_0027798	so i think we did a good job in making the l. c. d. menu which is even more important than the l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0277942_0278075	you just have to edit everything
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0051305_0051769	so if you take out the curve you lose the curve which is pretty much what you can do with a remote control
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0193671_0193905	or we could make a green one
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0233878_0233998	um no
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0076744_0076902	so now
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0210117_0210615	because you lose the l. c. d. screen which is basically what you need to make a nice menu out of
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0253648_0254165	maybe if it's a three point five then i'll be able to find a solution for this problem
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0281344_0281597	oh yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0071484_0071909	just have to make a list of all the components i'm gonna use on this project
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0050140_0050561	like one on a one on a remote control
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0035962_0036317	so that's gonna be the l. c. d. thing you have to keep in mind
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0280821_0280998	oh alright um it's not doing very well
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0242621_0243025	like for example the front
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0200457_0200585	exactly
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0204271_0204383	probably
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0149632_0149922	what's the l. c. d. interface
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0204433_0204785	um that's the name
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0162242_0162710	yeah we did
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0255359_0256031	yeah he doesn't care
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0182876_0183163	just put the l. c. d. display on top of the speech recognition part
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0186624_0186781	do you use that a lot
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0153454_0154048	if you take the l. c. d. screen then you have to stick it on top of the remote control which is pretty much the same thing that you do with a t. v.
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0223687_0224067	oh no
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0058078_0058747	if you pick up the entire package you get a lot of information about the latest trends on what's on the market
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0039137_0039381	but that's a little bit of a problem
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0124992_0125139	it's not too long it's not too short
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0130817_0130921	it needs to be on the left
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0195627_0195904	what they do want the real reaction thing
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0061042_0061259	yeah so you have to lose the curve
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0032977_0033810	you can have an l. c. d. display on it but you can't have a l. c. d. display if you want to make a really a little bit more expensive one
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0180210_0180351	yeah that's just a little extra to keep in mind
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0274539_0274873	and if you want to get the most out of the device that's just the way it has to be done
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0121255_0121388	because that's what you call the double r. c.
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0158716_0158970	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0223959_0224134	twelve and a half
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0002541_0002756	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0018397_0019186	if you have to do that then you have to lose some of your time and i'm not sure if it's worth it
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0104905_0105239	okay just through the l. c. d. screen for example
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0102381_0102717	maybe we lose a little money on the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0158970_0159494	so that's not the only thing that you're looking for is that it's a nice remote right
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0024593_0025389	and you could just take out the little menu that comes up when you click on a menu or something like that because it's not really used in the current remote control
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0093795_0093898	oh
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0212516_0213348	so that's just a little bit of extra on the on the top to make sure that you don't get lost in the screen and stuff like that
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0261426_0262136	well i think it's kind of a cool idea to talk about what we could have done
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0081159_0081352	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0100590_0100987	um so that's just another thing about the some of the extra buttons
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0257021_0257501	okay so we can just pretend we don't have a speech recognition
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0114127_0114868	if we want to do that then it's a little bit of a problem for the twelve and a half euro because we don't want to lose one of the forty percent of the profit on it
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0210971_0211077	it's quite expensive yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0028672_0028802	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0267660_0268069	you mean that you don't lose your remote control sometimes i suppose
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0200922_0201065	um okay
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0169412_0169892	oh yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0004764_0005099	do you like to come to a conclusion
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0189594_0190013	if they like that if they want it like that then we have to make something like that in the next meeting
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0253216_0253648	so that's a pretty straight forward menu if you take out the l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0018522_0018869	yeah i was thinking about anyway that's going to be alright
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0170303_0170774	it should be in a simple form and it's more expensive to do the l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0262837_0263091	if it's like some kind of if people are willing to pay
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0066787_0067293	and then you'd have to make the l. c. d. display on top of it or something like that i guess
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0107270_0107714	shouldn't it be possible to put a cover on top of that or something like that
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0021812_0021965	and there are two they're different options
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0063948_0064594	so it's only a two now or can i lose the l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0255144_0255359	oh no
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0179940_0180210	that's how you call it on the menu
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0251571_0252344	okay um let's see what that would have been if there was no like no menu
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0005698_0005937	it's gonna be a big issue
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0238373_0238569	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0099959_0100154	it doesn't take a lot of time
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0143830_0144030	what's a t. v. d. for anyway
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0050671_0050993	and just make it just an extra option to put on top of the remote control
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0068569_0068860	doesn't doesn't matter
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0111483_0111596	yeah yeah okay yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0221477_0221637	it's a good idea by the way
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0141729_0142205	but at the end of the day it's still a smartboard smartboard that's hard to lose somewhere
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0132245_0132471	do we think about that
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0282773_0282891	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0108922_0109064	but but you
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0121424_0121743	um yeah i think we should just go on with the l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0010769_0011623	um one thing that i noticed is that you use the remote control a lot when you don't want to change channels
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0017486_0018262	um i think it's a good idea to stick with the um the basic design of the remote control that we've come up with so far
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0111938_0112083	well yeah that's true
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0109743_0110080	yeah but you have to spend some time with it before it's a little bit
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0052649_0052811	oh
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0271367_0271506	yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0128257_0128525	let's focus on the user interface first
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0185068_0185739	well maybe we can find out uh what you mean by the curve in the in the design of the remote control
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0265179_0265811	it's just if you drop the l. c. d. screen and you're not using it for a long period of time it starts to lose its function
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0105197_0105814	and i think we should lose the l. c. d. display 'cause they do add too much money to the total cost
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0244908_0245011	okay for the next meeting
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0234538_0234956	it's a nice idea but i don't think it's a lot
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0050422_0050663	so that's just plastic and rubber i suppose
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0236930_0237076	oh
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0199280_0199424	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0176137_0176267	yeah that's true yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0178851_0179386	oh yeah that that's a nice idea
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0162464_0162631	so it's only a one or a two
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0281142_0281256	that's not very meaningful
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0168924_0169280	just a little something to improve the design
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0277640_0277942	it'll be on the top one it'll be on the bottom it'll be in the middle of course
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0099910_0100194	an example of a stupid animal
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0165897_0166317	if you don't use that one then it's not worth the extra money they're offering us
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0196786_0197287	if we're gonna put a little bit of blue in the design then they'll be willing to give us the extra money
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0281067_0281627	uh yeah they're all the same material but sometimes they're different
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0244241_0244628	so do we want an l. c. d. display or maybe this one
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0063054_0063276	we just got a done on the design
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0176403_0176608	but um
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0256480_0256648	but that's what they want i suppose
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0042347_0042747	oh we could do the l. c. d. thing but we don't have that i guess
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0209467_0209594	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0085892_0086548	just uh one of the options is that we take out the l. c. d. menu uh screen
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0091133_0091466	or at least make it a little more uh on top of that
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0247460_0247646	for that
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0269500_0269766	well yeah a curve
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0106173_0106536	you have to lose the l. c. d. screen and you have to lose the menu button
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0233998_0234346	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0060366_0060622	so how how would you like to close that
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0024199_0024593	um solar cells and the double r. c. is also good
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0034863_0035710	um well we want an l. c. d. screen so um if we want an l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0039278_0039458	okay
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0076902_0077102	um i'll just leave that one in there then
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0139748_0140090	maybe you could have done that if we had time though
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0129236_0129671	then you lose the l. c. d. screen which makes it a little bit more expensive
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0117710_0117866	yeah but lose the colours
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0064279_0064838	because if you just make the normal design then it's gonna cost a little bit more
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0140755_0141096	is that going to be a triple curved case or a double curved case
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0046199_0046352	meeting is over
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0089041_0089444	it doesn't work that well when you take out the l. c. d. display anyway
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0119572_0120392	yeah but the the logo is in black and yellow on the on the basic colour scheme of the of the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0117456_0117835	so you mean all buttons do have to be rubber right
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0266434_0267224	which means that you have a lot of space in the l. c. d. display which you use to display some information like channel selection and mute button
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0208257_0208441	so even if it's just a t. v. thing
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0212121_0212516	and that brings us down to the last fifty cents per button
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0214400_0214615	so you see this as a
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0053540_0053686	oh okay meeting ended
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0093287_0093764	yeah i'm gonna be working on a design for the push buttons which are supposed to appear on the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0219180_0219359	okay
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0019778_0020295	the main objective of this meeting is to reach an agreement on the on the final product and the budget
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0121092_0121255	but anyway it's just one way to make money
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0039381_0039876	let's see what the people want
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0197755_0197983	oh the p. m.
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0272761_0273228	yes but you have the l. c. d. remote as well
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0065272_0065398	and i couldn't find out information
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0006711_0006820	okay okay
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0080874_0081304	so and so it's gonna cost us a lot
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0240638_0240914	yeah of course triple r. c.
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0048565_0048700	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0224950_0225317	yeah very good uh nice team work yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0233769_0233929	uh i think a one
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0279167_0279738	but i mean you have the same thing with a normal remote control having a little bit of extra information on it
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0163798_0164155	if you make it like that then you could lose the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0194339_0195069	there's there's a little bit of confusion because you can't lose the cover 'cause they don't give us these special colours
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0190360_0191168	so we lost a little bit of money on the on the on the speech recognition part so that's okay
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0216813_0216963	just a double r. c. m.
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0046899_0047044	yeah that would be either way yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0278040_0278313	okay well that was the only thing that i missed in the meeting actually
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0243115_0243612	okay i'm gonna try to make a little bit more time for this because i didn't do too well in the first time
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0068232_0068607	yeah but you don't make it just like a normal remote control
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0203619_0203867	oh okay alright
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0061027_0061353	the scroll wheel is gonna take up a lot of the space
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0063289_0063528	what we want
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0256003_0256253	goes to the fruit
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0038476_0038941	the only function of the l. c. d. display is uh that you can uh change the text
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0230807_0230954	yeah maybe that's better than the l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0187258_0187797	so maybe that's a problem for the l. c. d. display or a problem for the speech recognition part
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0123539_0123775	we're all gonna have to agree on that at the end of the day
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0240763_0241021	yeah definitely
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0020295_0020877	and so the l. c. d. screen takes up more space than the rest of the remote control anyway
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0057141_0057373	there's there's not enough room for the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0217344_0217656	oh you have uh the name
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0250517_0250815	so if we take a three and a half then that's a little bit of a problem
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0123043_0123539	if it's if it's true or false that you have to draw something which is relevant for the whole world
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0181530_0181646	okay
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0235175_0235508	yeah it's yeah you're right the orange is a nice
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0115184_0115431	well i think it's a little like like the one on top
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0185739_0186339	the only the only thing they have on a remote control is that there's a little logo on it
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0244907_0245123	well we can discuss this if we don't have time right now
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0171385_0171739	the thing is we were thinking about the the way it's going to look like because of the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0159909_0160355	because the l. c. d.'s only for the advanced chip and the voice recognition
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0234696_0234930	oh no that's a yes
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0260376_0260692	uh did we decide what we would do with the l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0091884_0092582	oh it's a two
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0084903_0085417	that's true that it took a lot of time to learn how to work with the d. v. d. c. d. player
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0249187_0249353	okay
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0174408_0174774	and uh the more money you have the more light for the l. c. d. screen and everything
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0136130_0136376	so yeah i put that in there too if possible
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0064838_0065272	the l. c. d. display is just an optional thing you can put on the remote control if you don't have the speech recognition
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0120772_0120979	yeah that's also good because that way we're under the twelve and a half
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0158504_0158755	yeah that's what i'm trying to yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0234025_0234141	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0059029_0059346	and do you agree on the l. c. d. screen or the speech recognition
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0166295_0166492	but it's but it's hard to hold for example
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0163365_0163504	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0070898_0071135	in your in your notebook or on the hard disk
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0237498_0237773	the l. c. d. display is not a part of our original design
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0147621_0147931	well maybe you can show us your new design now
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0188759_0189152	okay but our logo is black and yellow
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0228112_0228471	just put that in the menu and then it'll give you a list of all the possible options
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0016228_0016669	okay so we're all in agreement that we don't want to lose the l. c. d. display for example
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0263091_0263526	um i just don't know if it's not already on my desktop
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0073552_0074028	yeah the menu button you can do that with your l. c. d. display right
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0139344_0139509	to the top of the l. c. d. display
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0283566_0283669	and what time is it
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0027798_0027954	oh what are we doing else
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0272131_0272336	yeah then just skip the speech
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0056071_0056435	but that would that would have been a lot more expensive to incorporate that into the product
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0034053_0034342	um yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0275434_0275852	and um we could look into the possibility of making that on the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0169675_0169803	or a seven
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0273225_0273883	yeah i mean that's exactly what we discussed in the last meeting so it's easy for you to use
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0198418_0198689	but that would break the whole design of the product right
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0005327_0005656	do we have to give the l. c. d. a name
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0135077_0135305	that's what that's what the logo is gonna be
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0048166_0048640	so yeah just like a triangle or something in the middle
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0126975_0127464	but then it has to be a little bit more expensive i think
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0014626_0014856	so you could put the logo there
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0066289_0066787	and then you'd lose the l. c. d. screen and i'm not ready to buy an l. c. d. screen anyway
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0101016_0101819	okay so maybe we could do a little bit more work on the on the design of the remote control and then uh yeah look at the price
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0106555_0106792	yeah we can put the logo on it
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0260692_0260798	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0156222_0157189	it's pretty easy to put the l. c. d. screen in because the l. c. d. is just an extra piece of equipment that needs to be incorporated into the price
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0071077_0071212	yeah i'm gonna pick it up later
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0125328_0125523	but i don't think that would be too much of a problem
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0209821_0210117	yeah that's also a problem with the l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0053919_0054132	if there's enough room for us to do so without losing the budget
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0248940_0249187	oh you're not gonna get out of it
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0050910_0051055	okay
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0091142_0091801	oh yeah but you can't see it on the l. c. d. screen if you don't have an okay button
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0106846_0106986	oh just just a beep
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0224556_0224692	up yeah that's true
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0251379_0251707	you wouldn't no problem with that
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0055903_0056071	yeah if that would be too much yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0168416_0168525	like wha
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0252344_0252592	well wha what about
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0229192_0229367	if they decide to stick with the l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0078233_0078625	probably better to leave the l. c. d. display
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0110675_0110886	uh the only changes are on the channel and volume
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0071212_0071434	wait a little bit for it to come online if it's working properly
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0222777_0223344	and then you get the logo in the middle and it's just the name of the company
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0077311_0077597	so yeah like a two 'cause you have to change the colour
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0090063_0090305	you can do that
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0153109_0153454	but could you could take out the speech recognition thing because it's pretty cheap
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0171103_0171347	and then on top of that add an l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0032689_0032977	that's what you would call it an l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0135734_0135923	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0208271_0208431	but these are all the buttons we have
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0139058_0139344	yeah take out the l. c. d. screen maybe
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0208096_0208257	oh that's a s yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0146883_0147426	so the the logo of the company should be in the front and the slogan should be on the back
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0243877_0244106	we don't have to spend the money on the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0258117_0258709	we make a total profit of twelve and a half euros
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0138521_0138764	the fruit and vegetables concept discussed earlier
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0177584_0178053	yeah which is a little bit uh what did you mean by the double r. c.
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0184522_0184819	oh so that's a bit of a problem
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0021528_0021812	so that's just two euros twenty five centimetres
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0134441_0134649	that's the look and the feeling that people want
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0074114_0074311	yeah yellow or whatever
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0023891_0024199	yeah basically the l. c. d. display
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0172133_0172283	yeah you don't have to draw it yourself
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0182581_0182878	the fruit and the hand dynamo
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0044963_0045399	um that would mean that you'd need um an advanced chip
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0270985_0271210	let's just stick to the l. c. d. screen then
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0211248_0211482	just in the l. c. d. display on the outside
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0014333_0014626	um it has some hidden information in it
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0223369_0224053	we could make it a double r. s triple r. so you don't have to hold it in your hand all the time
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0218657_0218789	we don't want to do too much on it
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0268069_0268282	so you don't have to select the same one
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0070452_0070695	is that the sound or the
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0161604_0161818	yeah i thought that was a possibility too but maybe not
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0259136_0259489	and do you have any more questions
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0082443_0082847	you look at the remote control that they gave us
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0093949_0094239	the whole design of the end now that's all finished
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0271207_0271446	yeah you don't get the l. c. d. screen on the t. v. anyway
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0217753_0218050	are there any other colours on the l. c. d. display
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0283224_0283732	well it's a little bit too much
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0180467_0180583	yeah that's okay
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0282559_0283107	when you take out the l. c. d. display then you have to design a whole remote control with it
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0123775_0124048	so when we lose the l. c. d. screen and you have something like that
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0060622_0061042	do you suppose you would lose the l. c. d. display
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0221530_0222119	yeah i mean you can't say it's not on the l. c. d. screen but you know it's on the remote control
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0254414_0254517	oh
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0107942_0108922	we could use the l. c. d. display but then you would need a lot of extra buttons to do the functions that you want on the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0023131_0023532	what else i have to think about is that the way how it's actually going to work
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0038899_0039180	oh
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0049713_0050140	it's just a little more expensive than the standard model and that makes up for the price
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0078132_0078233	it's not doing too much yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0252439_0252628	we don't we don't need a button for the menu
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0136797_0137361	okay so um yeah the sample sensor and speaker uh went to market
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0198979_0199684	well you just said you don't like the spongy feel
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0234025_0234264	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0059346_0059579	so that's that's the least of these two things
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0099112_0099725	or is it just a little more
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0044474_0044823	and that would be a pretty nice option to include in the l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0021698_0021836	okay yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0118293_0118486	you can do that with the l. c. d. menu on it
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0116003_0116206	just take out the next one i think
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0125539_0126076	it's just a little bit more expensive to have the l. c. d. screen on top of it or something like that
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0036622_0037082	if it's if it's flat then that's a problem
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0117866_0118149	we can do double curve or single curve
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0048700_0048948	okay take out the l. c. d. screen and something like that
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0238946_0239111	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0124688_0124836	next one
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0217831_0217942	it wasn't the choice
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0272813_0273225	well let's just take this off the top of our heads to see if we have enough power to do that
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0118131_0118293	it doesn't have to look like a banana at all
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0140651_0140755	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0201065_0201541	okay well just gonna start with the notes on the last meeting
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0073336_0073698	okay just the one thing that's left out of the list is the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0227367_0227691	but that's just what you could have done with a l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0189349_0189594	if you look if you look at something like this it's pretty interesting
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0188748_0188875	yeah i guess that's your job
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0042122_0042347	the the numbers um
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0218967_0219105	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0192679_0193086	if people are looking for a product which is really like what they expect from a remote control
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0039876_0040167	so then that's all the curve and the l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0112390_0113079	so let's say they take a lot of time to learn how to use a new remote control like i said before
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0271446_0271683	everybody agreed to put it in the l. c. d. display
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0181581_0181729	they got a good chunk of cash in there
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0235208_0235417	rubber is a kind of special colour
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0284081_0284542	but you don't want it to be the final one because it's a little expensive
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0026456_0026737	can we get the l. c. d. on it
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0166492_0166721	if it's a t. v. remote control then the l. c. d. is fine
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0163504_0163648	yeah let's have a party
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0275852_0276514	if you have the l. c. d. screen then there's more room for the l. c. d. screen which is twelve and a half euros
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0012020_0012646	is there a price difference between a regular and a titanium one or is it like the colour difference
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0164659_0164887	that's not a very big issue
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0073206_0073320	if you wanna change my cover
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0121743_0122317	the l. c. d. screen is more expensive than the speech recognition
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0086548_0086820	then um that can be done for free
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0041434_0041734	so this is how this has to look and this is how it's supposed to do
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0036517_0036622	okay
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0150779_0150892	alright
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0176267_0176403	so that's a little unclear
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0253117_0253282	okay well that's a three or a two
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0211482_0211798	and that's just the end of the first meeting
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0260798_0260979	now
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0250894_0251001	we could still take out the curve
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0162977_0163392	yeah but if you if you don't put that then i guess it's not a good idea
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0278907_0279111	and then we stick to the l. c. d. and the speech recognition
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0271210_0271367	if if it doesn't have to
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0097625_0098398	and i would say we took out the l. c. d. and the speech recognition
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0022987_0023159	okay yeah see what i mean
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0282576_0282773	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0275247_0275434	yeah okay that's true
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0240635_0240763	uh
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0111597_0111799	so let's say a two
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0147426_0147543	okay
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0208990_0209204	there's another one on the l. c. d. display itself
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0200295_0200898	let's see what the trends are
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0009745_0009928	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0076547_0076744	yeah i didn't even have a menu in my head
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0201541_0201912	like we could just lose the speech recognition feature or something like that
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0048868_0048973	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0167959_0168230	channel preview and teletext okay
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0062858_0063016	yeah i don't know if that's a problem
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0171523_0171710	you can you can get your email out
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0006355_0006523	oh excellent
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0092912_0093190	still too much time to finish up a paper
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0210615_0211023	and then there's also a little extra space for the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0255501_0255898	oh yeah i mean that's not really an option
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0232844_0233013	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0037768_0038191	so that's all about the l. c. d. display which is still a little bit unclear
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0038941_0039137	just take too much time to build a prototype
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0092196_0092783	it's not a two you know
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0040167_0040336	let's go to the l. c. d. display
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0022709_0023131	and then you can move on to your individual work
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0149507_0149838	three three and a half euros is okay
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0096059_0096200	okay
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0285850_0286022	well we'll discuss it again in a bit longer
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0186339_0186624	what's the use of that
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0283425_0283566	the feel of the
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0225963_0226273	yeah you have yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0234815_0235146	but i think it's it's just a curve in the right place
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0054561_0055144	at the end of the meeting it's important that you put all the minutes in the project documents folder
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0283612_0284081	it would be a little more expensive but it would also increase the weight of the remote
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0142825_0143125	but if we need the menu then we do need the back
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0263885_0264236	uh i think it would have made the l. c. d. screen a little more useful
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0246398_0246596	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0163648_0163764	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0131406_0131880	because i don't have any more information on the l. c. d. display they can tell us
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0062567_0062708	it's too expensive
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0268426_0268832	yeah that would have been a little bit of fun for sure if you sold it for twenty five
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0120470_0120896	but it could be like this but then it turns into a triangle and it's hard to find the menu
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0230290_0230807	yeah that depends on how you look at it depending on what you take into account
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0230146_0230659	let's get out of here and you can go back to your that's the way you're supposed to do it
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0197880_0198070	uh you can have a special colour for it
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0211013_0211248	just the other thing is that we have to do the l. c. d. stuff
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0051769_0052052	just put all the designs on it and go out of existence
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0159488_0159909	yeah but maybe it's a little bit more expensive to stick the speech recognition in there
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0249767_0249998	so i think it's just a little curve on the back
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0238542_0238862	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0204529_0204737	um i don't know
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0110808_0111239	yeah we wouldn't use an l. c. d. screen anyway because we didn't yeah we wanted to save on the money
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0141096_0141729	it's just a little bit more expensive than the standard uh remote control on the on the market
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0181880_0182342	yeah i've got some extra points to yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0154224_0154366	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0222119_0222777	but if you have an l. c. d. screen and the menu button it's a little bit more expensive
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0132988_0133108	well they think it's the working design
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0232000_0232366	looking at some trends about what's popular in the fashion industry and stuff like that
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0169892_0170033	yeah and an l. c. d. can't it
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0226273_0226386	but they don't like that
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0106774_0107296	the only thing you can do on the l. c. d. is that you can select a menu or an option or something like that
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0075818_0076625	because if you want the l. c. d. screen i'm gonna have to use the advanced chip which in turn increases the price by one euro and a half
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0215917_0216096	oh
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0209137_0209471	yeah like a fancy spongy feel
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0068265_0068459	that that's yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0248060_0248216	oh okay
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0053397_0053633	one minute of extra work
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0115580_0116003	well in the end it's up to the look and feel people want what they want on their remote control
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0220271_0220456	but then i guess you have to sell it
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0236408_0237040	one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one like the example in the presentation
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0105794_0105945	that's true
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0242760_0242869	maybe it won't be useful
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0152722_0153001	so you get a nice curve on the on the whole remote control
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0149296_0149507	just a little just a little something extra
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0052052_0052355	and then um you can lose the curve if you want
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0055391_0055574	yeah yeah that would be a big problem
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0134767_0134902	maybe i'll put it in the report
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0148571_0149086	so what we could do with the with the l. c. d. would have like a fancy look
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0206558_0207407	just just to make sure you don't lose them in the couch 'cause they're usually lost somewhere under the couch and you just don't use them as much as you'd like to
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0235508_0235796	it's not like the green on the front and the red on the back
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0271853_0272207	if it's still on the shelf we'll have to open it and put it on the display
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0274879_0275247	well i mean if it's the only thing that's missing
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0048030_0048200	okay that's fine yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0179192_0179324	so or a pineapple
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0284934_0285207	yeah you want to sell it for a little bit of extra money so
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0064551_0064694	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0135328_0135540	yeah i have a lot
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0105945_0106173	the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0134502_0135159	even if there's only one button then even one l. c. d. screen is better
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0015536_0015731	it's not even hard to lose your remote control
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0272981_0273098	yeah have to fill in another one
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0046420_0047031	and it could come up with some more information on the l. c. d. screen and stuff like that
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0149212_0149416	that that's the easy part of it
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0032375_0032689	it's just a speech recognition
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0087588_0088289	so if you do have the l. c. d. screen then we need to see if it's uh if it's enough for us
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0144273_0145030	is it the the design of the remote control is okay but what about the um the ease of making the l. c. d. display
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0177957_0178333	or like all the time or something like that for example
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0164813_0165282	that's that's what you'd put on the side of the box with the the logo on it
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0243694_0243809	yeah i should have to do something about that
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0110080_0110675	the only one is the l. c. d. screen and the speech recognition
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0230954_0231487	so you got a snap shot of the t. v. remote control now
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0244628_0244888	oh i don't know where the real remote is
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0163367_0163566	yeah if you have time maybe
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0081352_0082292	um anyway um there's a hand dynamo for example if you have an l. c. d. display on the t. v.
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0269321_0269500	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0180980_0181393	so that's just a little curve on the on the side of it i guess
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0276282_0276454	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0179683_0179870	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0045889_0046420	so you could take out the l. c. d. display and a speaker
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0168186_0168529	it's not a double curve it's just one curve on the top
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0099725_0099959	alright okay
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0051116_0051305	it's called a logo
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0171222_0171385	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0190013_0190401	they don't get lost in their own house and they can just see the screen on their t. v.
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0287733_0287945	the end
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0033745_0033849	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0225832_0226409	that's the good old t. v. remote control
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0247755_0248019	up down i got a two point two and a half
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0169446_0169675	well i don't know exactly
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0033862_0034307	um i don't know what you can give me
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0128525_0129236	so you see the menu button and the l. c. d. menu button it's not in the same place as the l. c. d. menu button
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0158755_0158866	well do we want it to
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0126392_0126975	so that's just a small yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0219359_0219525	um and the logo
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0014128_0014333	exactly the same thing
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0161982_0162591	that's the end of the day we don't have to
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0037336_0037437	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0170774_0171163	you could make it you could make it a little bit more fancy than that
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0116206_0116826	um all the components are basically the same except for um the colour of the t. r.
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0205884_0206558	so just like i said last time there's a little problem with the l. c. d. 'cause we don't have enough light to power it
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0215327_0215467	yeah that's that's why
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0019186_0019778	because i mean the the the the shape of the remote control is pretty much like what we came up with
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0092582_0093326	see you next time
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0163561_0163750	have to get this done before i can go home i guess
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0246996_0247596	oh well the last time i went to the bar and it's just a lot of stuff on the coffee table
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0082292_0082443	so you don't have a very difficult design
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0034378_0034788	what we decided on is that it's a little bit more expensive than what we initially wanted
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0047239_0047777	so we just lost a little more money than we wanted to on the l. c. d. display
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0028920_0029041	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0220721_0221165	one one two one one one one one one one one one one one one one
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0002306_0002541	is that a scroll wheel
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0170922_0171222	let's not make it a lot more complicated
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0193086_0193671	we could take out the l. c. d. display and just do that like we had planned before
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0228471_0228698	then then then then then then then then then then then
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0234346_0234496	doesn't sound very nice
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0263744_0263885	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0204369_0204625	yes
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0233013_0233294	we'll get another email that will be a lot more detailed on how to do that anyway
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0090860_0091294	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0147533_0147825	so probably a pretty straight forward yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0154203_0154315	the mute button
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0219733_0220248	if you just wanna look at one if you just wanna look at one of them for example it's a little bit more expensive
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0246177_0246362	just add up all the scores
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0178333_0178889	so if you're watching a live t. v. while you're playing with your remote control it's very loud
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0100154_0100590	we're gonna have to lose the l. c. d. display anyway
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0101925_0102381	that's just a little box on top of the remote control with some buttons on it
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0038191_0038361	yes let's see that
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0175023_0175228	it's pretty much just like we talked about before
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0213348_0213571	so that's the the the end of it
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0224134_0224316	but then yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0166254_0166691	yeah but it would be yes if you could
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0157973_0158359	you can just don't you can take out the scroll wheel and just do a normal push button
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0074568_0074831	okay so it's not the only option but a good idea
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0191761_0191972	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0183097_0183243	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0102824_0103036	yeah but oh
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0239916_0240031	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0224692_0224950	yeah i didn't talk about that yet but that's alright
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0076625_0076783	so okay
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0164155_0164659	and that would make the whole idea of the whole idea of the remote control uh very good
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0262136_0262837	because it's just not really giving us the information that we need to find out if the product is good or bad or something like that
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0179709_0179940	but if you get that in the design of the product itself
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0257501_0258117	so we decided to put the speech recognition and the l. c. d. display on the on the spongy part
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0155341_0156222	the the most expensive part of the thing is the l. c. d. screen which has to be a little bit bigger
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0283154_0283256	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0276627_0277014	and um something a little more spongy than that
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0198070_0198284	can i have a special colour for the l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0255215_0255501	oh you just said it's a new trend
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0214615_0215164	just go here and just go here and it's going to be yellow
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0169280_0169446	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0080297_0080874	just one question for the l. c. d. uh that's what we want on the on the remote control
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0043546_0044062	and you take it take it to a meeting and say okay this is a nice piece of technology
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0219563_0219865	just like you say point one curve or something like that
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0269767_0270631	or you could just do it on the on the l. c. d. screen if you really need to get out of here
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0198689_0199005	oh
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0251148_0251339	well it won't make a lot of noise anyway
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0219105_0219240	still not drop the banana
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0049850_0049965	okay i see
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0205023_0205757	oh no i didn't have any new information about what's supposed to be on the l. c. d. display anyway
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0237040_0237498	okay um that's gonna give you an idea of what the buttons look like
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0238633_0239098	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0115106_0115222	just maybe you know
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0072240_0072566	so it's a total of two and a half
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0129671_0130137	and on this one you can see that i made all the designs and then we'll decide on which one we want
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0111723_0111938	at least they know what it means
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0086820_0087170	well i'm just looking at what you have to do with the design of the remote control anyway
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0146533_0146683	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0094447_0094830	well you just pick up the phone and now it's a one point no problem
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0068459_0068569	the teletext
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0178889_0179192	at least that's a problem to overcome
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0207992_0208211	probably some sort of r. c.
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0109368_0109743	you have to go into the advanced settings and it's a little bit confusing if you don't know how to use it
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0142205_0142825	yeah so if you just look at the remote control it's pretty much straight forward to do what you want to do
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0256031_0256612	mechanism
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0238898_0239158	okay i didn't know
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0196265_0196481	um do we save the presentation
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0217863_0218569	yeah but if they make a cover on the on the l. c. d. screen then it's not okay anymore
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0204803_0204956	yeah we could give it a yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0268462_0268812	yeah and for in that sense for speech recognition yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0128626_0128741	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0150892_0151721	the l. c. d. screen is just not gonna be able to do that because we don't have a way to integrate the l. c. d. display
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0049571_0049713	it's not an advanced chip though
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0215164_0215514	and then you have to start all over again from the first one
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0062005_0062172	okay alright
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0242119_0242579	do we wanna make an l. c. d. uh display on the on the end yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0079543_0080115	so yeah that's um well that's a little less than okay
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0195177_0195627	um yeah but just like i mentioned in the last email
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0192304_0192679	like we just talked about in the last meeting that we don't need a lot of extra stuff on it
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0163566_0163798	that would be a nice way to do it yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0122317_0123043	but if we make the l. c. d. then it's not really that much of a problem because i think the l. c. d. is in the menu button
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0269326_0269623	uh well we should just try to find more information on the costs
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0168529_0168814	um i don't know
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0250776_0250894	or we could just find out
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0067308_0067648	so when we lose the menu button it's not
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0018262_0018397	yeah not really
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0036935_0037078	probably not too much i think
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0090239_0090431	okay
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0114868_0114978	take the money out of them then
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0093764_0093949	so that we can fill in later on
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0143503_0144032	you have to think of that
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0091738_0092049	okay
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0124307_0124688	make the logo on the remote control instead of on the t. v.
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0075690_0075818	well just just tell me
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0224883_0225023	how much is it over twelve and a half
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0067637_0068265	but maybe if you could just put it in the menu and then you can do what you want with the with the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0237773_0237959	it's it's pretty cool
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0256898_0257262	if we don't have any more money then we lose the l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0055128_0055476	can you pick up the pen and put it somewhere else
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0100149_0100733	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0015854_0016228	you don't have to do anything with the buttons before they're needed
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0151946_0152612	but we don't have the hand dynamo so we can't talk about it in the in the commercial part
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0134649_0134767	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0045399_0045889	you say one point two that's a little bit of something you want to put in your speech recognition
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0165013_0165350	yeah i think the l. c. d. is quite a compromise
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0267224_0267660	and then you just make a new one that's the same as the last one but with different colours
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0052811_0053116	is it is the curve for the easy part
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0252792_0252904	five is better than three anyway
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0016668_0016786	oh no
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0119318_0119664	so it's going to be a little bit longer on the design side because we wanted to do that
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0091294_0091408	it's an extension
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0240396_0240635	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0204219_0204433	oh yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0232469_0232617	the front and the spongy thing
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0259873_0260094	but um it should be fine
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0234609_0234815	just yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0239583_0240106	it's a an example of uh technical innovation
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0012507_0012860	um i think there is
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0263546_0263744	oh i think it would
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0226386_0226994	you have to s you have to push a button that's not already on the menu so that's a little bit of a problem
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0038361_0038476	so i'm gonna make a summary
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0241021_0241212	oh not great
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0224316_0224556	oh i don't know it's not true
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0236191_0236358	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0276454_0276627	which is exactly the same
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0171408_0171523	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0227069_0227251	yeah that's true
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0138033_0138314	so how do we have the l. c. d. in it
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0091466_0092196	yeah me neither
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0114980_0115106	but why do we need a double r.
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0254982_0255215	is that clear enough
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0026979_0027329	like when you take out a piece of paper and write something on it that doesn't look like that
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0089444_0090063	if you if you take a look in the menu it's it's a little bit difficult to find out which channel you're on
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0261428_0261548	it would be nice in the end
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0113546_0114127	if you make it a little bit thicker then we're gonna lose the l. c. d. screen anyway
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0216266_0216811	um i'm not entirely sure about how to put all the information in it
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0060036_0060147	oh
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0020877_0021528	so the l. c. d. screen takes up a bit more space than the speech recognition and the the menu button
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0074427_0074693	did i did i just draw it in the middle or something
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0191168_0191313	well that's one of my findings
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0059579_0060210	you have to look at the latest trends on how people want their remote controls to look and how they want them to feel in the in the spongy stuff
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0148152_0148272	oh no
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0105814_0106146	and that's the one that you get on the left side of the screen when you talk to the remote control
AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0003721_0003846	okay
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0050663_0050813	yeah
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0199424_0199910	yeah yeah that's okay
AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0018339_0018522	okay i'll do that
AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0185916_0186115	oh
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0143082_0143247	okay
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0181663_0182241	just take out the speech recognition and you can programme in your favourite channel or something
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0058705_0058934	all all lights are a one or a two
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0130510_0130868	you need to lose the l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0122613_0122772	do we make it a one or a two
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0154007_0154164	final design presentation later on
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0061732_0062279	so just just take this one as an example for the l. c. d. display and i'll just say that's a one point six
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0127956_0128207	yes
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0014843_0015002	so um yeah that's true
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0130181_0130389	maybe it's only gonna be an hour anyway
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0033821_0034404	yeah i didn't put it in there because it's really a little bit of a problem with the l. c. d. screen to be honest
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0094723_0094995	yeah i think you have to give it a name first and then it's alright
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0077673_0078155	um i just have to make sure there's enough space for the l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0018749_0018957	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0086606_0086931	the only thing i could think of was the colour
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0027218_0027489	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0080798_0081025	it's like you have to find out for yourself
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0214288_0214589	well it's okay but i'll take this into consideration
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0079280_0079699	well i suppose it's um the l. c. d. is useful
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0040120_0040237	oh yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0193337_0193727	well just like if we take a little bit more time for the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0211992_0212200	but it didn't really look like an elephant
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0089864_0090401	we don't have a lot of money so we can't make it very expensive or something like that
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0097654_0098357	maybe you have a l. c. d. display on your remote control and just show us how much money we saved
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0205438_0205932	yeah yeah i mean if you have like that it's like a
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0137988_0138094	if you press the five
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0163258_0164252	we can we have an l. c. d. display which is more expensive than i mean that's yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0112103_0112218	yeah exactly
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0111155_0111299	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0205767_0205902	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0208316_0209096	we don't have a lot of buttons on the l. c. d. screen so we're not gonna be able to display all the numbers
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0044253_0044625	it's not done on a scale of seven to ten anyway
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0100849_0100972	okay
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0112911_0113066	yeah that's true
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0044653_0045256	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0150594_0150724	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0043909_0044253	okay
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0039715_0040133	but let's stick to the double r. so that's not too bad
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0012207_0012328	let's see what the problem is
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0214959_0215201	so i don't think we'll lose it anyway
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0115201_0115311	let's get started
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0160131_0160714	exactly what do you think about the l. c. d. screen if people don't like that
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0195571_0195821	and if we can yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0028244_0028456	has to have anything to do with time as well
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0148058_0148276	uh it's just for the menu if you have a sub menu
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0038566_0038773	yeah i think it looks a little bit like banana already
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0143567_0143766	everybody knows what i've just said
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0062279_0062926	and you could make the l. c. d. screen on top of the remote control if you had a little extra space in the menu or something like that
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0040229_0040610	so i think it's not like one curve in the middle or something like that
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0093153_0093342	just a basic colour is okay
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0131310_0131482	maybe have a power button
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0153143_0153293	oh i have to make this off the top of my head
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0138306_0139183	um we have the one thing that we didn't like in the in the last presentation is the amount of money
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0209491_0209673	yeah the yellow ball also
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0043889_0044535	yeah that's true
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0146247_0146629	maybe we should aim for the design to be in within budget
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0136947_0137425	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0125814_0126195	and you'll get the same email as we all did today anyway
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0007291_0007454	yeah let's just make it a number then
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0173882_0174181	and i don't know if you can do it on a l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0108360_0109058	but i think it's a little bit of colour is better than black anyway
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0141775_0142184	it's not a good idea but that's fine
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0026667_0026774	okay
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0068205_0068504	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0142418_0142656	well it wasn't entirely obvious actually
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0206489_0206636	well it makes it kind of
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0118486_0118681	and i mean we could do that in a little bit like this
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0140242_0140610	um maybe for the evaluation i would give a one
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0182533_0182797	because the trends are pretty close to the current trends
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0207760_0207915	we are still talking about our design
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0031119_0031314	yeah i mean
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0126228_0126447	so so let's see what the budget is supposed to be
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0169404_0169517	well i will i will
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0210871_0211092	if you look if you look at our competitors in this market
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0123383_0123515	but um
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0089082_0089224	oh no
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0025643_0025952	these are all kind of high tech things which aren't really on our list
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0027476_0027982	it's just a little bit more expensive than the normal remote control you have to buy
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0027116_0027389	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0032835_0033593	um but if it's a remote control then you don't have to sell it
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0025310_0025643	they have they have a lot of the stuff that they don't really use anymore
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0023032_0023273	yeah i guess that's up to you then since it's the l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0209740_0209951	okay
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0174744_0175073	take that into consideration when you're making the design of the remote control
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0145965_0146120	it's a good yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0146629_0146885	yeah okay but we need both l. c. d. display
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0023621_0024047	just just don't do that
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0118504_0118703	and could be expensive
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0083604_0084156	one one i have a little more information that we can work with than just a regular remote control
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0035151_0035394	so i don't take it for a straight forward design
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0165915_0166112	so i don't think
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0086848_0086949	yeah i know
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0189484_0190231	because if you have an l. c. d. display on it you don't have a lot of space so maybe we lose the l. c. d. display anyway
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0017470_0017772	yeah the front is kind of
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0151464_0151692	okay
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0063541_0063654	oh you didn't know that you could not
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0055107_0056001	and after that the menu button and the delete button which makes it easy to navigate through all the menus in the l. c. d. display
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0211507_0211992	um i'd like to take a quick look at the agenda for today
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0150359_0150594	never mind i'm not even aware of that
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0069674_0070291	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0151432_0151652	it's a p yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0069241_0069415	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0097278_0097652	oh no
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0073526_0073733	so i'll just write that down
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0078493_0078683	let's see what you can do with that
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0151929_0152096	okay
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0091278_0092182	oh
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0048815_0049448	so i think it's a one for the l. c. d. display because it was the most important thing in the design
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0046770_0046985	but it's just you're going a bit out of your way
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0026083_0026667	oh it's a rabbit
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0090402_0090808	um any additional ideas you have come up with
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0210340_0210705	or something like that you can't do because we don't have the special colour on it
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0019388_0019671	oh just make the black and red a little bit
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0130067_0130510	so yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0129539_0129786	then you will have the special form
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0154502_0154676	oh no you can't
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0088236_0089082	yeah that would be good
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0110038_0110335	roo
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0038021_0038352	it's not it's not a lot of stuff on the t. v. anyway
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0103034_0103425	we'll see what the next meeting will bring
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0162181_0162365	it's gonna be a problem
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0082282_0082406	yeah that doesn't matter
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0066256_0066714	just one thing about the l. c. d. display i don't think it's very expensive to implement
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0212200_0212531	it's it's not like a spongy remote control that's just rubber
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0097451_0097610	can we save the documents now
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0006588_0006734	okay
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0057447_0057616	um i don't want to do something like that
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0080298_0080635	yeah i'm not sure about that but it did take a lot of time in the end
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0050682_0050792	well i don't know what they mean by that
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0104744_0105104	like to throw the left right up and down button like this
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0040968_0041094	okay that's enough
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0187847_0187994	um height yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0091487_0091840	some people don't wanna pay for an l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0047380_0047894	the l. c. d. and the titanium on the on the on the double r. c. m.
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0042029_0042437	up and down has to have an l. c. d. display because i don't have enough space on the l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0004900_0005215	oh
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0002063_0002511	of the future i guess
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0218498_0218791	just make it a one or a two
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0183290_0183584	that was a lot of pain
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0143624_0143738	okay the logo
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0218791_0218984	but i think that's what we gotta do
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0205710_0205844	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0207310_0207511	so that's not our logo or anything like that
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0069235_0069446	oh right
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0144807_0144937	because then it's not
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0194615_0195308	well the remote control that you saw last time um we're not going for the l. c. d. display
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0007053_0007312	okay
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0153647_0153757	yeah twenty five euros
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0169906_0170600	well i would give it a one because you will lose the l. c. d. in your in your remote control
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0043448_0043867	well can you hand it over to me so that we can see what's on the remote control
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0034404_0034674	that's the that's the top of the graph and you get it down to a single curve
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0174429_0174744	that's that's the light part of it
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0190932_0191506	because you don't get any new information when you go back and forth between pages or something like that anyway
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0210701_0210871	oh no it won't be a problem
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0188570_0188695	is it the trendy part of the cover
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0083101_0083343	so that's a two
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0051370_0051605	um and the other thing is um
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0201930_0202490	just take that just take out the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0085342_0085510	yeah we'll have something else
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0026982_0027116	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0044972_0045397	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0032314_0032693	well i mean like you can't lose a remote control if you take out the covers right
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0117920_0118139	that's something to keep in mind of course
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0178574_0178779	how does that work on the l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0058348_0058783	so just only on the l. c. d. screen you see all your information
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0024183_0024302	but i don't see it like that
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0021506_0022321	so i think that's a good compromise 'cause there was just too much money to make
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0185645_0185769	you could take that out first
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0154016_0154252	we're planning a black and white remote control anyway
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0065511_0066137	um and then we have a second one which is a little bit more expensive
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0164008_0164164	seven and a half
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0179185_0179812	looks like it's just one curve where you hold the l. c. d. display right
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0036835_0037111	but that's not a big deal
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0028945_0029123	uh i reckon it's a good idea
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0072533_0072653	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0036363_0036835	it's not the only thing the only thing is the the spongy stuff
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0067023_0067170	one two three four five six seven eight
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0110371_0110848	we don't have much more information on them than just the standard material
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0151652_0152009	oh no that's not a problem
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0017545_0017761	it's just it's a little less expensive i guess
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0165717_0166013	yeah that could be like a feature that you could add later yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0206073_0206264	yeah but did you talk about that already
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0122211_0122354	oh we'll try to do that
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0098687_0098797	if you have
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0202466_0202569	to start from the first
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0210998_0211183	but if i can yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0206444_0206625	but
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0135769_0136076	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0026232_0026377	how's our cost over there
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0157274_0157747	is that is that a part of the design or is that a part of the information that we received
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0097588_0097750	that's not a problem
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0178969_0179185	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0027366_0027487	yeah that's an yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0096153_0096712	oh it's an interesting design but you don't see the l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0088088_0088254	supplementing my design
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0043872_0044186	but
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0220281_0220403	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0141076_0141216	oh that's no problem
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0100972_0101247	um let's let's look this one
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0025952_0026083	they didn't know that i was the first one
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0118703_0118805	exactly
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0087458_0087887	that's what i have to say for now
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0106975_0107255	well maybe i'll try
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0175946_0176441	so that was the one thing i'm trying to work out is um what's the difference between a simple and a double
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0073946_0074059	and the smartboard is lost
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0133975_0134636	that's like yeah that's like the l. c. d. screen on a t. v. where you can look at here and there
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0100450_0100612	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0142694_0142974	well it's on the side anyway i suppose
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0217585_0217717	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0056001_0056677	and we'll give you a special colour for the l. c. d. screen and that will go along with your product as well
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0148916_0149051	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0109005_0109126	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0031013_0031119	oh maybe it's well
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0113883_0114458	so did we have a design for the l. c. d. display and sound
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0059782_0060580	but if you take a look in the in the menu structure we have an idea of how it would be displayed in a digital display
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0076024_0076748	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0040826_0040967	yeah this is no
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0131482_0131772	so maybe that's a little bit of a problem in our evaluation anyway
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0174233_0174429	it doesn't do anything yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0216482_0217203	let's see what we'll take with the l. c. d. screen and without the speech recognition anyway
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0162406_0162725	oh it's pretty much the same as all the other telephones
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0187994_0188550	well i mean if you have a high end high quality remote control like this one how much does it cost
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0080103_0080384	it's just a plain old remote control
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0118139_0118504	that's that's more than fifty percent
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0132102_0132203	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0166261_0166473	maybe just put 'em on a cover
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0099842_0099951	it's from somewhere else
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0135096_0135215	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0203017_0203143	yellow and yellow logo yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0050983_0051183	let's see what there is um
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0090954_0091434	did we make a decision on the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0004996_0005368	oh it's a stupid animal
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0148522_0148694	uh-huh
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0204919_0205171	to give you a good idea about the l. c. d. display
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0109484_0109629	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0016966_0017340	um basically there's a lot of new features going on
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0041480_0041897	um well the l. c. d. screen is pretty cool
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0091917_0092258	okay we can just fill in a little bit
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0126933_0127272	yeah that's fine i had some problems with it anyway
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0150022_0150518	beep beep beep
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0018272_0018612	but you still need to take out the l. c. d. screen and all the buttons on it
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0191550_0191944	oh yeah this is this is all the stuff that we put in for the l. c. d. display
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0193267_0193395	but how do you manage it
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0130060_0130210	yeah that's true
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0085510_0085735	just a little bit more like a boxy design
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0038183_0038603	if you make it a little bit thicker in the middle if you lose your remote control
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0015416_0015672	so there will be a possibility to lose the l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0197295_0197410	if it can't
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0002952_0003133	but rubber
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0156649_0156753	we should have done it anyway
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0110304_0110440	it's a little bit more expensive
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0008509_0008640	oh
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0087488_0088107	oh that would be nice
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0039372_0039778	we can't add an extra one right
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0133554_0133668	twenty five
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0135407_0135572	it's not
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0084666_0084871	like in that uh
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0142276_0142587	that's not a good idea i think
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0081562_0081701	yeah i'm just gonna check now
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0140752_0140882	is it twenty five
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0088280_0088700	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0155338_0155536	even in a random location it's fine
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0024880_0025008	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0075358_0075462	okay right
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0069860_0070409	that that's a good idea
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0192057_0192623	do we have a lot of time left for the last part of the meeting because we're supposed to finish up in thirty minutes
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0124769_0124899	maybe it's just a little too much
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0127272_0127400	um you think the numbers
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0054120_0054797	well i think that's just the the way you make a remote control that fits into your living room or whatever you want to do with it
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0209132_0209233	okay
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0057819_0058348	so if we have the colour of the l. c. d. screen uh we don't have a lot more to lose on that
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0145491_0145868	that's just the other way around you talk about
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0018894_0019151	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0137769_0137988	um yeah but then if you change the colours
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0067300_0067832	oh
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0114977_0115151	okay
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0054020_0054141	like something like this
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0136194_0136389	yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0100254_0100450	yes
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0133368_0133554	like i think it's not a trend
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0059149_0059684	yeah i mean do you think it would be a good idea if we d if we didn't make it yellow
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0021504_0021700	oh i hate rubber
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0103314_0103778	and i'm not sure if we got enough stuff to put into the budget for that anyway
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0120589_0120727	and that would go with the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0149456_0149558	okay that's the only one
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0190572_0190694	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0144673_0144807	we should definitely implement that
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0125261_0125430	well do we all agree on the material
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0074059_0074781	so if you have something like that on the l. c. d. screen and there's also some extra information on it
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0203575_0203798	you can just save everything at the moment
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0207919_0208441	yeah we still have to make it a little bit more durable than the normal remote controls out there
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0012988_0013625	did i take out your presentation or did you take out my presentation
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0025312_0025661	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0148526_0148668	exactly me too
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0126709_0126933	you would make it an l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0050792_0050952	blue and white that's your name
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0064597_0064749	yeah yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0124267_0124755	that's why i don't think that's the way we're aiming for at least in this one anyway
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0117427_0117920	yeah okay but we can lose the l. c. d. display if we want to save just one euro for example
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0140712_0140962	that's that's the r i think it's alright for the r. c.
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0207511_0207760	like we don't lose the l. c. d. screen anyway
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0159599_0160018	how many people are you going to have for each piece anyway
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0144408_0144537	uh i wouldn't wanna do that
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0145641_0145965	yeah that's a good product it's a good product
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0043276_0043666	but i don't see how it has to look like a banana if it's on top of the remote control
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0033643_0033841	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0141119_0141248	thirteen and a half
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0170935_0171105	um i guess i'll open that
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0108805_0109267	it's a good idea
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0164978_0165201	just to finish the design and yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0013625_0014060	yeah i mean i didn't take the l. c. d. screen into consideration
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0121032_0121596	oh yeah you have a rabbit
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0067986_0068106	there's a good balance for this
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0176802_0177381	well this is the end of the day i guess
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0149671_0149979	oh we have a three
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0054797_0055107	you give it a name and then you put the voice recognition into it
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0110848_0111427	so you just say like this and i'll take it right away
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0035525_0035715	yeah let's see where the money is
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0202278_0202422	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0084638_0084829	you know that
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0202681_0202785	up to forty seconds
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0126563_0126708	should you make it a three then
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0017761_0018272	um it's just you know if you look at the l. c. d. screen it's it's a little bit more expensive
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0165633_0165800	that's kind of a good price to pay
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0036863_0037115	that's just a little extra on top of the
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0162302_0162513	oh we have a long meeting
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0157128_0157274	oh yeah of course but
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0167850_0168296	and when i went back to my uh home and did this
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0150813_0151225	and you must have a presentation as well
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0004201_0004336	so that's gonna be a problem
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0060580_0061211	but the black and white is more like a normal t. v. remote control than the ones that you find in the market today
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0094287_0094388	just in the menu button
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0105104_0105252	so we're going to lose the l. c. d. in it
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0132751_0132990	so maybe it's kind of handy to draw here
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0209151_0209429	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0109808_0110031	okay did you finish the agenda for today's meeting
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0139417_0139544	two and a half
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0219012_0219251	oh we can even lose the l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0147364_0147545	okay then um yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0103900_0104113	people want to lose their information
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0075513_0075642	well it's not really a curve anyway
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0195308_0195571	and we'll just stick to the double r. l. c. d. one then
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0130680_0130898	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0095345_0095469	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0014324_0014843	yeah i'm just like you said yeah it's pretty much the same thing if you have a lot of buttons on it
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0078503_0078649	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0081261_0081362	but i can save it anyway
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0059504_0059733	well if we just eliminate the extra features
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0019753_0020065	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0025008_0025238	it's time
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0031056_0031237	so it's just not a really good design
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0030007_0030205	but just don't put it in the colours then
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0163144_0163258	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0069679_0069860	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0112756_0112904	uh looking at the stuff we had to work with
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0052391_0052733	yeah that's a little bit
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0027676_0027902	yeah exactly
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0119597_0120310	but i think we'll be able to do without the l. c. d. screen anyway because we didn't design it ourselves
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0063146_0063342	but but it should still take up a lot of space i think
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0108083_0108360	perhaps this could be done through the l. c. d. screen actually
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0209642_0209821	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0015672_0016188	so um taking out the l. c. d. screen and the speech recognition on top of it
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0152163_0152341	um so um
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0188848_0188969	because this is difficult
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0202490_0202650	because um
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0082941_0083101	the l. c. d. display is it working like this
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0120899_0121052	yeah that's true
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0157793_0158247	now we need to make a decision on the product that we want to produce
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0200307_0200435	it has to be
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0200435_0200738	that's just the rubber i don't have any more
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0148594_0149073	it's a little bit like if you have it like this
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0015002_0015254	so that was the main thing that i missed out in the last time
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0074781_0075165	so they don't take up a lot of the place that we put the the the logo on the back of the product
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0123133_0123383	well still have to pick up my phone before i can talk to you
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0185971_0186525	so if you have the l. c. d. display then that means that we lose the um the sound of it
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0132565_0132750	so a white rabbit in a l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0052411_0052523	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0212531_0212781	so it's it's basically the opposite of the l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0076880_0077078	um
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0099902_0100259	okay so that's a little bit of a waste of space i guess
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0096156_0096516	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0095198_0095345	yeah just take out the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0127010_0127175	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0156342_0156473	yeah that
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0137207_0137686	yeah that's true
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0081863_0082071	we could put it in a in a special colour
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0209408_0209642	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0136592_0136905	and i don't want one
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0034674_0034783	it's a yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0118805_0119034	it's just a trend yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0027357_0027476	it's a problem yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0095016_0095251	so it's all about the design of the remote control itself
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0052538_0052702	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0072044_0072846	so basically the main idea is that we take out the l. c. d. display and replace it with a speech recognition module
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0082410_0082679	maybe i just don't need to explain what the different buttons do
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0104113_0104744	because if we make the l. c. d. display like this then we need to make a lot of extra money which is more than our budget
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0039518_0039783	but
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0176699_0177347	yeah so there's a lot of space for the l. c. d. because you have yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0100744_0100849	oh no
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0132950_0133165	so like i think it's not really fancy
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0125430_0125786	so we don't have to put it on the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0134790_0135144	then you can make a menu on the l. c. d. display for example
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0195663_0195780	oh let me see what i mean
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0038603_0038718	but
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0121052_0121445	yeah i've done my part of the project evaluation
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0135848_0136057	one one and a half
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0039504_0039938	oh
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0149119_0149585	well i had a lot more time for this than the last night actually
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0203393_0203597	that's that's it's quite straight forward
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0164252_0164518	we could just add a plastic cover
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0189392_0189561	if we could just have an l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0059098_0059276	okay double r. c.
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0209233_0209491	all the l all the black and yellow
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0063991_0064404	so you can just go to the menu and then you have the list of all the programmes that you like
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0112554_0112756	let's just let's make it a little bit more easy to use
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0076813_0076935	the d
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0022410_0023001	it doesn't have anything to do with the l. c. d. but it's just a little bit of extra money that they don't have
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0101446_0102253	it's a little bit more expensive than the standard remote control if you want to add something on top of it
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0100305_0100661	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0129630_0130067	like they don't pay extra for like a special colour or something like that
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0011917_0012147	oh no
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0180420_0180825	just like in the first one then just take out the l. c. d. screen and put it in
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0097042_0097588	the meeting will be over in a minute
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0116565_0116699	yeah think of a brand yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0114458_0115163	yeah that's true but we took out the l. c. d. thing so i don't see it
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0147092_0147205	oh right
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0024270_0024714	guess what's going on for your presentation if you have some time left
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0118798_0118957	and make it up to that
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0210877_0210998	with the uh
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0214589_0214771	but
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0052876_0053288	because there's a lot of information on the internet now and some new channels have come up
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0124630_0124769	and the menu
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0079699_0080103	like for example we have l. c. d. display and speech recognition in it
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0109501_0109808	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0190231_0190333	then it could curve like this
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0094007_0094383	yeah yeah yeah i don't know if you have to put it here or not
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0202772_0202979	yeah because you don't have the sample sensor in it
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0052095_0052411	yeah they don't say that the l. c. d. screen you can put it somewhere else
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0152986_0153581	well this is just an example of what i drew
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0057267_0057447	but i can't see that
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0142163_0142403	easy to use ten yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0129220_0129630	uh they they don't give you a name
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0115809_0115932	the m um
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0084289_0084638	well you can't hold that in your hand
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0129674_0129833	yeah i know but
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0052524_0052865	yeah it's pretty hard to
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0109184_0109734	it's an advanced chip uh in fact
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0066714_0067023	they don't have that much time on their side anyway
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0051559_0051733	well it's kinda boring yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0120308_0120594	yeah the more than that
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0133528_0133914	okay and then the l. c. d. display will have to wait a little bit
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0143446_0143624	the rubber yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0206507_0207067	oh no i mean it's not a problem but maybe it's uh
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0033537_0033821	oh i didn't have a look
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0020970_0021307	exa exa except the l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0015254_0015416	just make it a little bit more curved on the edges
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0114513_0115039	it's a cheap design
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0109126_0109300	project document
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0089751_0089873	yeah anything like that
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0038773_0039024	the l. c. d. is just a new way of communicating
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0107864_0108008	let's
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0087619_0087884	oh alright
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0197254_0197407	yes yes
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0127630_0127793	yeah right
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0033675_0033797	good
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0011754_0011982	um no okay
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0082679_0082941	doesn't matter
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0155756_0155884	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0195821_0196372	so if you want it to be a little bit more fancy then we'll have to drop the l. c. d. screen anyway
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0092623_0092786	well i'll have to make an example of that
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0169604_0169952	so i'm gonna draw you to the meeting room
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0133263_0133368	me neither
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0098936_0099810	and if you want to use the l. c. d. display you have to spend more than twelve and a half euros on the remote control
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0150257_0150782	because i don't have anything else at the moment except the basics
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0139544_0139677	so it's two two to three
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0135305_0135407	oh sorry
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0197407_0197508	exactly
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0005140_0005279	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0141500_0141952	okay that's enough for a general feeling
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0188300_0188413	oh just the l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0059359_0059504	yeah it doesn't really matter now
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0199631_0199794	like it just
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0132330_0132565	that might be a good thing i think
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0018957_0019079	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0209246_0209408	exactly
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0120773_0120899	to work on it once again
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0139766_0140033	have we done enough to have the l. c. d. display
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0126439_0126709	oh well that's still the end of my report
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0030441_0031056	just put it in the l. c. d. screen and let's see if it's worth the extra expense just for the display anyway
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0041310_0041492	it's not that expensive
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0023775_0024183	oh it's just a curve
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0130370_0130504	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0209821_0209934	yeah that would be nice
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0111299_0112231	and it's just gonna be a little bit of extra design work to put on top of the basic remote control because you don't want it to get lost in your living room
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0026882_0026983	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0081701_0081885	maybe think of something for the extra f. c.
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0075165_0075639	just just to get an idea of how it's gonna look like in a completely new design
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0141791_0141925	is that a good rating or bad
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0045916_0046646	so you see that it takes a lot of space when you take out the l. c. d. screen and then it's it's pretty much the same
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0016188_0016478	so that's that's a one at least
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0017772_0017917	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0016478_0016680	so um yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0125070_0125180	maybe i'll put it in the report
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0019703_0020121	deeper in the p. c. yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0049448_0050088	up and down are basically the same except that some t. v. s don't support l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0184682_0185363	and then you look at the menu and um that's a lot of buttons on it which we didn't want in our design
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0179927_0180420	if you have a little bit of money in your pocket that you want to make a profit
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0056677_0057267	yeah but you have to build in the speech recognition and the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0091434_0092082	so
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0097092_0097278	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0019391_0019703	you just take out the p. c.
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0182347_0182533	it's not difficult
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0155209_0155380	so so it's a two point five
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0068407_0068548	so you don't wanna yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0142656_0143082	so yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0035556_0035682	yeah give it a
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0137628_0137769	oh that's good
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0148276_0148594	for me personally i'm going to make a pretty much straight forward one
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0029599_0030007	uh the advanced chip is in a little bit out of range
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0144537_0144643	but we should check on that
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0202422_0202634	let's it's absolutely fantastic
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0025012_0025312	yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0203227_0203393	so yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0011420_0012024	that was an option
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0047894_0048815	but i don't think that's something that they're talking about on the on the other side of the market is that um there are some some some some things like the l. c. d. and the voice recognition
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0034811_0035151	but i thought it was just more difficult to learn how to draw the things that you wanted
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0096698_0096891	oh yes
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0105967_0106108	it's not working anymore
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0192899_0193337	let's just make the l. c. d. screen a little smaller on top of the remote control
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0158872_0159599	how about you guys have a basic idea of how the project is going
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0020309_0020675	there is a double r. for the l. c. d. display
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0064997_0065404	yeah just a little bit of yellow on top to give it a trendy feel
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0046985_0047241	is it good enough to use as a cover
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0171732_0172201	just um just a little bit of design to make it pretty pretty on the outside
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0027076_0027357	yeah that's a good idea but i think it's about the same as you said
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0031602_0032314	there's there's an l. c. d. display which is one of the more expensive but that's alright
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0031314_0031602	yeah i think there's there's a there's a way to lose the l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0191944_0192057	if we're looking for a little bit of design
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0198555_0199395	um just to give you a little summary of the project it's supposed to be a remote control for t. v. s
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0173159_0173266	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0193727_0194086	we're looking for the latest and greatest trends in the world of electronics
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0127211_0128210	okay we need an l. c. d. screen and um the l. c. d. screen is too expensive
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0026400_0026858	oh i think it's a curve
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0107140_0107443	if you make it a little bit wider then
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0006734_0007677	if it's possible i don't see any problems with the l. c. d. screen anyway
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0024953_0025451	oh
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0068535_0068751	yeah see that's basically what you get with speech recognition
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0063654_0063991	so it's c so the speaker recognition is gonna take up a lot of space because you have to s
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0092316_0092511	well let's see if you finish it in time then
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0123949_0124267	or we could make an l. c. d. display on it but i'm not sure
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0205569_0205767	that's what you mean yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0129224_0129346	it's pretty hard to find
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0162887_0162990	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0209934_0210340	yeah but maybe if we have an l. c. d. screen in it anyway i mean
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0036931_0037073	yeah i know
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0085748_0086228	oh no you mean something else right
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0053288_0053572	um well has come up
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0157584_0157793	yeah yeah yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0137425_0137628	to the four
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0211183_0211507	yeah i mean if you have the l. c. d. display on it that's okay
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0104085_0104232	yeah but i think that yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0143656_0144109	well you know the idea of the product is that we give the customer what he wants
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0160714_0160855	like a triangle
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0087460_0088218	oh
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0052523_0052876	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0068919_0069261	like i said this is only in the high end to make it a little bit expensive
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0068152_0068407	that's exactly what we wanted to do like you said in the email
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0084458_0084804	um yeah the top one is a little bit oh no
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0102253_0102750	well i don't have a lot of money to spend on it but that's not my problem
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0121866_0122045	oh yeah but m well mute
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0217410_0217555	okay we'll see you in a second
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0152281_0152785	we're in the final design phase and i think it's a three or a one
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0061270_0061732	well i think the curve should be a good thing to take out of the shape of the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0016680_0016966	that's a lot on the on the camera
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0218169_0218366	we need to make a decision on that
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0116932_0117417	well let's have the display anyway because that's pretty handy
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0187581_0187863	so it's just like one curve or a double curve
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0105485_0105663	oh
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0082770_0082939	yeah exactly
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0150724_0150827	yeah okay
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0105252_0105882	just take the push buttons for the l. c. d. screen and see what we're pretty much stuck with there
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0075639_0075772	yeah some l. c. d. display
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0121596_0121866	don't sell it
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0107820_0108083	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0144144_0144408	so i don't think that's a problem
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0098758_0098971	they have the top of everything i think
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0154557_0154768	explanation and
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0131772_0132330	like like you know like a lot of nokia phones have it in their remote control
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0069749_0070202	but
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0147696_0147872	yeah but we have to reach the end of the report
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0114442_0114592	does it have a name
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0212781_0213044	it should just look like it's come out of a computer
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0033553_0033856	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0157162_0157354	but it's still important to know
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0136859_0137042	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0090892_0090996	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0078649_0079199	and the l. c. d. on the remote control i'll just take that with me when i open it
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0133153_0133265	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0093450_0094076	you see the menu button it's a little bit small when you want to do some menu stuff
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0113268_0113370	let's see if there's
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0200781_0201493	maybe it's a good idea to do a little more research on the cost of an l. c. d. display
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0073347_0073526	the colour of the l. c. d. doesn't matter too much
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0063316_0063513	yeah i wouldn't no
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0081369_0081562	oh it doesn't matter but does it matter
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0094383_0094598	but but i think it's cool
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0053528_0054020	so which means that you would need a l. c. d. display which is which is much more expensive
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0125696_0125814	exactly
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0151069_0151276	that's the end of it then
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0024562_0025175	yeah let's see if i have the l. c. d. display on it
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0043111_0043280	let's have a yes
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0130898_0131310	everybody is pretty much in agreement on most of the most important things
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0148668_0148771	that's the point
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0023456_0023857	yeah but that's um yeah that's true
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0169143_0169262	yeah no big numbers
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0023273_0023456	yeah i think so that's what you mean
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0084804_0085504	and you get the same message that it's not a lot of buttons on the t. v. but there are enough to use
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0119308_0119597	yeah the the thing is we had the l. c. d. display thing
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0121445_0121759	we have to pay the price
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0011518_0011696	so that's just normal stuff
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0077116_0077494	okay so that's that's also important for the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0139470_0139766	oh yeah it's two is true and one is false
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0155884_0156315	um just to give you an overview of what we need to decide on the final design
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0024302_0024419	it's not a banana
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0050087_0050345	well then we'll deal with it in a minute
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0019590_0019753	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0155026_0155150	so
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0141247_0141500	so i thought i thought i thought it was twenty five
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0183744_0184682	um when you take out the numbers and put them in a list um they come up with an average of like fourteen point one
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0141940_0142114	yeah that's a good idea yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0149558_0149960	oh yeah i mean this is for the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0095446_0096325	we have to make a decision on the remote control that you are going to implement in our product
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0202155_0202278	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0216053_0216169	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0073056_0073347	um i think this is quite a lot of money actually
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0146055_0146174	yeah you might be right
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0126030_0126220	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0160938_0161185	um just make some changes to the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0136076_0136194	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0017326_0017470	oh
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0089258_0089791	just a simple push button that's pretty much the same thing as we just talked about
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0021106_0021208	oh yeah i think
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0172507_0172809	but when you have the buttons and everything
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0172201_0172565	so just like um just a tiny little clip on thing
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0099304_0099420	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0072390_0072533	the curves
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0028508_0028614	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0042437_0042884	if it's on the l. c. d. screen i'm gonna do a little bit of extra work for the design
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0091249_0091487	uh there's a problem with the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0160781_0160938	um there's a little more time
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0018612_0018924	that will get me the money that i need to make it work with the l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0155606_0155728	oh actually it's twenty eight
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0129036_0129224	yeah if they have time
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0194086_0194615	we're selling it at twenty five euros for the l. c. d. display and everything that's left over
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0037073_0037439	well at the moment the top half of the remote has a lot of paint on it
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0141278_0141396	so it's not the
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0028023_0028142	um no
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0178779_0179183	like in the in the way you like for example with the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0201665_0201959	so um we still have the double curve
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0136905_0137789	oh
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0138094_0138215	um
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0149960_0150359	that's that's what everyone expects
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0013593_0013694	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0151225_0151432	is that in the l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0004128_0004707	oh let's see
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0088279_0088765	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0038026_0038251	so i will have to
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0096862_0097042	even if some people can't see it on their screen
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0162869_0163120	yeah i think we should maybe we should write that down
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0075840_0076024	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0164660_0164909	okay i mean it's a little bit too much on the on the design
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0088262_0088398	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0020117_0020297	okay so that's um yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0026983_0027218	that would be the end of the real remote right
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0136275_0136593	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0137042_0137183	yeah they should have done this too
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0146885_0147214	still pretty much up to date in the technology department anyway
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0035394_0035525	but i can do that
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0115163_0115809	okay so i think we should just go with the l. c. d. screen and um you know what this looks like
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0010815_0011006	so you want to buy one
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0169501_0169604	just go to the other page though
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0125543_0125696	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0050314_0050682	and then the buttons are made of some special material anyway
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0092806_0093153	do you have that to do with the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0140610_0140752	so that's down to the twelve and a half
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0137100_0137490	one one minute
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0013694_0013806	yeah of course that's fine
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0069493_0069749	let's take it to the next stage
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0165229_0165633	and i mean the l. c. d. display would be a nice addition right
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0133872_0133975	yeah exactly
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0130210_0130370	yeah that's true
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0057616_0057967	that's that's what i'm looking for anyway
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0018924_0019419	so i don't know if it's like this one or something on the l. c. d. display
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0012024_0012207	but okay
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0062130_0062233	for the speech
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0172809_0173357	is it just is it's just a little bit of design to to improve the look and the feel
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0141075_0141211	yeah i think the other side
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0122354_0122457	yeah i mean we could
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0152773_0153143	let's have that be the menu
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0093222_0093399	oh i'm not sure
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0069233_0069679	oh he's a he's a hippo
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0107377_0107864	yeah that's a problem
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0007677_0008425	oh maybe i missed a part in the in the end but it's fine
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0161997_0162216	example of stupid team work i suppose
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0067354_0067828	you have a lot of this on the front
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0161535_0161657	oh yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0136389_0136592	there's one problem with the menu button
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0139359_0139538	yeah it's two and a half euros actually
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0012309_0012442	oh okay alright
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0141952_0142066	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0096155_0096418	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0175461_0175946	because things like this are pretty expensive and we don't have that much space in the budget for these things
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0123581_0123733	it's just like
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0028614_0028945	um yeah i put a limit to the price
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0086016_0086731	oh
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0199655_0200097	just take out the l. c. d. screen and you still get the yeah that's up to you to decide
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0098317_0098701	yeah but i don't know if you pick it just like a normal push button i guess
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0177347_0177529	yeah and more expensive
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0131849_0132005	yeah maybe
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0140970_0141080	that's what i understood
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0071373_0072234	what's the what's the name of the project that you're working on here which is supposed to be a high end product
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0033280_0033537	yeah i didn't say anything about l. c. d.
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0097105_0097311	oh
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0080941_0081261	well just make it a single curve i guess
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0145149_0145491	yeah we shouldn't have it i think it should be done on the t. v. or something like that
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0181008_0181185	well it's definitely a nice one
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0161185_0161535	just like all black and yellow is kinda hard to distinguish in a dark room
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0206625_0206726	yeah that's the idea
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0109058_0109200	it's like this
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0149560_0149671	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0106821_0106975	oh sorry
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0067735_0067906	oh
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0025175_0025310	it's it's down here
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0090808_0090936	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0051521_0051791	even though it's not very easy to do but that's just what i got
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0051947_0052095	they're not supposed to do that anyway
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0030281_0030441	how are we gonna look at that in the end
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0167052_0167284	so you wanna make it a red one right
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0158247_0158353	and um
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0025880_0026232	oh
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0116104_0116933	so what we did is we took out the l. c. d. screen and instead of a l. c. d. screen do we wanna have a double r. c.
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0203231_0203342	yeah you could make that
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0171289_0171434	at the moment you're still at home
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0147522_0147750	okay we need to replace the l. c. d. display
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0099271_0099427	um
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0003133_0003297	but this is a blank
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0207915_0208053	well you all agree on that
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0204669_0204942	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0037439_0038026	but i mean you could make it a little bit more on the on the top side but not like this
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0093342_0093493	it's okay
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0204584_0204934	banana remote
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0026774_0026982	so we probably won't be able to do that
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0177559_0178451	um yeah you have to look at the menu and um yeah it's a little bit of a problem with the menu on the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0192623_0192899	and then you will lose the l. c. d. menu or something
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0092082_0092228	oh
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0078195_0078339	but i think it's pretty practical
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0127793_0127917	are we looking forward to it
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0106575_0107074	don't make it too small i'll just take a whole remote control
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0203798_0204134	and if you just leave the l. c. d. screen as it is we can make everything
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0123676_0123949	we'll probably just have to make a little prototype presentation
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0087192_0087460	maybe we have a little beep here
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0024032_0024162	oh no
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0068442_0068558	oh
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0168622_0169192	before making a final report i would like to hear back from the boss
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0075772_0076025	so you have to be a little bit more innovative
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0182924_0183290	it feels good in the hand because it's a little bit heavier on the other side
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0023001_0023214	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0161530_0161870	maybe we should do it on the l. c. d. screen anyway
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0180825_0181051	so it's a little bit of the inside of the cover
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0026377_0026667	how do you know exactly what we have to do
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0173517_0173764	and then just put 'em on the l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0094912_0095078	yeah rubber yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0002312_0002562	oh it's not stuck down there
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0085720_0085881	yeah right yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0163174_0163343	well we have to be a little bit different i think
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0216169_0216280	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0209060_0209246	oh no
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0120918_0121032	but
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0064404_0064962	and then the left one is for the mute button and the right one is for the teletext button
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0206901_0207310	so are we talking about solar cells battery
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0040589_0040879	do you guys are you guys looking for a universal remote control
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0128207_0129005	um i think if we decide to go for the l. c. d. screen then we might have some issues
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0100254_0100425	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0019495_0019601	doesn't seem like an issue
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0042884_0043116	it doesn't have to be in the middle of it right now
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0012734_0013051	um do you have the channels um
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0022869_0023008	yeah that's right yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0203342_0203575	that would be a little bad
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0008872_0009062	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0206264_0206444	but i don't think we got that big of a deal
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0076025_0076404	oh that's a good idea
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0035682_0036229	is there any kind of menu or something like that you have on your l. c. d. screen
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0100612_0100744	at the left end of it
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0135493_0135700	maybe if you can grab hold of your remote control
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0133914_0134088	oh no no no that's not okay
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0154289_0154502	oh
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0086228_0086606	let's see what the user wants
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0110161_0110304	yeah okay
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0080690_0080798	yeah that's what we're supposed to do
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0133165_0133775	that that would be a good idea i think
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0131225_0131608	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0202569_0202681	oh
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0199496_0199655	yeah you have to suck on that
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0120594_0120764	okay the l. c. d. is fine
AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0044535_0044929	yeah really a little bit
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0021208_0021506	so i'm just trying to imagine that if we dropped out of that
AMI_EN2002d_H00_FEO070_0033434_0033643	oh it's a good thing
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0018698_0018894	yeah yeah exactly yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0114594_0114697	so it's hard to forget
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0143247_0143567	so that's just to give you a little idea of the two designs
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0112218_0112577	well it's still plastic i guess
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0017326_0017558	yeah
AMI_EN2002d_H03_MEE073_0147902_0148058	it's just for now
AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0013999_0014535	yeah i mean when you take out the l. c. d. screen then you don't need the speech recognition
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0101720_0101945	you mean that we did not use the power button that much
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0080057_0080603	maybe maybe we should have a little less emphasis on the l. c. d. display and a little more emphasis on
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0024789_0025060	okay and i'm just going to talk about that a little bit more if you don't get used to it
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0088518_0089370	oh yeah i don't know if you guys did too much work on the speech recognition uh side of it or not
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0067829_0068347	um we've got we've got a total of twelve and a half
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0104776_0104904	think so yeah
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0072768_0073605	so i don't think it's possible to make something like that because it would be a little bit more expensive than just the l. c. d. screen
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0059098_0059592	so i think it's a good idea to put the l. c. d. on top of it or something like that
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0052492_0052624	are they
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0058638_0058798	okay that's excellent
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0083927_0084464	that's another problem that we have to keep in mind is that the battery power is gonna last a little bit longer
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0095602_0095807	yes that's enough yes
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0077073_0077283	think it's inside like that
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0103865_0104156	okay so let's put that back in
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0031914_0032186	okay so i think it's one of the easiest ways to do it
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0050176_0050322	oh yeah i agree on a curve
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0093518_0094012	just taking out the finishing touches and adding a little more time to the project
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0077978_0078326	actually i think that's pretty much what a user wants in a remote control
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0058512_0058638	seven ten
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0048126_0048468	it doesn't look like anything what we want to do
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0025989_0026225	and important decisions
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0011762_0012154	now we're moving over to your individual work which you have prepared by the way
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0045400_0045694	okay i'll hold it like this on the table
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0060321_0060809	so we have to yeah it's a one
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0081365_0081509	but grey and black winning anyway
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0078326_0078704	and you can make a button on your remote control by filling it in
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0065341_0065540	great big technical
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0057676_0057871	point one and a half or something
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0089871_0090564	for example if you put a little plastic cover on it that's just an extra layer of protection for the device itself not for the l. c. d. display
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0102232_0102399	well probably it would be better
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0082812_0083151	they don't think i think they don't think it's easy to use
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0004975_0005318	let's just have a little fun
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0081235_0081365	what about the overall design
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0061913_0062426	basically having the top selling item on the market
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0027231_0027542	now you would like to go next
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0082379_0082797	can a remote control be placed on a coffee table or something like that
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0058837_0058954	should we make this blue now
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0032413_0032773	it's gonna be your basic design but you can turn it into anything you want
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0061754_0061959	okay pretty much a p. c.
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0066222_0066970	okay um making it just a little bit more trendy than the existing remote controls that are out there in the market
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0101370_0101720	yeah but it doesn't have to be like that
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0054715_0054953	in that product
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0029068_0029332	thank you
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0008048_0008190	okay
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0049778_0049996	that's that's a little bit too much for me
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0045797_0046057	oh wait what does he open here
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0081615_0082363	um maybe i can start with an overview of the current market trends and then discuss our own design
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0057511_0057766	so you m yeah
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0098549_0098880	yeah
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0029332_0029602	okay um maybe you can try to get this information
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0085279_0086194	if you take out the l. c. d. screen then it's not much more expensive to just make a normal one without the l. c. d. screen
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0095091_0095738	maybe it's a little bit more expensive but it's still it's still make it make it a sellable product
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0009196_0009474	um okay this is our agenda
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0086430_0087174	you don't need the l. c. d. screen because i'm not gonna use it like a normal user i think
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0044523_0044668	oh
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0058385_0058512	thirty five
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0080380_0080592	with menus yeah
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0044795_0045085	just put it on the next page 'cause this is a lot of content
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0002515_0002683	so we got close to twelve and a half
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0097068_0097179	yeah i think
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0070861_0071104	okay you want to delete anything in it right now
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0104642_0104829	are we going to do that
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0057871_0058150	point one point two and a half more money than what you can afford
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0035911_0036174	okay alright
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0090564_0091178	let's skip the l. c. d. display because it's a little bit expensive and we don't have the money left in the budget
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0049740_0049998	okay some some black and
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0098880_0099666	just uh just think about what you could do to make the l. c. d. display a little bit better
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0032773_0033136	it doesn't do anything with your basic uh remote control
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0036433_0036784	let's just take a good look at the design
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0104313_0104416	so see you in half an hour
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0094848_0095316	okay i don't think that's something we have to worry about right now
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0102689_0103258	make it a little bit more trendy with the double curved case and the spongy feel on the on the top side
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0031569_0031739	let's see the numbers
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0028757_0028966	the pen will tell you
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0018883_0019207	okay anyway let's see what price we have left
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0036174_0036765	okay just have to see what what's on the l. c. d. screen when you want to go to a different channel
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0071292_0071717	everybody's agreed on the basic design of the remote control i suppose
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0028908_0029068	oh yeah
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0002237_0002381	and i'm supposed to make this up
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0010193_0010814	um then we'll take a look at the project budget and close down
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0090577_0090750	that's up to the quality of the l. c. d. screen
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0102210_0102441	yeah yeah
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0046109_0046216	technical hell
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0079446_0080057	so i think you made it more interesting by changing the way we were doing the drawing in the last meeting
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0054142_0054715	oh an advanced chip and a battery that's pretty good
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0048877_0049141	it's not a part of our logo anyway
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0075081_0075529	and you still don't have some more information on the l. c. d. display and stuff
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0085098_0085279	what i mean does everyone see it
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0094353_0094756	you can give the feel of a sponge ball in your remote control
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0102504_0102689	and make sure the screen is not really on top
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0072244_0072768	but basic channel and teletext button for all the normal channels one to nine
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0068347_0069167	so we take out the l. c. d. screen and add an optional one which is a little bit more expensive
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0073498_0073730	yeah the menu button that's the same thing
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0014958_0015940	um what needs to be fulfilled here is that the product has to look fancy and have to have the latest technology in it
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0084373_0084958	yes and it's just like you can have a l. c. d. screen on it which shows what's going on
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0009568_0010193	we still have to get back to our own project but maybe we'll talk a little bit more about that
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0060809_0061392	so if we take out the l. c. d. display it's possible to put more money into the l. c. d. display or something like that
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0037384_0037686	well as you can see the cost is a little bit higher
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0070270_0070483	but that's that could be good for the curve i think
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0075486_0075592	um
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0028514_0028661	let's come on with this
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0095678_0095860	yeah small yeah
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0052028_0052492	did you get an email about the project deadline or something
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0033136_0034096	and it's a little bit more expensive than the ten and a half cents
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0065357_0066222	yeah i think so because we don't have a lot of things like l. c. d. display and speech recognition on it anyway
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0082252_0082379	oh
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0002986_0003229	yeah that's good
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0006420_0006633	oh no
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0014283_0014958	okay um is this the final design or are we going for a more elaborate design first
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0082937_0083405	yeah that's basically my idea you take out the l. c. d. screen
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0036460_0036601	okay
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0046538_0046851	so hard to lose that in a drawer for instance
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0046851_0047088	okay
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0089370_0089931	you have to take out the l. c. d. screen and i think it's a little bit of a big deal
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0037143_0037529	and my drawing skills are so bad that i'm losing all the time
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0001887_0002029	okay that's fine
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0058488_0058597	seven and a half
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0043874_0044199	yeah that's a bit of a problem
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0060813_0060929	think i
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0056546_0057464	um what i found out is that we sell our product for twenty five euros which is a standard price on the market right now
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0001099_0001453	but we're not really looking at the l. c. d. display anyway
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0078704_0079448	make it a little bit easier to design a remote control if you want to use the l. c. d. display or speech recognition on it
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0043248_0043437	uh a strong
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0018410_0018612	so
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0071188_0071292	yeah
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0048966_0049134	okay
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0056312_0056546	that was fine
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0047441_0047935	okay i'm gonna have a look at the budget and see if there's enough money to do this
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0010814_0011589	and i'm going to tell us a little bit more about what we discussed during our last discussion session
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0062426_0062944	um which is pretty much the same as um a normal pen
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0012154_0012699	um we want it to be something special that people are willing to pay for
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0003130_0003339	okay by the way
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0035348_0035555	yeah okay
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0035651_0036214	we take up a little bit of space on the l. c. d. display i guess to give my presentation
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0061351_0061782	um yeah so total production cost is twelve and a half
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0069167_0069939	and you get the same information that we got from the last meeting about the project budget and the new project requirements
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0052413_0052596	you go
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0064823_0065111	every piece of information is used one and a half euro
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0008382_0009196	um my personal preferences are that the l. c. d. screen is amazing
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0024322_0024433	we're running out of time
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0050119_0050466	okay a nice slide show
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0015940_0016094	um changeable covers
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0070596_0070891	you still don't have a finished remote control do you
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0017038_0017203	okay right
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0084120_0084324	yeah the l. c. d. yeah
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0042812_0043022	uh square
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0069939_0070270	so i think that's maybe it should have been a little bit more creative with the title
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0051987_0052095	let's go with the
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0071124_0071332	yeah can you see
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0100524_0101484	well i think you could make it a little bit thicker 'cause i don't think the l. c. d. screen is something that you can hold in your hand
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0098120_0098951	okay and i think that's pretty much up to date at this point in time before we get back to the final design plan
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0052430_0052863	you have a name yeah
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0081521_0081896	let's see you in a minute
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0052691_0052920	okay okay alright i'm not good at drawing
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0071717_0072244	doing it in a trendy way which is pretty much the same as doing it in a boring traditional way
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0043985_0044177	okay let's see
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0044014_0044212	okay
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0037680_0037894	let's start it off again i think
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0063129_0063642	yes um yeah i suppose you m yeah
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0059419_0060321	the one that you have on the left has a little more money than the one on the right because they don't want to lose their money at the end of the day
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0002912_0003048	can i not show it on my own
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0045045_0045174	well
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0035001_0035109	okay thank you
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0095969_0096635	and maybe we should lose the l. c. d. screen and just make it a normal push button remote control that's lost in your living room
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0064913_0065029	yeah no
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0044316_0044795	um i'm pretty much satisfied with your leadership throughout the entire day
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0101945_0102210	if i don't have to make a list of possible things we could lose the speech recognition
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0049290_0049778	and uh some buttons are hidden behind this
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0077283_0077979	it makes it a little bit more complicated because you don't have to make it exactly the same as what we came up with
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0047671_0047779	oh
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0008050_0008166	to make it a two
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0092964_0093488	and that's what you expect out of a remote control according to our slogan
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0099666_0100524	so we took the the look and feel of the apple and put it into the in the product because it's a cool idea
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0055366_0055677	okay there we go that's a pretty new idea by the way
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0051612_0051866	um don't
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0095738_0095924	but it has to make it complex somehow
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0087683_0088287	and i just got a new email and i'm not sure if you guys got the same thing because i didn't get it through my own mail
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0067520_0067829	what are your experiences with remote controls
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0103258_0103865	yeah i think that's a good idea but let's see what the costs look like
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0083464_0083927	so that's a problem if you make a universal remote control with the l. c. d. display
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0012699_0013201	it's it's not a triple r. c. m. on the remote control anyway
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0031347_0031914	it's it's not exactly the same thing it says so
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0058085_0058757	yeah that's the same thing you said last time yeah a lot of buttons on there
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0080603_0081203	and maybe it's even more important if you sell it to a lot of people and have some sales information on it
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0086443_0086588	but i don't have any
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0058954_0059174	we can drop the l. c. d. screen for example
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0082135_0082252	yeah
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0025453_0025724	and i'd say manage as much as possible
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0039041_0039795	yeah yeah it can be a curve or a double curve
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0070518_0070672	you saw the ones on the top
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0051149_0051612	after that i'll put all the documents in a shared folder
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0039631_0039980	maybe it's a good idea to pick up the pen
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0008190_0008382	hello everybody
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0049996_0050809	let's see if you can make it a little bit thicker on the top and a little bit thinner on the bottom
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0096635_0096916	doesn't seem to be implemented at all
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0087295_0087683	keep in mind i'm just looking for the final report right
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0100916_0101130	so yeah
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0042120_0042597	yeah and uh i think that's the only thing to add on top of it
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0052920_0053660	so i think they really like fruit and vegetables on top of their remote control
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0016231_0016780	how are we gonna take out the l. c. d. display and what's going to happen with the speech recognition anyway
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0094012_0094353	so you have to fill in a little bit of colour for the top remote control
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0050809_0051149	okay um i'm gonna give an update on everything
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0096916_0097245	so you're totally out of your design time
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0097097_0097935	okay um we're going to have a little extra time after the meeting because we're actually running out of time anyway
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0000037_0000176	uh-huh
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0039795_0040627	yeah but it was just an example and it took a lot of time to work out the final product because there was a problem with the l. c. d. screen
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0027731_0027975	yeah that's true
AMI_ES2004a_H02_MEE014_0037960_0038448	because it's gonna be a little bit longer now because we have to look into the costs and all that kind of thing
AMI_ES2004a_H00_MEO015_0075518_0075806	so you could implement a special colour
AMI_ES2004a_H01_FEE013_0091369_0091737	well a kind of orange but not too bright
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0217196_0218132	so it's kind of a compromise between the l. c. d. display and the speech recognition technology to make an affordable remote control for people under twenty five
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0123492_0123679	yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0193952_0194291	yes which is one less than twelve and a half
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0065404_0066192	because you have more money than than a normal remote control which has to be made out of rubber or something like that and having a higher brand recognition in the market
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0182540_0182649	product name yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0061620_0062515	but basically what i did was we made a list of the most important buttons like volume and teletext and how much time you spend on it every day
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0083436_0083550	yeah i think you can put it in there
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0086670_0087219	all the information we get from um latest market trends and fashion updates
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0012023_0012947	um we had to make it a little bit more attractive for the young target group
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0088814_0089076	so these are all important aspects of the design
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0148224_0148581	just make sure you don't lose your thing in the couch or something and not find it sitting on the armchair
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0124766_0125253	um we wanna lose the l. c. d. screen
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0129154_0129967	it's the most expensive part of the remote control is the l. c. d. display so you have to make sure that it's not lost in your house
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0143060_0143427	maybe the l. c. d. display can be integrated for a better score
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0008127_0008353	okay um
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0216498_0216776	um i think we have to run out of time
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0221657_0222602	yeah and you could add an extra feature to it that it's a little bit more trendy than just a regular remote control
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0053624_0053899	that can't be okay that's the question
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0066741_0067462	but we want to make it a little bit more trendy so that people buy this one and uh take it with them to the party
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0060255_0060416	it's not
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0215628_0216163	so which means that the l. c. d. display could be either one curve or two curves depending on the design
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0206780_0206923	oh make me the logo
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0051225_0051707	so that was just uh a little unclear on that point
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0146158_0146540	or maybe you can make a special colour for the l. c. d. display
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0045351_0045881	what we have to keep in mind is that there's a lot of new information
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0232530_0232698	think we're lost again i guess
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0153020_0153426	yellow and black or green and yellow or any other combination you like
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0147756_0148224	are you gonna implement the speech recognition or the l. c. d. screen
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0123366_0123469	is it a special colour
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0191820_0192107	yeah yeah it could be on the back then
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0184190_0184550	because we're focusing on the younger segment but not so much on the finance
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0154040_0154364	if people buy a t. v. in twenty five euros they buy a remote control for twenty five
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0137001_0137251	yeah it's possible to make the l. c. d. display
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0103167_0103614	is there any more information that you can give us on the l. c. d. display
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0206728_0206856	we could look into that but
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0078855_0079091	it's it's pretty straight forward
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0097607_0098356	um it's a little bit more expensive than the simple remote control but still pretty cheap
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0017791_0017931	can i get the camera
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0114818_0115453	so i think it's pretty much in line with our goal of doing a universal remote control
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0200218_0200588	so it's kind of like a black and white or something like that you can see on a banana
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0019400_0019512	um end
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0230012_0230375	um i think you get my point made clear
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0044440_0045351	would you give it a one because you would change the shape of the remote control with the with the with the with the channel and the volume and everything
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0158124_0158361	plastic is kind of cheap but
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0143394_0143531	yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0207989_0208367	so you don't really take it like a normal remote control or something like that
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0024903_0025738	um i had a look at some trends from the latest fashion updates on what's supposed to happen in the future
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0186123_0186346	um what else for example
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0090332_0091220	but i think it's more important to have a nice looking remote control because our brand name is already pretty strong in the market
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0192773_0192946	ready to discuss the working design
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0142436_0143060	but maybe it's uh yeah if you have the l. c. d. uh remote control as a option
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0123800_0124766	um the third most important thing is that we have to make sure that the remote control is very stylish
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0189772_0190169	you're not using it in such a way that it sends out infrared light
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0220670_0221444	just take a look at the price of the buttons and what kind of things that have to be printed on the on the back side of the thing
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0226198_0226844	and um we took a look at some trends from the b internet about what people want
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0013633_0014340	um what we decided on was to limit it to a basic design
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0008031_0008152	okay so that's not uh
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0207410_0207989	you could also make a little logo on the back of the remote control 'cause it looks like a spongy thing
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0080544_0080661	you don't
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0059104_0059321	it's a one
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0112627_0113386	okay something like that which are more important than the l. c. d. display and the speech recognition anyway
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0077302_0077469	uh anything else you can come up with
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0128591_0128772	it's a good way to lose your remote control
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0060673_0060814	it's changing the colour
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0191928_0192056	yeah that's on your side
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0018212_0018341	thanks
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0106034_0106148	um
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0206040_0206644	um everything is actually made out of plastic except for the l. c. d. display
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0121865_0122367	you need to see it first before you decide on what buttons to use
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0219067_0219618	if you make it a little bit spongy in the middle instead of soft on the outside
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0229731_0230004	or just an l. c. d. screen could also be a good idea
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0101820_0102050	so those two things are like twelve and a half euros each
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0172808_0173473	but we're just talking about the basic design of the remote control which is going to be implemented in the l. c. d. display
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0036880_0037334	but i was asked to take out the l. c. d. screen by the way
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0127142_0127782	it's going to be a little bit more expensive on the advanced options because we're just adding some extra functions into the design
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0184469_0185430	but as you can see we lost a little bit of the flexibility by making the remote control just a flat piece of plastic and not having the l. c. d. display
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0116582_0117240	we took out the l. c. d. display because it's too expensive and i also took out the speech recognition feature because it's not very useful
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0188854_0189772	well then you have the the look and feel of a remote control which is like what they had in the in the last meeting
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0148581_0148982	so that's kind of like what we had in the initial sketch that we talked about
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0019224_0019332	oh eight
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0232414_0232555	yes right
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0047240_0047388	and then finally
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0176511_0176914	that's more of a feature than that's a lot of extra stuff to add to the to the remote control
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0180251_0180354	oh yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0113429_0114281	um we didn't make a lot of progress in the last thirty minutes because we only have ten minutes left before the meeting ends
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0077551_0077886	um the task i will give it to you
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0019684_0019789	alright
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0180470_0180828	yeah but if you have something in the middle it's still a compromise
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0173473_0174307	like we talked about in the last meeting changing covers is kind of a trend that people are willing to change their covers for fashion updates
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0091790_0092588	so you press a button on your l. c. d. screen and the l. c. d. screen flashes up with your favourite channel or programme name
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0208703_0209017	that's a really simple thing that i didn't think about
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0151286_0151974	but i think that's actually quite a nice option if you want to expand your l. c. d. screen with speech recognition
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0166423_0166641	you're working on the design part of it anyway
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0111510_0112232	or you could take out the l. c. d. screen and say hey i wanna see the real remote control now
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0174307_0174740	if you put them in a folder and then you can put all the files into one big file which you can send with your presentation
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0023844_0024692	the l. c. d. screen is something new but it's also something that has to be implemented in the same price range
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0190169_0190674	but it doesn't really make any sense because we lost all the buttons and it's just not as easy to learn
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0203150_0204079	um taking that into consideration the design of the remote control which is supposed to appeal to young people
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0051594_0051715	yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0132750_0133469	but i mean it's not gonna take up a lot of battery power to make a basic remote control right
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0107683_0108058	so we can make a profit of twelve and a half on this product
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0130021_0130539	so we're a little bit short on the l. c. d. display or something like that
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0106856_0107844	if it's if it's more expensive to make the l. c. d. display and all those little things which you can't see on the on the outside
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0134432_0135394	um let's say that it's a little bit more expensive but you don't have to lose the shape of the whole remote control
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0085725_0086149	um so we used that a lot during the last meeting as well
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0233342_0233739	maybe you can ask me if there's any more information
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0095591_0096272	it's pretty much the same thing as we talked about in the previous step uh selling price of twelve and a half euros
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0199279_0199946	so that's pretty much the same thing as what you came up with here except that they lose some of their curves
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0165894_0166237	and you wouldn't have that in a normal uh remote control you would see
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0125931_0126371	um people are looking for a good remote control
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0036119_0036880	because the numbers on the top of the remote control i mean that's the most important part where people will see it
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0169347_0169912	it's just a little bit more expensive but it's not too bad if you want to buy a normal rubber remote control
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0221444_0221589	um it could be a
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0112245_0112700	we're sticking to plastic and i think it's pretty straight forward on the l. c. d. screen
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0003704_0003883	okay alright
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0190909_0191734	yeah but if you put the l. c. d. screen in there then you have to get a lot of more money because that's just an extra thing on the on the yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0225709_0225935	that's not something we're looking at in the marketing report
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0061180_0061367	it's okay it's okay
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0010062_0010181	appreciate
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0051707_0051903	and that's uh
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0219960_0220091	but they will look at the curve
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0126492_0126781	um we need to focus on that at least
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0089695_0090332	we made a prototype which was supposed to be sold for twenty five euros but we didn't sell any of them
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0027266_0027489	the end result is still in my document
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0222671_0223557	and it's supposed to be a little bit spongy in some way because people are willing to spend more money on spongy stuff
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0197718_0197875	okay we've got a special colour
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0196261_0196662	and we still don't make a lot of money on the l. c. d. display anyway
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0213830_0213973	just have it lost a little bit
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0209017_0209569	even if it's not okay for you to look into that because of time constraints or something like that
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0193074_0193261	so why would you use the rechargeable
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0169104_0169455	um and it has to be long enough for a remote control
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0175078_0175985	which is a little bit of a problem when we are aiming for the younger audience because it's very hard to sell our l. c. d. remote to them
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0154752_0155002	um we are taking out buttons
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0097238_0097521	the buttons don't have to be completely lost all the time
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0087219_0087626	do you just have a single remote control or a set of remotes with different covers
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0081185_0081594	uh oh
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0081740_0082067	but it doesn't matter
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0043307_0044180	the the goal of the project is to uh come up with a new remote control for the t. v.
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0209833_0210338	just to keep in mind the whole idea of having a nice looking remote control and not hurting your t. v.
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0052766_0053017	okay thank you very much
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0205260_0205875	to some extent um something like this is already being implemented
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0216283_0216461	but we can take like this for example
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0146528_0146951	the l. c. d. is just an additional menu to the speech recognition i guess
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0232273_0232423	for example channel
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0174740_0175078	you can control the television from the l. c. d. screen
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0083679_0083990	let's keep it a little bit plastic too
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0080959_0081103	we'll just do the best we can
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0004768_0004918	okay
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0134069_0134462	yeah that's yeah that's what you said
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0009263_0009912	we decided on a twelve and a half euro for the selling price of our product
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0101496_0101820	um that the remote control is trendy and easy to use
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0076762_0076903	so it's in a little on off menu
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0022885_0023358	well basically the l. c. d. display just takes a little bit of extra space
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0175985_0176511	if you push a button on this one they don't know which colour it is if you push a button on this one they don't know which colour it is
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0117928_0118404	so you have the l. c. d. screen which is yeah can be yellow or whatever
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0180125_0180592	what are you taking this into consideration when you're designing a remote control or something like that
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0080309_0080569	okay let's go through this
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0220232_0220665	is this just another product or is it a part of the design that we're looking for
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0008593_0008870	welcome again to our last meeting i guess
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0233929_0234196	um i'm not allowed to talk anymore
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0153426_0153757	do we really have to go for one of those anyway
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0159538_0159772	now if you take out the voice recognition feature
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0195498_0196249	but maybe you have to keep in mind that the remote control has got some kind of hidden menu or something
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0110866_0111006	yes
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0199151_0199252	yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0199946_0200218	and you don't have to buy a new remote control now
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0172320_0172808	can i just make a quick summary of what we can do on this one before i lose my remote control
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0033769_0034754	yeah you can just take out one of the scroll wheels and replace it with another one so that you don't get lost when you're uh scrolling through the menu
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0080345_0080468	oh i think you take that
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0123385_0123711	so that's something like that to make it a little bit different
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0110905_0111510	if you if you get a yeah if you get one scroll wheel push button on the back then that's fine
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0084009_0084398	maybe you should take out the l. c. d. thing then yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0163884_0164486	because you're gonna put your remote control on a piece of rubber anyway if you wanna get rid of the l. c. d. screen
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0029482_0029852	you don't want very small l. c. d. display in a remote control
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0048772_0049534	um it could be a good idea to just to sum up the information from the financial part
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0196662_0197058	the scroll button on the side and the black buttons on the remote control itself
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0059548_0059679	finance and yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0109550_0109781	just only for t. v. s
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0183125_0183634	just the top of the remote control has to be nice and sharp no
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0073649_0074378	yeah and we could also make an extra version of the l. c. d. screen which is a little bit more expensive but that will be fine
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0128772_0129154	the end of the day is the end of the day is the end of the working design
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0207096_0207273	but it's what we're making to talk about
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0042276_0042828	it's not not a problem if you want to sell it i don't know
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0064255_0064919	so it's possible to make a remote control with l. c. d. display and speech recognition as long as we pay extra for the l. c. d.
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0103869_0104058	um right
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0166237_0166555	you just you don't know where the l. c. d. display goes actually
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0080875_0081185	oh i have to make it all up
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0118404_0118899	just an extra option to select a different channel or something like that i'm not sure that's feasible in the budget
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0223519_0223739	and the real reaction triple r. c.
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0143672_0144196	so you're basically designing a black and yellow design on the on the outside
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0081594_0081740	and make it
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0016119_0016324	okay
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0063691_0064255	um i have my basic information on how the market will respond to such a product
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0135290_0135625	well you don't know how much you'd have to just say no no no problem
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0077886_0078435	okay anyway if someone wants to add something on the remote control let's see what they want
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0074762_0075212	so as you may have noticed this is a little bit more expensive
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0072814_0073649	okay so maybe we have a little more money in our budget and we can make a special edition of the remote control for people who have t. v. s
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0212165_0212769	maybe you could do a little design for us um what you'd like to focus on
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0051715_0052358	my personal preferences are that we take out the l. c. d. screen and make it a little bit more trendy than what is already on the market
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0230717_0230976	to change the l. c. d. settings is important
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0159772_0160276	it's pretty much the same thing as last time where people are willing to pay more for a fancy look and feel
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0229266_0229414	yeah i think that's
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0164486_0164979	but if you're doing something like that it's not too much to try to find out if you want to save it
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0192253_0192616	so are we taking out the speech recognition or something like that
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0096272_0097238	uh twenty five percent of the people think that they spend a lot of time learning to use a new remote control and thirty one percent think that they spend a lot of time learning to use a new t. v.
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0136652_0136766	yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0201381_0201563	how much time do you have left in the project anyway
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0166569_0167039	um i'm not sure because it's fallen on the couch for a second
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0115453_0115669	so i don't know if we have to take that out or not
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0171461_0171636	excellent
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0127782_0128591	what are you taking out of the design to make it more trendy and what are you adding to the design to make it a universal remote control
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0153750_0153940	we could go for the basic colour of course
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0182307_0183125	and that you can still work with a normal chip because there's a little bit of extra information that they want to pack in
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0146796_0147715	okay it's just a little bit of fun to see the numbers and then um we need to come up with something for the next phase
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0181366_0181542	so i think
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0202482_0202746	yeah but l. c. d. screen should be on top actually
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0223912_0224048	um
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0030249_0030387	oh no one
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0022501_0022885	well what i found was that the trends are quite interesting
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0132038_0132750	okay but you came up with the name of the product which is not what we talked about earlier
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0198846_0199279	it looks like a black one but it has a little bit of bright colours on it
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0169712_0170288	okay but i think if it's not for the number of buttons it's fine with me
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0215162_0215553	it's a little bit easy to pick up anyway
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0007420_0007886	um are you ready to get started on the design phase
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0109419_0109550	you don't know what i think
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0229455_0229731	would you like to make a presentation about what was discussed last time
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0157418_0157983	but i think we're missing out on a lot from the fact that we don't talk about finance
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0198282_0198846	what kind of design uh what's a nice way to say hello with your remote control
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0194291_0194770	um the shape you get from a triple r. c.
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0179443_0180041	it's the same thing if you're pressing the button for ten seconds in the next iteration of your design
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0210880_0211441	yeah i think it's a nice idea but we really need to lose the l. c. d. screen and the voice recognition
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0197058_0197764	we're a little bit out of time and we don't have any more information about the advanced chip or something like that
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0011216_0012023	we took into consideration the fact that we wanted to implement speech recognition in our product which is a little bit of a problem
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0014485_0014869	looking into the trends on what to want in a remote control
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0114281_0114818	the third thing that i found out is that the buttons have to be of a different colour than the rest of the l. c. d. screen
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0208341_0208598	well we need to think about how big it's going to look like
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0158340_0158878	just talking about the speech recognition and maybe give it a two or something because of the advanced chip
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0193338_0193963	yeah that would yeah that would be nice to have a menu button down here and then you could go back up there
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0091220_0091790	um the remote control has got a lot of new features which are not available on our current model
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0176922_0177063	yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0165402_0165877	it's not just one thing it's like an entire new feature that's not in our package
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0200744_0201169	so um you don't have to tell us how long it's supposed to last
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0148982_0149485	um my personal coach is to stay at home and watch t. v.
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0186957_0187714	but i think that's a good thing because you got the l. c. d. display but we took out the back light
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0185430_0185816	and you just stick it on top of it so it doesn't get lost in your room or something
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0120074_0120646	we don't have a lot of buttons we can display on the l. c. d. screen
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0224964_0225675	well we got the budget of twelve and a half euros but that's the limit i think
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0102724_0103167	and i think you should just make it a little smaller because i had too much text on my screen
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0092588_0092783	so again there's a problem with the l. c. d.
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0187956_0188561	um the the m the most expensive part of the remote has to be yellow
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0181827_0181972	inspiration and material
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0218236_0219067	that was the name of the company that came up with um a new remote control that's lost in the living room
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0031970_0032302	can i ask a question do i have to include that in the report
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0180828_0181323	but anyway if we're making a universal remote control for everybody then it's probably better
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0061477_0061620	yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0151052_0151322	yeah but now it's impossible to make it
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0094690_0095591	the remote control is pretty much the same as you would find in most telephones but with uh some extra buttons for example on the menu selection or something
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0219412_0219960	so when you pick up the remote control people are willing to pay extra for speech recognition
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0082660_0082831	okay i'm gonna get out of here
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0100548_0101364	because if we're going for the l. c. d. screen then it's a little bit more expensive than if we're not including the l. c. d. screen
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0029852_0030249	um most people want a spongy material
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0209569_0209833	it's not like you can make it black and yellow in one
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0225935_0226310	maybe we should put some more emphasis on the look and style of our remote control
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0035461_0036032	um i'm not sure if the last one was lost somewhere in the house but we should just make one more point
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0211441_0212121	you can still see the l. c. d. screen on your remote control even if we take out the speech recognition
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0042828_0043307	well the remote control is not that bad in the end but you know what i'm talking about
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0227308_0228085	but the fact that it should be in a in a dark room or in some kind of environment that's not familiar to the human being
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0228085_0228384	um i don't know if we did that yet
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0098896_0099689	um the final design should be a classic look and feel with a little bit of spongy material on top
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0200379_0200552	clearly double curved
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0122886_0123385	okay but you put it in the l. c. d. screen and it's always on top of your t. v. right
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0109768_0109931	would that improve the look and feel
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0032617_0033253	if you look at the if you look at the shape of the remote control you can see that it looks more like a fruit because we dropped the curves
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0053017_0053235	did you come up with anything like that
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0100431_0100548	we don't put a smile on it
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0093454_0094252	um we can also come up with some more ideas for the design if it's possible and not too expensive of course
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0164979_0165402	you don't need it's not a part of the standard design but it's a nice touch
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0185840_0186028	okay so
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0044335_0044440	which would be difficult
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0183396_0183560	oh
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0081300_0081424	it might be a little bit of a problem
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0144633_0145286	maybe you can make a menu button in your l. c. d. screen and just navigate through all the all the different sub menus
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0064919_0065298	and it was easy to use so i would say be able to use it in my own household too
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0163198_0163315	yeah yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0122367_0122886	maybe you can take a look at the email and see if there's something on the p. d. c. that you missed
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0049534_0049953	and i think we also took something out of the budget by doing that so
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0151424_0151723	yeah speech recognition but
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0098356_0098896	you still have more money than the cost of a normal remote control so you can lose the l. c. d. screen
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0109929_0110099	yeah two yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0106240_0106856	or is it going to be our company name or corporate colour and slogan
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0017650_0017791	okay yeah let's go ahead
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0171608_0171863	so that's yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0000818_0000982	that's up there
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0231160_0231851	there's a little bit of money left in the budget anyway which they need for some new designs i guess
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0185816_0186123	so that's something we could be thinking about
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0201249_0201901	so it's like you have to hold it in your left hand or something because it's not a normal remote control
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0117240_0117928	would you pay more for an l. c. d. screen or a speech recognition feature in a remote control
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0041918_0042276	and this is what i had to say about the buttons as well
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0201997_0202359	so you kinda hold it in your hand like this with the volume button somewhere
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0154022_0154151	yeah i can
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0125490_0125856	what you were talking about making the titanium a little different from the rest
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0138337_0138495	uh-huh
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0228984_0229266	yeah and what's different from there
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0225575_0225709	um
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0215455_0215628	yeah maybe we could come up with some sort of
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0166940_0167575	if you take away the l. c. d. menu it's a bit of a loss for the user i guess
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0023358_0023844	well the the problem with that is um the colour of the end
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0102050_0102645	even though the cover is black and yellow it's not that fancy in a in a sense that they go out and buy a new cover for their t. v.
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0221346_0221738	so getting rid of the white board is kind of a pretty big deal
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0017503_0017732	that's fine that's no problem
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0206981_0207096	oh
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0138496_0138917	but anyway the l. c. d. display is uh something we discussed earlier
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0025738_0026006	uh but we all want to be able to like
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0118844_0119020	yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0040149_0040724	maybe that's what we should focus on which is the most important part of the l. c. d. display
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0226542_0226773	directory for example
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0019596_0019726	advanced chip
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0092792_0093454	just a few buttons to select menu and then the l. c. d. screen appears on top of your t. v.
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0178286_0178408	um
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0033253_0033769	there has to be space for the l. c. d. display that they speak about
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0117659_0117763	okay alright
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0087633_0088097	um we have sixty minutes of time left for our last stage i suppose
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0205116_0205242	yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0170208_0170330	yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0053591_0053854	oh maybe a little bit more to the top
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0212769_0213100	you could have done a fancy cover design
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0232559_0232680	uh i think it's too expensive
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0109781_0110213	but do we need a multi channel digital t. v. guide
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0160471_0160942	okay the remote control is soft to the touch
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0229030_0229156	yeah i think
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0185334_0185586	just put the l. c. d. display somewhere else of course
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0213100_0213867	and you could lose one single curve for example like we have here a double curve
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0104172_0104485	um we have new product requirements
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0165687_0165894	and you would yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0130630_0131204	yeah i mean you could just have an l. c. d. display instead of the speech recognition maybe that would be nice
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0066315_0066622	like channel changing or volume changing or like the l. c. d. display
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0162240_0162351	rubber is a
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0158878_0159335	you want to make a new product but not people will buy it
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0210338_0210880	take out the speech recognition and take out the l. c. d. screen or something like that
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0069035_0069351	the flip can be flipped open to make a part of it
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0060486_0060728	come on put the l. c. d. in it
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0133869_0134201	um you take a number which is sent to the
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0016324_0016680	um sorry i take over from here pretty much
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0211055_0211171	yeah we could lose the curve then
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0086149_0086670	the l. c. d. display gave us a lot of new information which we could use for the conceptual design
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0149607_0150179	maybe i'm just talking about something that we don't have to implement in our remote control first before we can sell it
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0188561_0188987	but you could change the colour and then you'd lose the mute button i guess
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0194770_0195498	you don't want a little bit of black on one side and a little bit of white on the other side
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0160942_0161612	um we've got the the numbers um let's call it the easy to use
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0227005_0227308	to have a little less space is supposed to be an issue
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0080727_0080950	you can talk to it
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0156520_0157418	well the basic idea is that there are two types of remotes a normal one and a regular one with the black cover
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0089076_0089559	um we focus on young people from sixteen to twenty five and a half million
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0103476_0103651	let's
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0184229_0184510	and th yeah they should be there
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0171863_0172203	but that would just be for a little bit of extra cash
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0216798_0217196	can i just make a quick conclusion on the whole project or do you have more questions
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0131349_0131665	the basic colour should be yellow and black should be the primary colours
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0133620_0133736	what about
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0144196_0144633	you are doing the marketing uh analysis because it's the end of the day
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0183560_0184036	maybe it's a good thing to find out more about the market if you want to try to make a different remote control
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0021250_0021849	okay this is the agenda for today's meeting uh the user interface designer
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0059477_0059630	finance
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0181972_0182307	but i mean there's there's a cost issue
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0137206_0137531	um but um yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0039212_0040149	after this meeting we have about twelve and a half euros left which is not enough to build a nice new remote control for twenty five euros or so
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0105110_0106034	we're not using the l. c. d. display anymore because it's too expensive and taking up too much of our budget
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0204322_0205260	if you have an l. c. d. screen it's a little bit more expensive than if you have a simple push button or something like that
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0186346_0186957	maybe we need an l. c. d. display on it or something
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0164781_0164911	just one curve in the middle
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0154265_0154787	and we're targeting people between twenty five and thirty five years old which is pretty much the younger part of our market
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0181639_0182014	uh i'm not sure if we can implement speech recognition in it
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0184036_0184327	but the remote control will have to be more than just for the l. c. d.
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0131327_0131716	yeah just yeah
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0187714_0187922	what kind of battery power we're gonna need
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0052171_0052865	okay yeah that's what i mean if you see that on the on the l. c. d. screen
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0223739_0224192	was there any new project requirements that we didn't expect
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0126734_0127142	yeah first of all make sure that the remote control is not bad looking
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0103460_0103591	okay
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0135518_0135840	you just don't have to put it up yourself or something
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0190674_0191003	um let's see something that is a little different
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0101364_0101496	probably
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0033595_0033876	yeah the scroll wheel you can make it a little different right
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0006681_0007420	okay um maybe this is a little bit out of our price range on the l. c. d. screen
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0027489_0028055	so i don't wanna lose the l. c. d. screen anyway because it's on top
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0013141_0013633	oh okay but you have to have a base
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0088097_0088814	the other thing i found out is that if you take a look at the current remote controls on the market they are all very ugly
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0181323_0181622	okay now we're just gonna talk a little bit
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0110444_0110888	well you c you can make a design and then we'll come back and see if it's okay
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0084171_0084387	okay write it down right here
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0110365_0110586	well i d i don't know if you've got the l. c. d.
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0192552_0192970	yeah some stuff on the l. c. d. display
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0067462_0067737	so what's the total cost of a complete product
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0202640_0203026	you can look into the menu design
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0155203_0155496	the way we took the corporate colour and the three r. c.
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0021996_0022501	okay well this is what i had in my presentation by the way
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0060745_0061098	oh no it's just a name okay
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0152211_0152875	do you have any new findings on the look and feel of our remote control
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0017101_0017584	okay i'm just a little bit confused if it's possible to make an l. c. d. display on top of that or not
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0000020_0000483	let's have a party
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0145256_0146158	and we can take out the l. c. d. display if we don't want to make it more expensive then we have to stick with the traditional one
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0032302_0032675	so you take out the square buttons and replace it with a circle or something
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0034754_0035461	which is a little bit of a problem on the on the speech recognition um side to get sound out
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0016866_0017062	how should we finish our meeting
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0161750_0162392	well can't make the l. c. d. display on top of the remote control anyway
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0099689_0100431	if we take out the speech recognition and the l. c. d. screen then that's gonna save us a lot of money
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0082370_0082509	where am i
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0127940_0128210	but you have the l. c. d. display on the top of the product
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0208230_0208684	okay i'm just thinking if you take out the speech recognition part it might be a little bit more expensive
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0179203_0179843	um let's not get too much lost in the details but we have a nice idea
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0141328_0141902	yeah i think it's pretty hard to lose a remote control 'cause you have to shake it every now and then to recharge it or something like that
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0080189_0080629	okay and can we implement a l. c. d. display on it
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0154292_0154798	but there are other designs which are also in the market and they're not very expensive or something like that
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0220136_0220425	the volume yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0065014_0065289	if you if you make the l. c. d. screen then you lose the menu button
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0213084_0213742	and maybe the basic colour should be changed to a more fancy colour and the l. c. d. display should be changeable
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0149237_0149677	just thinking about the basic design of the remote control which is pretty much the same thing
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0165863_0166384	the production cost of twelve and a half euros and the selling price of twenty five euros per unit
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0086484_0086645	to find out what the people want and yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0012298_0012602	the main functions at least
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0195004_0195515	the one on the right is the banana and the one on the left is the orange one
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0222260_0222540	but in our design we didn't include the speech recognition part
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0085412_0085659	to the current trend of fruit and vegetables
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0074990_0075189	yeah i think the product is
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0148998_0149237	think we should lose the l. c. d. screen here
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0222656_0223061	if you make it from the top to the bottom you get rid of the l. c. d. screen for example
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0129264_0129906	you could just save one slide and then we'd end up with a whole bunch of blank slides in your presentation
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0169125_0169527	so it could be either the blue one or the red one because i mean it's like
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0164442_0165203	so um the last part of the time is the closing and the end of the meeting
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0005239_0005447	but that's okay
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0150290_0150802	so changing the covers is pretty standard in the market we are targeting young people who change their covers every season
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0076724_0076992	so like an energy source
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0175745_0176007	and i don't think that's a special colour can we paint it
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0115672_0115851	yeah yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0163243_0163660	you see you get the email from your supervisor that they are busy with their lunch break or something
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0105188_0105650	but i think there's a little bit of space between the buttons which is missing
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0134989_0135328	everybody seems to have some little problem for example
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0024946_0025060	it's okay
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0226432_0226842	but i think that you should just take a look at the average price of an l. c. d. display for a remote control
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0052412_0053316	so if you take the yellow one and make it a little bit more yellow with the colours of the l. c. d. screen on the side
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0189054_0189228	but um you c
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0176016_0176429	the l. c. d. is a new trend one you can see on the market
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0191274_0191588	um okay so we've got the budget
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0036755_0036949	oh don't think so
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0134192_0135048	you could have had a little bit of discussion i suppose you could have talked about the costs and stuff like that
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0210871_0211662	if we just stick to the basic design and make sure that there's enough space for the l. c. d. screen if people are willing to spend a little bit of extra money on that
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0162868_0163243	if you use the l. c. d. screen we just add an extra one to the cost
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0076992_0077461	because one of the things we wanted to look into was like you just mentioned in a little bit more detail on the double scroll wheel
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0058725_0059062	but i think that's one of the nice things about the l. c. d.
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0056054_0056835	uh i don't know much about it but you can make it a little bit more trendy than just uh normal
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0218025_0218991	because if we have a lot of extra time now to uh work on the design of the remote control it's better to have a look at what is already on the market
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0191588_0192062	depends on the size of the print and the size of the display on the remote control
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0131449_0132237	if it's going to be a little bit more expensive than the one i think the look and feel should be good enough to stick out in the market
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0189425_0190016	we just have to make a decision on what we're going to do with the l. c. d. display and how much time we have left for that
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0068504_0069132	should i start with a blank slate or should you draw your favourite animal on the concept board
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0094603_0095211	you could just make a small one and you could lose the scroll wheel but you would still have your product name
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0185833_0186520	but i think pretty much t. v. s have speech recognition which is pretty cool
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0068163_0068323	yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0204917_0205635	that's pretty much the same thing that we were looking for in a user friendly remote control if it was just a little bit more flashy
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0192189_0192592	um there's not really a lot more to say about the design
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0183573_0184148	maybe it will turn out to be a real trend but then you'll have to change your remote control
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0008544_0009352	um i think this is our last meeting so we should wrap up quickly as we are time limited
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0209428_0210011	and you could just have done a little more research on the spongy stuff as well
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0065588_0065718	is it really gonna be an issue
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0227763_0228698	um let's see what it takes in terms of space and energy to make that but that's something we have to keep in mind as well
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0011269_0011501	so i think we took too much time for that
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0219083_0219306	so we're looking at a basic design
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0077618_0077833	oh yeah the s the side
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0148592_0148738	oh okay
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0064002_0064729	but if you're holding it in your left hand or something like that the button is on the right side of your thumb i think
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0197709_0198266	for the l. c. d. display we could buy a pretty nice one i guess
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0071725_0071915	they they don't support that
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0188079_0188197	and you could yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0195977_0196170	so could you please write that down
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0192808_0193128	what do you give the buttons as a name
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0118872_0119263	well maybe that's not really a problem if we drop the l. c. d. screen
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0194471_0194948	okay and then you take out the top one and a half euro
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0055701_0055969	so pretty much the same as a standard remote
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0187652_0187765	yeah okay
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0079932_0080195	yeah i think yeah i think it would
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0050799_0051223	then make it a one point five and put it in the menu where you can't find it now
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0157634_0157921	so it's kind of a little bit of a plastic and rubber combination
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0180270_0180650	so we agree on the
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0078967_0079783	well you should take out the l. c. d. thing and then i think it would be nice to drop the double r. on the left side
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0051215_0051688	yeah yeah you wouldn't yeah you wouldn't have to pay for a l. c. d. screen
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0153441_0153591	you see this here
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0172555_0173179	yeah but can we take out the l. c. d. display for example like a basic channel selection
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0094354_0094603	if you if you take the l. c. d. screen though
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0053146_0053294	that doesn't count does it
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0182425_0182687	it's a it's a it's a bit of a kick off
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0164949_0165076	and the logo
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0128876_0129431	yes if we want a l. c. d. display then we would have to pay extra for that
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0164344_0164499	and you make the okay uh
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0152292_0152729	um so this is kind of a new technology and there are two things here
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0039096_0039596	if you don't take out the l. c. d. display then you have to lose a lot of money on it
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0139363_0139573	yeah that would be yeah that would be a nice feature
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0114170_0115100	but i think it's a little bit more expensive to have the l. c. d. screen and the speech recognition because it's just an extra thing on top of the remote
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0190615_0190857	so it's it's a little a little short on the
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0202008_0202770	maybe we could make it a black and white remote control like you said
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0069823_0069960	like a kind of a
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0228698_0229151	but i think we'll fall back into our budget after this
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0226150_0226432	but i mean we did a good job on the l. c. d. screen
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0012602_0013372	um we could change the colours and add new ones um that fit in with our latest trends
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0199597_0200180	and it's just going to be a little bit more expensive for us because we're also trying to go for the advanced chip
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0212288_0212491	you could take a copy of the project document
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0132981_0133449	but i don't know if it's worth the extra effort just to have a little bit of that on the design
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0029420_0029974	now the first phase should be the functional design and the second phase should be the technical design
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0220154_0220323	oh yeah the yellow one yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0223061_0223585	it's not a lot of people are gonna want to buy an l. c. d. display if they don't have their own remote control
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0011664_0011891	but we'll just have to deal with that later on to be honest
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0186520_0186655	the l. c. d. screen
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0173301_0174236	so if you take a look at the sample sensor and the sample speaker or something like that it's pretty much the same thing for both of them
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0219094_0219334	that's just what it was that was just a cost issue
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0019333_0019451	just cut out the numbers
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0136485_0136741	if you pick up the pen when it's empty
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0000002_0000202	oh wait a minute you hold it in your hand
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0128514_0128876	so i don't think it's a good idea to start out with the l. c. d. screen
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0193474_0193716	the rubber is a big deal
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0187432_0187668	and they use them more often in the kitchen
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0138042_0138503	like you said we're focusing on the younger people which is a little bit of a problem since we're selling this thing to everyone
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0112823_0113240	yeah i d i don't think it's an idea to add a little menu button right here
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0025849_0026370	because our firm is all about innovation and uh taking new trends into our products
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0073243_0073799	it's it's not really true but i think they do want it
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0146202_0146611	we don't want to take too much space for the l. c. d. screen because that will increase the cost even more
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0220425_0220813	so if we could find a compromise between the l. c. d. display and voice recognition
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0074029_0074161	they're not double r. s
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0035432_0035654	be able to design something that's pretty much in our image
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0109818_0110496	there's there can be colours but you can't have them if they're too small 'cause they can lose their l. c. d. screen
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0178865_0179014	okay
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0050494_0050799	how how long can you have a look at that
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0032413_0033086	um we're focusing on the younger demographic from sixteen to twenty five and a half percent of them are willing to spend more
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0065538_0066039	yeah but i think if you take out the l. c. d. thing then it's okay
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0125060_0125310	so i think you're talking about the l. c. d. screen
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0042252_0042507	oh the fancy look
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0210011_0210708	you could have a little bit of plastic on your remote control to give it some spongy feel
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0059834_0060386	yeah the menu button you might wanna make it a little bit more prominent on the on the top of the remote control
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0148117_0148530	okay well i think that's pretty much the whole idea of a fruit remote control
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0068323_0068437	yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0163533_0164442	and then after that i had to take out the l. c. d. display because that's the only thing that was left on the budget
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0205544_0205727	it's i don't think so
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0189165_0189312	like you want a back
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0229151_0229325	okay take out the rubber right
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0085715_0086369	it's not something that's going to make our product more expensive because we're focusing on the l. c. d. screen
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0132839_0133139	yeah i didn't have a lot of room for that actually
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0058059_0058272	and then it would be a little bit too expensive
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0129595_0129708	have i missed something
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0125566_0125997	just like you said uh i'm just looking at the menu how do you do it
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0081231_0081853	maybe we could start with an l. c. d. display on our remote control or something like that
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0184800_0184921	the only thing i think
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0146938_0147093	oh you could make it you could do that
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0232570_0232677	is everyone happy
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0075365_0076057	well you don't really need a remote control 'cause you can just make it on your own
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0225419_0226057	but that's not something i thought about at the start of the project so it's good to keep that in mind
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0135045_0135233	we had to take out the battery
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0133449_0133915	is it possible to put an l. c. d. screen on the remote control if we lose one of the push buttons
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0181831_0182425	so you can find out in the next step if we're within the twelve and a half euro budget or not
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0116388_0116511	rubber yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0136802_0137175	yeah they could just do an extra thing with the l. c. d. screen or something like that
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0170898_0171243	so we can focus on the interface design which is key to the final product
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0048454_0049370	so we took out the l. c. d. display um which was a little bit of a b a small budget issue i think
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0030783_0031218	so the final product is pretty much the same as it was supposed to look like of course
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0223838_0224119	it's only the one of the most expensive components in the whole thing anyway
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0028144_0028599	the final remote control looks and feels like a real product according to us
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0108608_0109417	there's a there's a curve in the shape of the remote control because um they like curves
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0109417_0109818	if you give them a double curve then you can still give them an spongy feel
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0159281_0159776	so the new product should be trendy and user friendly and not too expensive in price
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0112363_0112923	so it's a little bit of a compromise like if you take out the l. c. d. display for example
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0064729_0065014	do you think it's missing out a little bit on the design
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0198266_0198782	for example uh taking out the l. c. d. screen and putting a button on it or something like that
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0162747_0162868	is that the only idea
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0137175_0137398	then we'll have a special colour in the paint
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0198820_0199377	so we decided on a basic design of the remote control with the l. c. d. display
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0226986_0227165	yeah putting the emphasis on it
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0208684_0209080	we're looking more at the younger demographic which is a little bit of a problem
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0155214_0156212	because we are going to make a basic design which is in the middle of the price range and if you want to make a high end design we are going to increase the price by two euros
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0084553_0084817	you wouldn't lose it you'd s
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0031218_0031695	but at the end of the day it's still a product for the selling price
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0117608_0117718	think so
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0186500_0187432	yeah but it's it's just a little bit of extra if you have the l. c. d. screen which is uh well it's not as good for the cost
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0221703_0221964	in the corporate colour and slogan
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0188370_0188958	yeah we took out the l. c. d. display and decided to stick with a simple design which we talked about earlier
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0216871_0217586	because we lost the scroll wheel push button and the l. c. d. display but we got a regular push button and the l. c. d. display
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0212456_0213177	like i said you could just put a fancy look and feel on it but that's not really true
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0036742_0036901	yeah not
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0190840_0191062	you don't wanna look at that anyway
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0132237_0132764	how do you say how do you have to design a remote control which is pretty much the same thing
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0038856_0038972	that's a little hard though
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0100491_0101417	um the case is made of titanium which has a nice feel to it
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0037104_0037309	um yes thank you
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0142893_0143138	and the turn around time is pretty short you can do that
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0101417_0102327	and i think that's the case with the with the l. c. d. screen 'cause people are gonna lose their um which is the main issue
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0040302_0040472	yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0133915_0134516	we have a little something on the side to pick up or something like that
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0110496_0110920	but it's not well within the budget so we have to either cut one of those
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0125432_0125558	oh wha what
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0058272_0058872	and the thing is you take out the cover and it's pretty much the same thing just in a different way
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0022936_0023239	the method we used to decide on the
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0226877_0227640	so we come up with something like this and then make it a little bit more advanced in the design i guess
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0008008_0008387	well keep in mind that you have about half an hour
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0148283_0148597	okay okay
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0161564_0161743	but you think it looks better after
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0216382_0216871	um the l. c. d. display takes up a bit of the space
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0153118_0153286	so some people have like um
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0176145_0176343	and that's the volume control
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0016044_0016539	we're still talking about the same thing as we had last time but something a little different
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0053742_0053910	oh alright
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0226030_0226150	okay
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0099218_0099999	but you could have done a lot better if you had just lost the channel button and the volume button and not lost the mute button and the teletext button
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0039387_0039590	oh no
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0145952_0146152	yeah no no
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0142008_0142721	you know when you lose your remote control and you don't have a way to make it back to your t. v. or something like that
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0111147_0111276	channel yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0077497_0077618	yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0116500_0116979	let's have a look at the financial part of that and see if there's enough to cover the costs
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0138503_0139147	the marketing expert can tell us something about the trendiness of the current trends and we can take this into consideration when designing the buttons
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0139147_0139304	so we can do the l. c. d. kind of thing
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0206423_0207105	so you got some buttons that are a little bit more easy to use
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0180781_0180899	do we agree on the battery
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0224476_0225035	um that's the information you get from the menu which you use in the design of the remote control
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0070774_0071499	like they like they have a cover on the on the r. c. but they don't really care if it's in black or in yellow
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0165562_0165774	so the final design looks and feels totally new
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0131235_0131449	because i think it would be a great addition to our product
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0107867_0108482	um there is the problem with the communication
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0077596_0077934	so we have to look at the whole remote control in a little more detail
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0118463_0118836	when people buy a new remote control they just like to give it a very nice cover right
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0076239_0076697	yeah they they don't like the spongy thing but they they do like the rubber stuff
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0175151_0175720	so that we can make a product which is not only trendy but also has the characteristics of being spongy
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0086804_0087020	but maybe something to talk about on the side of it
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0035729_0035965	okay thank you very much
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0231623_0232110	we just don't have enough space to do all the fancy stuff we wanted on the l. c. d. display
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0001757_0001913	oh great
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0028599_0028955	all the remote controls have to be original in order to attract young people
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0054598_0055216	so maybe make it a special colour like titanium blue or titanium red or something
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0072299_0073132	yeah but the the l. c. d. screen would be a new feature on the on the remote control and that should be the selling point
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0147093_0147921	you could just flip the l. c. d. display and you could flip the l. c. d. display and you have a lot of possibilities
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0223557_0224476	well i think it's well you could do that but then you'd lose the l. c. d. display which is what we aim to make
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0134328_0134463	the pink one is kind of a problem
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0210551_0210871	so the little bit of research is just to see what's available in the price range we're looking for
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0087220_0087329	okay well i'll move on
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0160312_0160780	after this meeting we go back to the production room and start building our prototype
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0111124_0111763	okay so you can change the l. c. d. screen and it's a little bit more expensive but it's kind of nice
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0078600_0078967	um the buttons are standard colour
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0193636_0194134	yeah i think we went with the l. c. d. uh on the on the on the display
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0141902_0142008	if we fill up
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0153591_0153741	uh this is on a one
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0117621_0118084	you can put that like this with the logo and then give them a colour
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0118192_0118395	it would be cool to have it on the on the remote control itself
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0195625_0195847	okay okay
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0069148_0069726	the scroll wheel could be placed on top of the l. c. d. screen or you could do it like this with a normal push button remote control
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0217586_0217853	so that's what we have to deal with is how to get our product out there
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0140740_0141112	in the in the case of the l. c. d. screen you have a lot of buttons
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0034013_0034785	there are some extra features to make the l. c. d. screen a little bit more trendy and also to increase the selling price
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0021898_0022800	okay so we made a decision on the remote control's design um based on what our marketing expert told us
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0135041_0135232	but easy to learn is pretty high
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0071449_0071648	so that affects the entire design
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0166384_0166613	in all aspects of the company and individual work
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0128504_0128659	oh the other side
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0017939_0018862	um and we're aiming for a young market which is basically um
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0077962_0078479	if you if you do the same thing with the l. c. d. uh screen
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0031695_0032413	okay so the final report is pretty much the same as last time which is about a total of forty minutes
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0029974_0030639	which is pretty much the same as what is used in electronic telephones which is just to transmit information
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0034785_0035432	so we're implementing a little bit of extra functionality in our remote control to make it more appealing to the market
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0213742_0214102	it should be in the menu it should be in the display or whatever you call it
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0159878_0160312	so we have a combination of soft materials on the on the buttons
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0184662_0184793	that was kind of a big thing though
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0137738_0138096	yeah that that's the the the end of the meeting
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0080978_0081433	because if we take the design and it's going to cost
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0129140_0129293	it will be flat on the back side
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0067333_0067624	and the the same thing for the l. c. d. screen
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0198019_0198162	plastic okay
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0116994_0117621	so the final shape of the of the product should be a little bit curved in the in the back instead of the front
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0144866_0144989	well it's a bit more
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0166613_0166912	okay we have a little more design phase which is like a working design
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0167049_0167557	which makes us twelve and a half euros which is more than the twelve and a half budget we have
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0201858_0202008	so we could make it red then
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0122835_0123831	and i think that's one of the best ones out there because a lot of t. v. s come with an l. c. d. screen
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0158012_0158431	just keep in mind that people like to pay extra for speech recognition technology
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0088899_0089550	because when you lose the scroll wheels and the push buttons there's just a lot of extra space that people take with their remote control
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0203384_0203662	so we could just take a pen
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0156418_0156912	if you if you lose the l. c. d. screen and have an l. c. d. screen which is a bit of a problem
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0205521_0206423	um i'm just trying to find out if it's possible to make it in less than twelve and a half euros
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0169527_0170446	so it can be a little bit more expensive but you can still make some kind of design on the on the on the on the on the on the on the on the on the on the
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0209080_0209463	even if this would have been a good idea to discuss some more things which could have been done differently
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0182295_0182473	yeah i mean if i think
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0055103_0055725	yeah you could make it a little bit thicker at the side and then the rest of it would be the same yellow or something like that
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0181145_0181306	yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0017331_0017939	and i think we're looking forward to the end of the project and getting back on track
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0042623_0042742	in the middle of it
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0060386_0060805	you don't have to make it exactly the same shape or anything like that i think
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0147921_0148233	if you don't know how to make it or not i'm not sure anyway
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0203764_0204429	my guess is that i'm gonna have to be a bit more creative on this one because that's my side of the story
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0059062_0059834	you get the you get the l. c. d. screen which is not in your menu but it's just an extra thing that you can add to your design
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0111763_0112363	so like i said in the last meeting you can just take out a little bit of extra information like channel changing and program changing
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0096908_0097666	and to make a new one and sell it for uh twenty five euros that's not too bad a bit of a stretch
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0172153_0172555	they wanted something like that so i think we should do a different design for one of those
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0084951_0085271	but then there's still a little bit more to make out of the money than just that
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0060854_0061353	like this and like this and it's a kind of a double r. for the whole remote control
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0211630_0212456	and you could just say one and that would go for a one because it's the lowest score you can get
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0122465_0122835	um the extra buttons on top of the speech recognition
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0158431_0159281	and the younger people want to pay more for a trendy look and feel and that's basically what the younger people want on their on their clothes and in their home decor
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0018862_0019193	okay so we should start with the first presentation
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0163508_0163805	yeah but you don't yeah you can do a lot with it
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0065289_0065588	and then you pick it up and stick it on top of your t. v.
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0075916_0076308	maybe we got a better deal on the double curved case if it's under twelve and a half
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0113240_0113765	yeah you could just make it a little bit thicker with the with the curve
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0016897_0017210	you were going to release the basic remote control
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0187746_0187925	maybe we could stick with black or something
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0207105_0207294	which is what the market wants anyway
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0044473_0045055	at least some of us have come up with something that looks a little different than the other ones
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0045266_0045596	um i'm just looking for my final report again
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0215226_0215710	okay well that might be a bit of a problem if we're on the twenty five
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0054083_0054598	because we are taking the l. c. d. screen which is really something new to add something like this in the design
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0144989_0145772	so you're gonna have to write your name on a piece of white board or something so that you don't lose it when you drop your uh remote control
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0099999_0100304	if we drop the l. c. d. display would we give up on this
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0047486_0047853	um we looked at trends and then we came up with an
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0160946_0161428	that we can sell the buttons on one side and the l. c. d. on the other side
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0161877_0162283	you'd like to use the basic mode push button remote control
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0079650_0080160	did it just take out the extra functionality or did it just take out the extra thing you could have done for the design
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0215644_0216382	can we just make a standard uh remote control with the l. c. d. display and the speech recognition
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0041083_0041188	okay
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0115944_0116500	because we just made a little bit more profit by losing the l. c. d. display and the voice recognition
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0053378_0053790	like you said it was a bit uh
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0091816_0091988	what kind of things do we have to consider
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0049370_0050219	maybe it's better to take a little bit of time to design that one because it's like i said in the last point is very important
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0155824_0155938	which means
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0053232_0053491	does it just like a standard design
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0146099_0146202	okay
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0229632_0230258	okay
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0036429_0036582	yeah okay
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0009601_0009826	yeah i'm guessing that's what the l. c. d. is
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0024933_0025119	so project announcement
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0185031_0185833	let's see if we could make the whole thing out of wood then that would have been a lot more expensive than if it's not
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0200180_0200831	we're gonna take out the l. c. d. screen because it's not very expensive and we don't really have a lot of money left in the budget for that
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0204429_0204917	pick up the remote control and make it a little bit spongy in the middle instead of flat
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0129906_0130571	it would be it would be a little bit too flashy to put black and yellow on a double r. c.
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0113765_0114170	it should be it should be just for a basic design or something
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0056191_0056303	like normal product
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0189926_0190502	the one on the bottom is a kind of a curve because um you can make a nice curve out of wood
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0232171_0232396	think we're pretty much in agreement now i think
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0168273_0169125	but the fact that we have a lot of room for creativity in the in the look and the feel of this remote control
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0145424_0146099	so i think it's a good idea to make use of the l. c. d. display on the on the remote control because that's just what we were told
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0056835_0057300	people that are not familiar with the menu button people that are not familiar with l. c. d.
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0025656_0025849	so that's the one thing we decided for
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0062662_0062874	because they use them quite frequently i guess
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0071528_0071765	so a little bit of special colour would be nice
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0096359_0096753	but if that's a speech recognition on the l. c. d. screen
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0102459_0103250	well maybe you could pick the one with the with the curve in the middle because it would be a nice design
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0033505_0033912	so should we be doing something to make the l. c. d. screen a little bit more user friendly
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0162257_0162492	oh you'd you'd put it in a folder and then you'd look it up
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0155760_0155881	so why don't start with you
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0154928_0155214	okay and the l. c. d. display is a special feature
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0137923_0138131	okay that's your turn
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0150802_0151570	so you have like a basic menu structure and then there are two different types of menus which are pretty much the same
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0019210_0019333	okay
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0111136_0111242	for the flip phone
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0071616_0071774	except for l. c. d.
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0046596_0047486	um it's pretty much the same as your average remote control but with a little bit of blue on it
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0047986_0048454	um there's a new remote control that has lost its cover
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0119182_0119294	oh
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0013372_0014280	it was in the end of the day it came out that we had to come up with a completely different remote control from what we had in mind
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0144533_0144638	they don't look at them
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0174354_0174537	oh well yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0115444_0115944	if you make it a little bit too small i'm going to have to sell it for twenty five euros more
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0098463_0099218	so you can make a whole l. c. d. screen on the on the bottom of it and then there's a little menu button or something
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0072058_0072205	it's a two point one
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0170446_0170664	and technically not exactly the same
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0071774_0072311	what kind of new product are we gonna produce by the end of the year
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0033086_0033505	the fruit and vegetables are going to be fashionable in clothes shoes and furniture
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0025119_0025656	uh we decided to make a remote control that's independent of the l. c. d. display and the sound recognition
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0144155_0144495	we are making this as a way to increase our market share
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0050012_0050260	like an okay
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0009477_0009969	um yeah i think the l. c. d. is more than
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0130571_0131188	maybe we could have done a little more work on the buttons and how it's supposed to be placed in your living room or something
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0153858_0154292	the channel control and the volume control are not uh on the top of the menu structure
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0156212_0156505	what are the costs of all these high tech parts
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0050219_0050626	so you write your name on it for example when you lose it
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0127015_0127827	but you could have done with the with the l. c. d. on the on the menu that would have been nice
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0232867_0233179	okay
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0219578_0219981	like uh maybe you have a little bit more discussion on the l. c. d. screen or something like this
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0230519_0231255	so i think we're pretty much in agreement about what we came up with so let's just take a look at the finances and see if we're within budget
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0152729_0152905	the normal product not special
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0122071_0122465	if you had one of those with an l. c. d. screen that would be cool
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0104324_0105188	well maybe you see something like this with the l. c. d. display and uh some special lights on it
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0023460_0023678	channel and programme selection and teletext
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0188073_0188307	that that would be a good logo on the on the back
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0029089_0029420	and of course this would be easy to use with speech recognition
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0105785_0106024	there there's a lot of p. c. s
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0184148_0184662	so that's why i'm gonna take the l. c. d. remote do you have a l. c. d.
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0068177_0068398	it's not the round it's not the
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0151570_0152116	so you design a yellow and black remote control which is very trendy nowadays
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0075002_0075156	okay plastic interior
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0137437_0137923	okay so we'll take it from there and see if we can fit all the buttons in
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0036543_0036742	and what happens after that is exactly the same
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0182707_0183573	yeah if it's if it's clear that they're going for the l. c. d. screen because there's a cost issue or whatever
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0081629_0081912	um i think it will be okay
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0227609_0227779	and they get off the sound yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0091988_0092807	can we save this as a word document or is it can we save it as an image if we want to download it on the l. c. d. screen
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0064990_0065140	yeah and
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0176429_0177106	so that's basically the menu structure that you get on most of the t. v. s that are out there now comes from the l. c. d. screen
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0194134_0194770	oh on the on the one on the top we have the r. c. yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0225035_0225419	otherwise we'll have to lose all the good things and just have an ugly little piece of electronics
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0021791_0021898	okay
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0080799_0080978	could we think about that
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0167557_0168273	we have to keep in mind the fact that this is a final product which we are going to launch in the market
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0051688_0052412	but i don't think you know what you really need is just the same thing as i told you before
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0174609_0175151	well the new product should sell for at least twenty five euros and i think this is possible
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0106153_0106991	and what's more important is that it's easy to use a s a simple design
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0053961_0054086	and anyway
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0199200_0199392	oh i think so i think so
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0171623_0172153	my personal preferences is that the remote control should have a little bit more high tech look
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0057116_0057532	even if we're not making a universal remote control i think it's a good idea
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0049745_0049886	well can you explain
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0097666_0098463	because when you have something like this hanging on the wall and that's what we were talking about last time anyway
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0219334_0219636	but it's just an idea that we could take out the curve and get a nice design
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0211662_0211788	which is a bit of an issue
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0106991_0107867	yeah i'm not sure that would be such a big deal if you had lost your remote control or something like that but still
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0117431_0117601	yeah a small l. c. d. on the back
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0143138_0144102	is it possible to make a remote control that looks like the one you find on your l. c. d. t. v. but with the scroll wheel and the plus and minus button for example
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0026370_0026908	we also implemented a lot of advanced functions on our l. c. d. display which are still in the budget
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0092714_0093013	well the the the thing is it's a bit um
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0117863_0117973	alright
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0156891_0157538	like you have a l. c. d. screen on your uh on your remote control which is just an extra option
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0055977_0056085	yeah okay
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0197144_0197260	so for the hand
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0149677_0150290	for example taking the l. c. d. display and making it more expensive to include in the design
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0038097_0038352	the l. c. d. screen
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0116863_0117008	and you can pull them out yeah
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0212137_0212251	you can you can
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0181306_0181831	um that means that the the form is not flat
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0115209_0115444	it doesn't look very easy to make if you have to draw it
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0196178_0197020	okay the one on the left is the the basic remote control and the one on the right is the f the fancy one with the black and green buttons
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0043948_0044473	so um in addition to the l. c. d. display which is also a little bit more expensive
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0057514_0058039	yeah and maybe the l. c. d. display is more useful when you have a lot of options
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0036149_0036391	let's start with the opening and see what we're up to
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0202770_0203384	but that's not what we're looking for if you know what's meant by the speech recognition
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0189474_0189743	and not a full remote control with the fruit on top
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0010093_0010200	oh sorry
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0150760_0151132	because they were pretty much the same thing that people were looking for in a remote control
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0080119_0080264	yeah that's
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0029767_0030462	wouldn't it be better to stick with two scroll wheels and a simple push button design
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0088855_0089231	so maybe it's not gonna be more expensive because of the l. c. d. screen
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0206619_0207514	but um i think you know what we're looking for is a basic remote control that doesn't do all the extra stuff
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0056932_0057098	so i don't know what i'll write down later
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0151558_0151753	make it a double r. c.
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0157060_0157389	twelve and a half
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0166372_0166561	product evaluation
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0211269_0211781	and i think that's a good idea to look into the possibility of putting another logo on the front or something like that
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0202851_0203137	they're not interested in the advanced features anyway
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0119730_0119868	so what's the channel selection
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0107878_0108004	don't want you to lose your button
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0007631_0008203	and um the rubber will be used as well in the l. c. d. screen
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0055519_0056226	okay we're going to design a remote control and then we'll see what decisions we have to make on the costs
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0020371_0020670	oh yeah let's say it's a two
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0184842_0184984	but it was not having any issues
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0160473_0160647	so the power would have to be high
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0102431_0102558	yeah i think we
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0211781_0212244	let's see what kind of things we have to do in the next uh half an hour or something like that
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0201108_0201817	because i think it's really good to make this a little bit more special by just dropping the voice recognition
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0097280_0097564	one and a half
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0184614_0184842	maybe after the end of the meeting
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0153981_0154491	um as you can see we have the l. c. d. display which is customisable for example
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0065308_0065495	out of four
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0077244_0077443	one point seven
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0023655_0023993	yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0028476_0029174	um the l. c. d. display takes up a lot of space and you still have to stick the speech recognition button in there
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0125843_0126008	it's implementation cost
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0089806_0089981	right
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0051764_0052317	so that would be a big difference if the l. c. d. screen was made out of the same material as the rest of the thing
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0060022_0060152	how about that
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0071665_0071800	it's a little bit very subjective
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0142747_0142880	if we take rubber
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0046975_0047249	so this is the first evaluation of the design
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0052880_0053466	so we're going to have to figure out a way of how you're supposed to hold your l. c. d. display
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0049991_0050845	the channel selection and the volume control are two of the most frequently used buttons on a standard remote control so they should be included in the design
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0157389_0157688	twelve and a half twelve and a half euros
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0092561_0092947	and finally a little bit less easy to learn i guess
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0062886_0063141	after that i would be more inclined to buy it
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0199206_0199556	but perhaps they could have had an option to pick that one
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0082589_0083208	that's not the that's not the shape of the remote control but you could put a logo on it
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0146418_0146869	okay so it's a spongy material on the sides
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0096899_0097072	colourful
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0139789_0139960	oh it's just one piece of rubber
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0042707_0043170	let's take it to the party
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0141642_0141956	we didn't have we didn't have a lot of buttons and things like that
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0040229_0040867	oh not in the in the look of the remote control if you know what i mean
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0153309_0153981	but if it's an option to make a speech recognition system in our l. c. d. display that's already been discussed
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0015277_0015894	um it's a little bit of a curve on the top and a curve on the s on the side
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0124252_0124459	we're not using an l. c. d. display anyway
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0079543_0080152	so i think you made it pretty much in the right direction by using our l. c. d. display and voice recognition
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0003390_0003552	okay um
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0085499_0085694	we don't really talk about that at all i think
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0096244_0096449	so it would be a yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0026723_0026955	oh yeah i mean it's somewhere in your home right
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0146869_0147206	well make it take that away and put it into twelve and a half
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0058075_0058416	well i think our audience is a little higher than average
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0203137_0203687	even if people are willing to spend money on a remote control they don't like the look and feel of our product anyway
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0168369_0168523	yes
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0048836_0049116	now we're getting close to the finish the last phase of the meeting
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0020479_0020798	well black and green in black and green are trendy
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0033228_0033450	it could also be in here for example
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0193678_0194216	maybe we should think of something else because it's not exactly what we were looking for anyway
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0099508_0100102	and that is crucial for the final design of our remote control
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0061602_0061753	okay
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0045421_0045600	okay
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0119093_0119208	so single curve
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0203973_0204308	well anyway it's more expensive than
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0040867_0041709	and that's pretty much the same as what we came up with in the last phase of the last phase of the last phase of the last phase
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0009468_0009897	okay i mean we're making a multi purpose remote control and people are willing to pay for that
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0094033_0094237	and the rest of it we have covered up
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0102690_0103123	after the first meeting i got some more information about what has to go on the l. c. d. screen
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0182963_0183503	yeah i think we should make the l. c. d. display a little more easy to use for the people
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0082154_0082482	yeah and uh yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0047249_0047547	okay so the new product is in the market with the latest technology
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0189996_0190296	yeah i think it's a nice addition to the l. c. d. yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0215214_0215890	okay but i thought we had a whole bunch of stuff in our head about fruit and vegetables
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0010325_0010586	let's make the curve a two
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0162370_0162501	yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0093601_0093754	real reaction remote
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0048158_0048619	so what we decided is that it's more expensive to deliver the l. c. d. screen and the speech recognition
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0152756_0153037	but we still need to take that into account with the budget budget
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0169504_0169624	yeah let's say a two
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0191709_0191888	they don't have to come from somewhere else
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0213821_0213994	it's it's too expensive
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0042426_0042675	so this is the one
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0173955_0174893	after that i had a list of all the things which were supposed to be implemented in the remote control
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0103308_0103946	our basic remote control can be either black and white or black and silver or anything like that we could come up with
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0146133_0146305	oh
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0059577_0060022	maybe we could give an extra option in the l. c. d. display if we take out the speech recognition
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0116994_0117120	okay alright
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0071037_0071182	is that what you say
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0070603_0070757	yeah i thought you did that already
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0219792_0219958	it's a dinosaur
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0058297_0058533	oh just a smartboard
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0212398_0213152	even if we take out a little bit of the speech recognition thing i think it's still good to make something that people want
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0039904_0040303	but not looking at the financial part of it which is a lot of information
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0213477_0213648	oh maybe it will
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0151180_0151459	but we still are talking about the budget
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0220460_0220881	did you not know that the fruit and vegetables were in the market
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0205290_0205582	because the looks and feel of the thing doesn't matter
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0220084_0220492	how did you manage to do it without the l. c. d. information
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0155506_0155799	because we're going to do a lot of work on that in the end anyway
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0008858_0009029	product price twelve and a half
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0072117_0072286	just fill in one two three four five
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0167748_0167997	we decided to keep the l. c. d. display
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0169656_0170315	but we also had some new information that there's still a market for the l. c. d. display actually
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0150154_0150760	but i mean if we don't have the l. c. d. then we still need to buy more buttons
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0004709_0004997	uh a product can be good or bad
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0002738_0002856	okay you start again
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0195447_0195953	yeah they don't really talk about the remote control itself but they do talk a lot about the channel programming
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0114509_0114789	what what's the highest ranking on the l. c. d.
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0155625_0156026	they like that kind of stuff which they see in their daily life
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0080152_0080387	is that going to be the l. c. d. display you are using
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0118064_0118366	yeah one of the sample sensor and one of the sample speaker
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0165580_0165807	exactly which is one of the most expensive
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0060152_0060278	okay
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0119850_0120257	yeah i think it's yeah i'd say i'd say a two
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0125385_0125843	so we're not using the l. c. d. display actually
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0208471_0208983	and the other thing is that you're basically going to be holding the device in your left hand or in your right hand
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0137358_0137594	grooving into the corporate identity and stuff like that
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0034391_0034801	and um then finally the end of this meeting
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0063870_0064567	yeah yeah yeah you have to put a two or a three
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0017582_0017838	but we can't but we can't lose them
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0104500_0104817	is there anything else you'd like to be able to find out about the project
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0141989_0142114	it's not a real thing i think
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0080340_0081046	oh no like the black and yellow or a black and yellow but with a logo on it
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0033990_0034391	so when you give it away it's a bit of a waste of the entire product
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0151568_0151710	we can put our logo in it
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0057098_0057436	okay it's two point one three divided by three is two and a half
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0062660_0062886	one is true and seven is false
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0022666_0023422	okay so you could put a little bit of extra stuff like that in the budget because it's not part of the actual product itself
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0072878_0073085	so is it one curve or is it two curves
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0204238_0204421	yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0154748_0155625	maybe we should put the l. c. d. screen on the side because it has a higher price and we didn't have that much money left
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0193197_0193678	maybe there's some more money in selling an l. c. d. display and a speech recognition on top of it
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0128633_0128764	yeah okay
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0124679_0124956	colourful people want a colourful remote control
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0074155_0074366	okay ease of use
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0147361_0147641	if we take the basic model that it is in right now
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0074366_0074483	easy to use
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0151326_0151659	so just change the design so that we have a nice curve
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0148868_0149309	we don't have to do it ourselves it can be done with a little bit more cost
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0102290_0102604	yeah i think yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0130421_0130825	yeah one plus the l. c. d. display and the speaker
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0023549_0023655	yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0113715_0113995	and it would have been a shame to lose the beep signal
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0025272_0025780	so what you see here is a little bit more like what you would have on a standard remote
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0115809_0115964	oh no no the menu
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0169188_0169806	or do you like it or uh
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0091763_0091965	one two three four five six
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0027237_0027350	so on the entire
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0172218_0172557	we take care of the design we take care of yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0122756_0123099	because i think it's just a nice way to lose one piece of rubber in the design
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0081861_0082312	so we should change our design and use wood for the covers instead of rubber
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0149309_0150037	you could give us a list of all the new products we would like to see on the market by the end of the day
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0084388_0084676	okay that's not a problem
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0146166_0146338	let's see what we have to decide
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0154997_0155203	and then we say remote control
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0204308_0204544	that people have to keep in mind
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0073581_0073734	so that is a
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0024997_0025272	so that we could put them in the l. c. d. display
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0021493_0021601	okay alright yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0003272_0003390	so we gotta get rid of
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0029123_0029262	for example
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0010830_0010982	can't you just skip that
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0216751_0216948	so you deliver that in a standard package
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0140518_0141065	you mean that it you could make it uh a bit more advanced
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0204579_0204892	the thing is that you really don't want to make it too big
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0184151_0184614	okay so yeah you could say something like that about what we should do with the design
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0077566_0077898	well we don't really have to agree on it but we can if we want to
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0163626_0163776	nei
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0126728_0127172	but it's not going to be a problem because we can put the l. c. d. screen in there anyway
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0175366_0176275	if we make the if we make the l. c. d. display and the speech recognition i think it will be a little bit more expensive in the production cost
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0191020_0191204	that's my
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0055079_0055182	oh it's a pity
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0027108_0027237	okay
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0082600_0082771	yeah because you have to be here
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0217288_0217464	that will be the l. c. d. display anyway
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0178669_0178828	like that
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0139563_0139785	it doesn't matter anyway
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0074599_0074946	let's say you want a basic battery instead of that
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0197713_0198494	and then you could give them a menu on the l. c. d. screen and they'd just go into their own menu and pick out the design that they want
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0194451_0194929	maybe we just drop the l. c. d. screen and do a regular remote control
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0196007_0196202	yeah that's the function of the l. c. d.
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0203687_0203961	and i think our slogan is important but it's not very long
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0180677_0181283	maybe we should take out the fancy bright colours and just stick to a more basic design in the end
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0126045_0126679	so that you could just say that in the in the description of the remote control that it's not that expensive
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0073734_0073991	take that button and send it to another one
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0160150_0160473	well it's not impossible but you don't see the fruit on top
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0209994_0210623	so maybe you could include it in the l. c. d. display as well or something
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0097153_0097308	yeah one
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0069005_0069175	oh no it's not
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0096324_0096449	to fill in the blank
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0004093_0004564	it's gonna consume a lot of energy compared to a simple chip
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0172964_0173137	and so you were working on the basic design
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0140434_0140639	that's not a lot
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0144422_0144689	because otherwise we're missing out on twenty five euros anyway
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0112668_0113201	we need to find out which one is the cheapest on the market
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0192299_0193197	um as you can see most of the time is spent on the remote control itself which is about about half of your time
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0015894_0016555	like a little something like a thing with a speech recognition and uh we're not very clear on that
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0056304_0056520	one is true and seven is false
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0044834_0045037	um i think this is a good idea
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0012537_0012988	you can just have to think of something else then
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0067463_0067945	okay technically a triple r. c. is actually a double r. c. in theory
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0153037_0153309	and i think the voice recognition is very useful
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0000368_0000686	if you lose the little menu button you have to take out the whole thing
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0173296_0173446	how did you do find it
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0073099_0073313	so if you're watching this for a minute
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0047547_0048158	the marketing expert and the user interface designer are working on the basic design of the remote control
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0041912_0042199	um now i got my evaluation criteria
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0111261_0111373	yeah i presume now
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0141567_0141760	don't think i don't think
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0208960_0209296	just just put the project document in the project folder i think
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0137735_0138224	let's see if we didn't make any money off of that or not
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0087136_0087889	well the menu button is a little bit tricky because we have to move the menu button into the l. c. d. display
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0122178_0122445	maybe a pink one and a black one for example
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0095126_0095345	um i think it would
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0139161_0139263	colour and flat
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0006122_0006812	um filling up a big group of people by filling out a big questionnaire
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0031988_0032552	um the one on the bottom would be the l. c. d. screen
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0031657_0031836	and uh the image
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0084803_0085294	uh making a decision on the remote control's material and design
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0157505_0157721	it's two point five
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0053466_0053913	so we're going to use a simple one for the l. c. d. screen and a regular one
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0171331_0171714	yeah but i think it's quite important to evaluate the design first
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0020670_0021549	so it would be a b a bit of both the scroll wheel and the l. c. d. screen in the in the s on top of it
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0010362_0010480	it can hold like this
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0005672_0006122	um based on the current market trends and sales analysis
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0152684_0152856	we c we could
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0140346_0140507	it's still a little bit open
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0127172_0127484	because we're not gonna use the l. c. d. on the remote control itself
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0120693_0121171	and one and uh yeah that's the one double curve on the side or something
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0125714_0125931	now that's an it's a nice idea
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0071496_0071665	after that i'll get the summary of the working design
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0006812_0007631	okay and um trying to find out if it's possible to implement this kind of technology into our remote control right now
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0154493_0154605	okay we can
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0104035_0104199	oh no
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0050845_0051764	and the l. c. d. display would be a nice addition to our menu system um which we already decided to limit ourselves to twelve euro fifty
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0111791_0111963	um that
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0068895_0069292	you're not the design expert but
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0120168_0120283	don't tell me
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0168536_0168736	um in that sense
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0209117_0209327	that's just the thing that i forgot
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0066132_0066551	uh three and a half is uh under the target
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0125948_0126093	okay right
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0077898_0078492	um we're looking for a trendy product in the current market
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0125074_0125261	so it's a case material see
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0103784_0104040	do you have a big market to talk about
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0011655_0011774	yeah take away the curve
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0060095_0060228	yeah so you can
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0179596_0180250	um i'm still out of time
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0012988_0013135	yeah that's true
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0196176_0196984	and then you get just a little bit of speech recognition but it's not working very well because it's taking up too much space
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0063252_0063448	one is true and seven is false
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0147540_0148015	yeah but you need a mute mute button th that's true
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0216954_0217203	the second point i think is very important
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0094276_0094535	yeah that's yeah that's for the l. c. d.
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0159456_0159566	which is less than twelve
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0017838_0018731	um you've got a lot of choices with the colours and the shape um which is kind of what you call double curved
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0033080_0033210	yeah that's another one yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0088191_0088855	maybe it's a little bit more expensive but we get the same thing with the with the speech recognition and stuff like that
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0021549_0021771	yeah yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0158800_0158933	it's fine to make it a three then
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0161940_0162069	keep me in mind okay
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0162472_0162610	so we are under the budget
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0013863_0014453	okay so this is the final design phase for the prototype presentation
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0148079_0148241	the way to do this
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0145099_0145444	if i if you take out the l. c. d. then i don't see it
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0128357_0128636	maybe we just put a special colour on the l. c. d. display
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0141636_0141773	is there anything on the menu
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0089313_0089572	okay the advanced chip in it
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0195222_0195447	yeah just put it in a d. v. d.
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0070718_0070863	you want to buy your own remote
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0166948_0167513	we didn't make a lot of decisions about what we could have done with the extra budget
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0119293_0119443	it's a two 'cause
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0173184_0173296	thank you
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0070532_0070718	of the average you get
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0200613_0201118	and making a new product which is totally different from your existing product
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0111556_0111672	that's the black remote control
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0213744_0213984	maybe it's a round button on top or something
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0214736_0215214	and um the menu structure we came up with
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0124483_0124648	we should be using it like it was
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0033980_0034152	it's still part of the design
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0104279_0104500	well i think that's the colour of the l. c. d.
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0086156_0086309	we could definitely lose the fruit feel though
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0214271_0214736	um the project evaluation has to be completed by now
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0178399_0178669	and it didn't have a lot of extra features just the normal one i think
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0055336_0055621	is it going to be a universal remote or just yours
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0216025_0216367	uh in your name
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0163089_0163418	so that's a curve on the on the edge of it i guess
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0072755_0073010	let's start with one of our designers
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0082405_0082585	and the spongy feel is not a problem
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0170315_0171238	and after that we need to have an average rating of at least twelve and a half points in order to be eligible for the l. c. d. screen
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0210855_0211119	but i think we're really in the spirit of giving it a simple design
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0083801_0083950	yeah i'd give it a one as well
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0156540_0156796	so if we take out the l. c. d. screen
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0105090_0105269	it's
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0218479_0218677	um yeah let's just um
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0158190_0158482	yeah well two two point five is twelve and a half
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0089981_0090294	now i think it would be good to have a kick off meeting first
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0221542_0221919	yeah i think the l. c. d. screen is a must for the young people
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0176275_0176799	yeah it could be a little bit more difficult to make
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0029174_0029767	um it would have to be sold at least double double r. c. triple r. c.
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0145444_0145718	but if you take away the curve then you lose the basic thing
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0179060_0179486	well you select a particular remote control that has a lot of buttons
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0093733_0094033	yeah it's the eye in the middle i think
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0071959_0072177	okay and we're just finishing up our meeting
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0129433_0129934	maybe we should focus on the l. c. d. screen and a little bit more on the voice recognition
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0156347_0156467	okay so right
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0042934_0043055	thank you
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0054337_0054894	and i'd like to draw a picture of the actual remote control here as well
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0071117_0071242	yeah i got this
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0023326_0023877	so the top is plastic and the bottom is rubber it's kind of a spongy look on the outside
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0084676_0084803	okay
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0191575_0191709	yeah no
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0179596_0179920	that's a bit of the problem i think
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0142723_0142945	and the interface
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0145029_0145509	and i'm pretty much going to be doing the same job again because you guys are gonna be working on a new product later on
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0013210_0013453	oh well the hours
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0182025_0182333	yes that depends on what you mean
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0085694_0086008	we don't have we didn't discuss it at all in the last meeting
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0150037_0150218	you could have used that to count
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0033662_0033840	okay yeah okay you're right
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0163776_0164224	that's just that you could take out the curve and that would be okay
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0221156_0221346	don't don't
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0145866_0146022	but that's a smartboard
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0212327_0212444	yeah it was
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0076642_0077076	maybe i should have to stick to the l. c. d. screen
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0182690_0182872	could it have been a better design
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0106383_0106722	okay now i forgot to get out of here
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0144016_0144324	the big one will take up a bit of the working design
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0130033_0130153	interface type
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0093454_0093931	yeah it was yeah it was a voice recognition issue
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0105357_0105464	let's leave it at that
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0057767_0058075	beep beep beep
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0005194_0005672	the basic colour should be yellow and the slogan should be trendy
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0039240_0039783	or make it a little on off switch in the middle or something like that in the l. c. d. screen
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0117466_0117955	yeah and uh yeah just a one or a two
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0075853_0076076	and i would say a two
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0065410_0065609	okay four
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0094641_0095029	or can we just go on the l. c. d. menu and uh choose the colour that we want
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0206223_0206361	in conclusion
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0174893_0175366	but that doesn't mean we got the lowest price we could get on the market
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0009260_0009381	that would be that you think
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0205457_0205662	if it's not a cover or whatever then it's okay
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0185717_0186263	but i think it's a little bit um we kind of lost the l. c. d. screen
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0077076_0077483	just gonna talk a little bit more because we still don't have all my points to discuss
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0072303_0072420	two point five okay
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0094237_0094433	is this going to be a curved case
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0147212_0147361	well the kinetic thing
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0118818_0118949	the double curved yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0026345_0026723	and then yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0129220_0129394	okay so we stick to rubber actually
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0219123_0219253	awesome
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0095216_0095536	so even if there's a lot of money on the l. c. d. display
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0060278_0060896	so we're going to lose the l. c. d. display and just use a simple white board for the notes
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0190483_0190922	it's it's not a matter of design but it's an issue we need to look into
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0183562_0183667	have to take time now
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0070298_0070429	let's just make it a two then
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0083501_0083683	it's gonna be one of that in my report anyway
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0123549_0123800	think it's a little off the point of view
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0202407_0202851	we're a little bit over budget on the l. c. d. display so we need some more money for that
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0207514_0207752	do you take that into consideration
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0138315_0138673	now it's only six and a half euros
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0164377_0164535	and that would be fine yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0083208_0083491	that's that's also just a little hard to print
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0033289_0033662	oh no it would have to be in the back of your head for example
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0113201_0113484	so we're still on a budget of course
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0160463_0160841	the one thing is that i think the l. c. d. was pretty impressive
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0158071_0158261	so you're not missing out too much on that
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0176696_0176832	yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0208156_0208471	like black and white or something like that
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0193972_0194451	yeah i don't think the l. c. d. screen doesn't count
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0117520_0117628	so that would be a two
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0093280_0093454	yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0201817_0202407	because if you make the l. c. d. screen as small as possible and the rest of the remote control is in a normal size
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0025911_0026127	oh here's my slide show again
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0097680_0098250	because i think it's a little bit more difficult to make rubber than we already did
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0053913_0054337	we take out the l. c. d. display because that's a little more expensive i guess
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0066839_0066952	yeah yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0221346_0221542	yeah that's the yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0078492_0079300	the final report is supposed to be sent back to the user after a certain period of time in order to activate the speech recognition feature
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0070123_0070298	the first round is the working design
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0105433_0105566	okay thank you
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0213692_0214036	are we gonna sell it at twelve and a half euros
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0080695_0080800	but for the plastic
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0028157_0028476	you can have it as long as the material is rubber
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0027429_0027532	oh
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0003664_0003952	we aim to make a design that is trendy and user centred
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0162501_0162618	that's what i thought about too
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0009137_0009262	is that from the p
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0045226_0045415	it's it's quite a bit more expensive than what we want
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0026214_0026708	or something
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0210588_0211064	yeah i don't think you missed out a few yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0144689_0144939	it's not in the budget twelve and a half euros
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0026955_0027532	it's just too small to have a whole l. c. d. screen or something
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0033420_0033651	yeah on the front side that you draw on the front
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0153005_0153128	yeah we could yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0157721_0157907	now it's twenty five euros
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0163055_0163217	okay
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0137174_0137358	but i think the l. c. d. screen would be cool
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0141279_0141927	and then the back would be made of titanium which would be fine
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0139752_0139857	uh we'll have no
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0190085_0190483	everybody's busy with their own thing so there's not really a lot of discussion going on
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0183706_0184183	and if we had made a more spongy design
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0209312_0209994	so it looks like it's going to fall over a lot but if you look at the shape it's still pretty cool in its own way
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0139938_0140207	okay now you have to take out the curve and the l. c. d.
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0198494_0199206	maybe you could put it in the l. c. d. display because it's basically your product information
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0083007_0083114	because of the double r. c.
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0102561_0102690	yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0171714_0172027	it's not like it takes a lot of power to keep it running
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0166692_0166948	we haven't done fruit and vegetables before
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0121644_0122034	um we've got plastic and rubber in it
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0181444_0181597	yeah that was not cool though
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0098073_0098582	so how do you feel about this
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0168915_0169188	um did you feel like a team
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0138224_0138383	but it's still a little bit dark
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0010200_0010830	so do you have the l. c. d. screen on your on your unit
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0096383_0096845	and you didn't read it in the in the email that you got from us and you didn't read it in the newsflash that you heard on the way to work
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0027464_0027593	that could be a good title too
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0014453_0015093	and we'll look at the financial aspect of uh what we came up with
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0159145_0159456	one euro per unit i guess
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0010605_0010822	yeah so
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0069892_0070123	oh sorry i got it wrong
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0210623_0210881	but i think that's but you're right
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0027532_0028157	yeah okay that that would be nice if you could make it a little bit bigger than that one
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0157223_0157350	yeah with the colours of course
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0163418_0163680	we don't need to stay out of this much time
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0124069_0124247	what if you make it a pink one for example
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0119933_0120168	just put a black one on top of it for the logo
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0120548_0120704	yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0138626_0139126	so it's just making it a little bit more complicated because we're going to incorporate the l. c. d. screen into the design
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0143373_0143511	and go back to the drawing board
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0151710_0152186	if we're if we're working with this product which is going to be sold at a price of twelve and a half
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0086708_0087178	did we make a simple design or did we make something that looks more fancy than what you had in mind
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0083938_0084046	yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0021771_0022666	and the l. c. d. screen which we decided on um at the end of the last meeting actually worked out quite well
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0118949_0119083	oh no
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0106722_0107058	okay let's see if you can put this on the l. c. d. screen
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0116133_0116678	yeah you just put the name of the fruit on it and it's it's a spongy feel
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0068777_0068895	okay
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0172027_0172218	it's more of a double curved case though huh
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0185103_0185350	um the look and feel pretty much
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0180250_0180551	but now it's the time to talk about that anyway
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0023993_0024362	um we decided that the l. c. d. display we wanted
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0092947_0093561	we took out the l. c. d. display because we didn't have enough space in our budget to build a l. c. d. display into the remote control
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0213994_0214279	is it is this a hand shaped remote control
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0033648_0034164	so even if it's a little bit on the on the expensive side then we go with yellow
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0119481_0119693	but it's still a little bit flat on the bottom side
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0170117_0170307	find out more about it yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0213317_0213646	maybe it has to sit on the top
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0185416_0185717	yeah doing a little bit more in the end right
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0221151_0221379	but we need to decide on some more later on
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0116802_0117113	it's the name of the uh the top number yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0049116_0049991	to create a new remote control with a fancy look and feel it should be easy to learn for the user interface part
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0120464_0120574	two and a half dollars
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0142112_0142400	okay so the l. c. d. is how we handle the speech recognition
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0090814_0090958	okay fine
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0192020_0192299	and so as as you can see
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0181283_0181419	it's a fake l. c. d.
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0114834_0115187	it was a red apple in a green box
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0210559_0210707	maybe it's a five minute problem
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0004997_0005194	we want to stick to a simple design
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0128938_0129220	and we don't stick to one standard anyway
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0041343_0041510	thank you very much
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0169703_0169821	yeah i think we had a nice design
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0081046_0082045	but the l. c. d. screen is just a fancy way of saying you could have uh normal buttons for channel selection and volume control
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0204806_0205290	and you can't get out of that by just talking about your favourite animal and not talking about your favourite colour
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0138203_0138312	oh yes
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0042881_0043105	you go there
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0089572_0089900	it's just basic colour black and yellow
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0059099_0059204	and ready
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0024362_0024997	and they said it was a good idea to have the l. c. d. screen on top of the remote control
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0139863_0140057	oh it's not cost effective
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0205778_0205904	that's my name
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0195953_0196277	the triple r. c. the triple r. c. d. gives you a lot of profit
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0146444_0146567	where is the voice recognition
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0142988_0143645	if we make a basic remote control with the l. c. d. display and without the speech recognition module that's just what we talked about
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0177869_0178399	but you didn't say anything about it when you made it that it's not something we lost
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0173464_0173955	yeah yeah i don't know if it's really a one or a two
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0009949_0010093	yeah sure let's see
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0194929_0195222	we can't do that with the one dollar left over
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0090559_0090965	yeah i'd give it a yeah i'd give it a score of four
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0055241_0055377	so we're going to lose the curve
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0091194_0091503	four and a half okay
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0068080_0068370	would give that a three i guess
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0101757_0101958	maybe we have to drop more of the features
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0057436_0057767	to give it the l. c. d. menu and the speech recognition
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0201118_0201302	everything's a little bit lost i think
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0152186_0152756	if we come up with a remote control for the l. c. d. screen then we can put the speech recognition in it
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0182059_0182550	how are we going to implement the l. c. d. display and the speech recognition feature
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0165733_0165921	so that's alright then
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0158747_0158964	are people really going to talk about it
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0191831_0191944	absolutely yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0149976_0150154	yeah
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0156026_0156347	it's some kind of information you can't display on the l. c. d.
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0204421_0204579	but for example in the top it's okay
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0144939_0145209	but some kind of speech recognition that we could think of
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0056716_0056932	alright
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0098582_0099508	so we have the basic idea that we're going to make a remote control that's very easy to use with the latest technology
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0215890_0216450	so basically i'm going to describe a little bit more about the l. c. d. display
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0067192_0067463	two and a half euros sorry people
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0061753_0062147	okay the final product is a clear yellow
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0181597_0182055	and what's the market demand um twelve and a half euros
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0127840_0128124	okay we'll just pick it up and put it in the l. c. d.
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0086309_0086708	we've talked about the use of a push button which is pretty much the same thing you use every day
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0041653_0041912	okay opening at the back
AMI_ES2004d_H00_MEO015_0199681_0200613	like you said a lot of people are talking about speech recognition in a remote control but it's more like a marketing thing than a functional thing
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0219181_0219500	after five minutes i think the meeting's over again
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0113995_0114217	um it must be original in its design
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0095602_0096244	yeah i think it should be a little bit of a special colour to put on the remote control
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0156794_0157060	it'll do then
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0158628_0158747	oh
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0062147_0062660	how do you feel about the look and feel of a fruit and vegetable inspired remote control
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0196984_0197713	if you make a final product and if you sell it to a lot of different people that might be an interesting idea
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0120288_0120438	so just one double r. c.
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0206460_0206619	here we go again
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0101119_0101757	after this meeting we'll go back to the design phase and see if we've developed a product that fits the budget of twelve and a half euros
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0143648_0144016	yeah the menu button should it should stay there
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0032552_0032972	we don't have the l. c. d. screen on it i think
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0141065_0141279	it could be a double r. c.
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0091965_0092202	so that's a four point two
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0127484_0127676	so we don't have to count on it for the l. c. d. screen
AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0040004_0040229	oh not not yet
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0158669_0158815	twenty five no
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0002393_0002526	and pretty trendy i think
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0121063_0121404	but the scroll wheels and all the stuff like that it's not expensive in the end
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0211119_0211269	we don't really have to think about that though
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0065609_0066132	we've got twelve and a half euros which is about twelve fifty for the selling price
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0052504_0052880	okay so we can drop the l. c. d. screen if we want to save money
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0077443_0077562	okay
AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0105464_0105590	oh
AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0166203_0166372	okay
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0059086_0059303	maybe it's a little bit of a banana
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0053853_0054232	okay that should filter out a lot
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0058148_0058588	yeah maybe we could have it like this in the shape of a banana or something like that
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0040381_0041267	so this is basically what you have to do all the time on a remote control to keep it under twelve and a half euros
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0011307_0011817	so we don't really have to decide on the place where we want to put the l. c. d. screen
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0050378_0050675	well maybe we're gonna do this anyway because it's a good idea
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0016519_0016699	so maybe you have to make another note on that
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0025468_0025736	okay
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0029006_0029219	so we can write that it's okay
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0074525_0074986	we have to make sure that this product is delivered as fast as possible in the market
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0011875_0011991	um
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0024394_0024545	oh i can't make this right
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0030798_0031573	it's a very good product
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0032258_0032750	so if you had like that it would have been a little bit more easy to use
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0026002_0026470	triple r. c. triple r. c. means that the entire remote control turns out to be a triple r.
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0048137_0048262	oh
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0065819_0066177	and it shouldn't be too big because you could lose it somewhere in your living room
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0041916_0042758	okay um does anyone have any new ideas for the design of the remote control itself
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0034707_0034831	it's not
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0027758_0027986	what you were thinking about earlier
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0057264_0057676	so a l a little bit of rubber could be nice
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0060957_0061646	if you make it in black or in yellow or something like that then it's not an original design
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0019744_0020164	so here is the final report which is supposed to be here
AMI_IS1009a_H01_FIO087_0052326_0052544	all the all the remote controls are spongy
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0035592_0035998	okay
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0052783_0053265	yeah m yeah a little more expensive than the normal chip
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0066398_0066528	yeah that doesn't have oh
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0077780_0078716	okay but i think you should keep in mind that this is basically what people are gonna expect from a l. c. d. display
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0037725_0038609	um the final product is a remote control in the market price of twelve and a half euros
AMI_IS1009a_H01_FIO087_0006739_0006909	yeah menu is your favourite
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0019638_0019744	alright
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0071171_0071568	uh marketing expert is uh designing it's looking for trends and yeah
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0057201_0057472	yeah something like that on the l. c. d. screen
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0079650_0079774	oh alright well
AMI_IS1009a_H01_FIO087_0047276_0047914	it could be used for uh like uh a menu uh or something like that where you use the l. c. d. display
AMI_IS1009a_H01_FIO087_0033158_0033336	okay no
AMI_IS1009a_H01_FIO087_0052105_0052326	yeah d yeah it should be designed for this indeed
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0079125_0079260	yeah he has an email
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0067777_0067999	yeah maybe you'll have to work on it now
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0031573_0031812	and it's like that to say
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0075610_0075784	think that's the only side of it
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0066770_0067159	oh well but then we don't have any colours anyway
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0079163_0079283	how about you produce
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0063003_0063476	if it's a black and white l. c. d. screen then that would be a nice selling point
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0075138_0075610	and um yeah you could put speech recognition in that for example
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0056602_0056712	so it's a m
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0044399_0044923	things like this which you could easily find in your l. c. d. menu or something like that
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0028008_0028551	have to make a real remote control anyway so i'm pretty happy with it
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0027623_0027852	okay i'll see what i can do
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0033357_0033549	oh don't do that again please
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0071725_0071875	the final design yeah
AMI_IS1009a_H01_FIO087_0046146_0046571	yeah i think the l. c. d. must be very clear for all of us
AMI_IS1009a_H01_FIO087_0053067_0053246	the l. c. d. screen
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0072439_0073430	and the main functions are switching channels and um making a selection which is basically what we discussed in the last meeting
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0021157_0021820	which will give us the design specifications and some additional information on the double curved case
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0028810_0029082	and you have to press it more than five seconds
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0064224_0065078	yeah but i think you know that it's not possible to make a scroll wheel with an l. c. d. screen on it
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0035999_0036482	okay let's get back to the high tech part of the design
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0032877_0033282	okay that's a problem i had to deal with
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0025279_0025469	we'll have to get started on the functional design
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0040286_0040648	and it's a five
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0015754_0016232	uh energy source should be a rechargeable power supply
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0067808_0068395	yeah okay but we have to make sure that we don't lose too much time because we have a lot of stuff going on
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0065078_0065848	and uh i don't know if you all saw the last email but there's a lot of new stuff on the company website
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0073594_0073824	and of course price
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0060567_0060957	okay well i mean it may be the middle of the r. c. but it's alright
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0012611_0013238	well i think the l. c. d. is a good idea because it's uh we're talking to the younger audience
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0051311_0051812	it shouldn't it shouldn't be something that you have to do just with speech recognition
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0049278_0049524	yeah
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0072011_0072439	so you have a functional design and then we have a trend watching
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0013804_0014097	push buttons that are pretty standard in the market haven't they
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0055123_0055827	yeah but they don't like that because it's a part of the product and you have to pay for that
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0070746_0071113	so we're looking for a balance between what we came up with
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0042869_0043119	yeah because of the remote control itself
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0053345_0053873	yeah so like you said um yeah some kind of light in your remote control
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0008533_0008694	well i have to find out a little more on that
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0054232_0055025	because i think it's one of the things that people like is that if you have a little bit of innovation in the in the look and feel
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0011071_0011307	okay i'm the project manager today
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0027468_0027612	you wanna go in a little
AMI_IS1009a_H01_FIO087_0035586_0035895	that doesn't look like a cat
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0062575_0063003	in a in a sense that it's made out of rubber and that it's spongy
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0066689_0066793	because people are like this
AMI_IS1009a_H01_FIO087_0007661_0008083	and my role is to uh make a detailed design of the remote control
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0069545_0070163	okay uh this is the agenda for the first uh the working design
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0079652_0079781	let's see
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0063909_0064125	so the last slide should take up the extra space
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0032052_0032258	and you find your right side
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0039523_0039851	can i get that channel again through the l. c. d. screen
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0066522_0066689	well you guys are supposed to be busy
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0069212_0069545	okay well you'll get the same email as us
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0048170_0048273	oh maybe you'll eat it
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0070163_0070398	that's your industrial designer
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0023611_0023838	supplemental
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0010851_0011071	and as you may already know it's a banana
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0057471_0057593	so if it's lost
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0048672_0049526	so that you could have a more complex uh remote control with all the l. c. d. and stuff like that
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0053809_0053924	yeah
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0026470_0026872	why does everybody want to go to the l. c. d. screen
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0005586_0005769	everybody ready
AMI_IS1009a_H01_FIO087_0057858_0058016	for the l. c. d. screen
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0043656_0044399	because you don't really have a lot of new things in the menu if you have like just one or two menus like we had here
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0073430_0073594	that would be your idea
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0077087_0077357	um any questions about this
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0021944_0022212	basically a simple design i think
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0080194_0080361	and we can see what comes up
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0066611_0066715	because it
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0066866_0067777	maybe you could look into it because it's a little bit of an issue with the one we came up with but we'll come back to it in a minute
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0049614_0050276	um it's a total of twelve point five
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0055827_0056564	and and the rest of the time you're watching the t. v. so it's a little bit more handy to have the menu on the on the screen
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0073824_0074169	that that that that's a pretty good idea in the end
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0020378_0021157	that's what we have to keep in mind when we're designing the remote control that it's gonna be a little bit different
AMI_IS1009a_H01_FIO087_0046571_0046979	yeah that's why they got these yellow and black buttons here
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0051812_0052107	okay so there is nothing more to the idea of the voice recognition
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0063476_0063721	that means we can do that later in the design
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0068849_0069212	or do you think you get off the l. c. d. screen anyway
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0057674_0058145	if we lose the l. c. d. spongy material
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0022046_0022155	okay so
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0022276_0022645	we're designing a product that's gonna be different from everything else
AMI_IS1009a_H01_FIO087_0033747_0033963	but you could
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0071572_0072011	so the technical function and the functional design and you're talking about the same thing
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0024948_0025270	oh yeah
AMI_IS1009a_H01_FIO087_0006909_0007661	and i mean uh the l. c. d. is uh a new feature and it's more expensive than the l. c. d. menu
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0079796_0080194	then we uh see you at the next meeting
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0061646_0062032	but it's hard to play around with when the buttons are on top
AMI_IS1009a_H01_FIO087_0080408_0080526	okay
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0036725_0037272	okay this is what we have decided for the first phase which is a little bit of planning i suppose
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0008339_0008533	and i'm a marketing expert
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0068207_0068311	yeah a good point
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0052422_0052829	so maybe you should like try to make it in a nice triangle or something like that
AMI_IS1009a_H01_FIO087_0047914_0048673	like in the case of the remote control here changing channels or volume or teletext or something
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0038740_0039364	and not too expensive for the l. c. d. display and speech recognition
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0042895_0043324	well we use an l. c. d. display anyway
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0006200_0006547	and um what's your name and function in this project
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0037272_0037593	um seventy five percent of the time are willing to spend
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0029219_0029775	um okay um double r. c. triple r. c.
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0074169_0074465	but maybe that's the end of the project
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0077357_0077595	or speech uh recognition
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0058790_0059260	so it's just a little bit more expensive than the regular one or something like that
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0052829_0053345	maybe you can draw your favourite animal or something
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0014944_0015168	yeah this should be here i think
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0024101_0024250	yeah
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0050780_0051357	so i think we have to make sure that it's not too expensive because we're trying to stay within our budget
AMI_IS1009a_H01_FIO087_0046979_0047276	and um it must have a spongy feel
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0058567_0058790	exactly i mean that's exactly what we said
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0024812_0025104	maybe we should read it again
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0006154_0006257	yeah that's a good point
AMI_IS1009a_H01_FIO087_0032223_0032416	yes i'm just like you
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0055567_0055672	yeah
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0006547_0006729	so maybe we should make it a little
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0012134_0012611	okay well the trend is young and spongy
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0030752_0031064	okay that's a fact
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0045986_0046137	yeah
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0005769_0006085	uh i think we are the first ones to do this sort of thing
AMI_IS1009a_H03_FIO089_0078758_0079163	okay i think i have to make something out of it tonight
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0079260_0079395	yeah i mean yeah i think
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0070461_0070773	yeah it's fancy in the advanced chip yeah
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0015168_0015754	uh there's a menu uh thing on our remote control right here
AMI_IS1009a_H01_FIO087_0034799_0034978	okay i'm going to stick with that
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0014097_0014616	um i don't think we can get anything extra out of this
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0068584_0068849	okay the next meeting will be in thirty minutes
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0062032_0062575	it's like that but you make it a lot more expensive than the l. c. d.
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0043324_0043499	and um
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0026872_0027252	so in that case we need to make the speech recognition part of it
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0056614_0057317	or if it's a little bit of yellow or red or something that you see on the on the remote control
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0013287_0013804	um we agreed that it should take up space and get in the way of easy operation
AMI_IS1009a_H02_FIO084_0063430_0063763	yeah yeah probably a little bit too expensive
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0046515_0046621	alright small
AMI_IS1009a_H00_FIE088_0076472_0077087	so well we have a time of two and a half minute to say hi
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0111519_0111649	roo roo remote control
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0137802_0138030	yeah that's a lot of an extra colour on the back
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0097752_0098520	and it's a little bit funny 'cause you don't find the menu button in the menu
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0173347_0173463	represents
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0026131_0026563	so how are you gonna come up with a name for your remote control if you can't see it
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0060994_0061373	good morning to the team working on the design of the remote control
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0098176_0098450	yeah you don't yeah you don't yeah
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0030625_0031175	so i think we should lose the l. c. d. screen and just take out the speech recognition component
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0186120_0186575	and that we could also implement plastic in it and make it a different colour
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0081515_0081690	and there should be a clear line
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0010963_0011958	okay well i think we're pretty much on the same page here as far as uh as far as the remote control is supposed to look and function
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0155734_0156064	so let's see what the costs are to do with these two things
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0121442_0122422	and what i found was that the l. c. d. display should be used for a higher level of design which is uh to increase the price
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0147988_0148961	if if a person wants to pay extra for speech recognition then he would have to pay an extra price which is ten and a half cents on top of the eleven and a half cents
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0060245_0060521	the p the cover's okay
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0076111_0076315	can you go to the next slide please
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0112286_0112464	oh let's make a simple chip
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0155070_0155734	oh and what kind of functions did he want in his design
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0110652_0111183	you should give it a name so that people don't get confused with the device itself
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0143608_0144513	so which means that you have the traditional design which is used in most t. v. s but with a little different colours and different designs for the for the menus
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0055696_0055895	okay that's about it for me uh right now
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0009559_0009705	for your presentation
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0165367_0166225	that's uh definitely a good idea because all the trends have been implemented in this one
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0087557_0088267	so maybe you have some basic information on the different types of speech recognition systems that are out there
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0038308_0038440	okay so that's something
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0157798_0158314	yeah and i don't think people have to do a lot of research on their own anyway
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0170623_0170867	or do we take out one curve left
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0085488_0085806	yeah and colours are also yeah different colours
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0185216_0185658	well we took out the l. c. d. menu to make room for the speech recognition
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0197756_0197905	finish meeting now
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0022406_0022828	so it's a good idea to make it a little bit bigger and to drop the rubber too
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0107578_0107880	when we have the l. c. d. menu button it's a little bit more complicated
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0120107_0120208	yes
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0185947_0186082	the pen is lost
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0096845_0096954	oh no
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0121071_0121245	would you fill it a one or a two
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0040704_0041353	so i think we need to just take out one of the curves here and one of the curves there or something like that
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0109143_0109521	which is a little bit of a compromise between the l. c. d. and the speech recognition
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0127901_0128111	on the on the remote
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0105851_0106265	uh then the remote control should have a long shelf life
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0019778_0020047	so i mean that was what they told me
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0160519_0160975	so that's uh one of the interesting things i came up with
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0020047_0020887	and i think there's a lot more emphasis on the l. c. d. screen than on the l. c. d. display anyway because it's something that is new to the market
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0066643_0067027	uh is a remote control a simple design or a decorative design
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0154275_0155070	how are we going to achieve this with the price of twelve and a half euro and a half
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0089635_0089884	yeah the channel selection
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0026563_0027101	and maybe you take it with you to the next meeting and tell us what you came up with
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0014672_0015069	yeah you can see it on your own remote control so you don't have to write anything down
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0085700_0085982	that that you said that they want to spend money on that
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0083182_0084080	but maybe it's uh yeah it's a little bit more expensive if you have to make the l. c. d. screen for example
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0103559_0103774	yeah that's good that's good for the curve
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0040221_0040704	and that might be something that could be lost in the speech recognition anyway
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0104880_0105030	and the buttons
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0089813_0089969	like a double r.
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0052895_0053566	so i got an email saying that you had to start working on the project and i'm supposed to finish it by the end of the day
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0007539_0007703	okay you don't remember what we said
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0106384_0106796	so if you take it in your hand like this then it's a little bit easier to uh
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0149547_0149771	and then you can use the l. c. d. yeah
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0114975_0115139	oh
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0086928_0087468	maybe it's a good idea to look at the buttons and what they're gonna be on the front because that's the most important thing
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0097647_0097780	yeah yeah
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0109521_0110074	and which colour is the l. c. d. screen yellow or white or something like that
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0007998_0008644	um let's see what you could have put a little bit more into the design if we had just lost the l. c. d. screen
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0029054_0029206	okay we can leave the logo out then
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0085300_0085700	yeah that's a good feedback from the market that the look and feel is important
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0187816_0188477	so maybe you can have a little more space for your name or something like that on the side of the remote control
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0179728_0179872	doesn't doesn't matter
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0047965_0048737	okay so we're pretty much in agreement on the remote control itself as far as i understand
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0162455_0163223	um that's not really an issue because if we can make a new remote control then that's fine
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0027570_0027685	the sell price
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0111613_0111738	hello roo
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0081211_0081515	so that they can take it to their own home
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0086437_0086748	yeah just make it a little bit bigger in the middle
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0044093_0044900	and that's pretty much the same thing as we found out in the last meeting which was that fruit and vegetables are definitely more important
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0057335_0057454	yeah yeah sure
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0103757_0103939	okay
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0169322_0170178	okay you mean like for example if you make a yellow remote control you know it's not very nice
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0156064_0156654	so the whole thing is pretty much uh a little bit of research on how to make it
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0179295_0179446	oh it doesn't it doesn't cost extra
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0148961_0149228	so let's keep that in mind and use it as needed
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0197287_0197556	that's why i made the l. c. d. display in the first place
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0096316_0096672	because we have no more than twelve and a half euros
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0139914_0140886	and um the second thing that should be in a remote control is that there should be a nice uh design for the for the shape of the remote itself
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0102808_0103154	yeah maybe you already saw them or they're not there yet
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0088504_0088682	that might make the cost a little higher
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0201207_0201447	so now i say it's under twelve and a half
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0102753_0103119	yeah you can yeah you can store them in a menu or something
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0061832_0062592	if you make a remote control in the shape of a banana it's a little bit more trendy than the regular remote control
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0176300_0177029	but in a normal t. v. remote control there would be a big difference between a basic model and a fancy model
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0053566_0053911	instead of a traditional battery power supply an l. c. d. display
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0198668_0198931	yeah maybe it yeah
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0120040_0120160	you are not
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0085982_0086172	so the shape is uh
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0145632_0146151	and this can be used for a menu which is possible if there is a l. c. d. display
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0104056_0104880	uh the menu button uh can be linked to the l. c. d. menu which is not uh shown here but it can be found
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0013030_0013619	um i figured that the l. c. d. screen would be more expensive than the speech recognition
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0034686_0035355	um we have decided not to spend extra time and resources on something that is hard to find
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0096935_0097875	and you don't have to spend a lot of money on it because it's not very expensive in the first place and they're selling them at twenty five euros and not at thirty
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0084080_0084245	yeah
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0050250_0050983	okay now you know that it's gonna be a bit more expensive to make this in the first place because we're not going to buy rubber
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0061373_0061644	okay um can you lose the l. c. d. screen
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0157482_0157685	yeah
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0159520_0160519	we have a little more information about the functional design which has been handled by you in the last meeting
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0090440_0091106	and uh maybe there's a button on the remote control that you can use to find out which channel you're on or something like that
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0173074_0173490	of course the output we talked about earlier
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0083710_0083926	well we all agree on that i believe
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0177578_0177728	yeah we could do that of course
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0168847_0169322	and i think the curves should be just like the curves on the t. v.
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0043738_0044093	it's too little time to have to learn how to make a remote control
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0137124_0137523	and i still don't have to make a complete list of all the things i can talk about
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0198892_0199452	but i think it's better to take out the l. c. d. screen and the speech recognition
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0018921_0019778	and the second thing is that um the remote control has to do something for the younger people too
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0091748_0092561	so uh i think we need to take a look at um in terms of design and uh if we want to make it more like an l. c. d. screen
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0137642_0137890	if they can look at that then it's a little problem
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0153384_0154275	okay well the l. c. d. display is a little bit more expensive but we already have all the buttons that we need on the on the remote control
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0009682_0009830	apparently i'm a poor person
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0039112_0039508	and that the cover is printed on the rubber double curved case
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0070147_0070757	and that should change the colour and the shape of the t. r. i think to make it a little different
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0173587_0173696	okay
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0034130_0034686	okay um can i add an extra page or something
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0038285_0039112	um and the third thing that they are more interested in is um the the kind of material they want
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0003732_0003865	okay everybody is ready
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0059376_0059594	oh can you make it a flat shape then
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0111068_0111184	to make it rubber
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0042838_0043738	okay but i'm not sure if there's a lot of information on the market about um the remote controls that are out there in the world at the moment
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0044900_0045388	um so those are two things that we decided upon anyway
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0088300_0088570	yeah that's yeah that's an idea that i uh
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0163447_0163714	so there's just this one of these options i have
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0141528_0142412	and uh i didn't find any new information for the user interface design which should be uh sent to me
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0122422_0122697	okay then i can give you the l. c. d. presentation
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0194615_0194841	well i think we can all agree on that
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0089733_0089875	like an animal or a
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0021364_0021801	we want to make a product which is original trendy and user friendly in the same time
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0071650_0072292	okay that was the end of our last meeting so we have a little bit more information
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0199939_0200079	yeah
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0158170_0158348	yeah can't lose the t. yeah
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0190507_0190650	you know yes
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0157093_0157263	even if it's making noise again
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0157448_0157621	everybody has a t. v. or what
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0103710_0103811	yeah
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0180380_0181272	and i think it's the whole point of having a remote control is that you can find it anywhere in the house pretty quickly
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0114021_0114147	it's not from the menu
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0017633_0018011	it's just too expensive to do we take out the l. c. d. display
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0103293_0103559	you have to make sure you don't go on the wrong side and lose one of your buttons
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0102313_0102440	yeah the colours
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0049802_0050107	let's see if you can get some more information on it
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0106796_0107456	you don't need to make a remote control for the whole world but you make a remote control for your t. v.
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0130658_0131316	then the channel selection can be placed in the left top corner and the volume selection can be placed in the right top corner
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0041353_0041995	so here we have this information on the l. c. d. display which is supposed to be in our design
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0158314_0158496	but there are not enough features in it
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0098520_0099118	maybe it's better to have some more space for the l. c. d. screen
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0140886_0141138	yeah he he he he should not be in here
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0182431_0183428	but let's say for example that we make a remote control which has the l. c. d. screen and the speech recognition and the push buttons
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0186847_0187426	yeah but maybe there's a new feature on the remote control that you don't know yet
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0073653_0073867	so you can uh draw it on whatever you want
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0102692_0102808	yes
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0054921_0055696	and maybe we can make a little extra information on the front of the remote control and tell people that it's fun to learn
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0186661_0186947	oh no i don't think that's a big deal
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0095879_0096045	yeah it's like uh you know
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0041995_0042510	but maybe the the thing that could be implemented is a little menu uh thing
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0196111_0197066	um basically there are a lot of different ways of making a remote control but um not all of them are long lasting
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0045388_0046099	um we want to make it as easy as possible for the user to use our remote control
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0179221_0179323	exactly double r. c.
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0057229_0057449	you don't get your email straight away
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0134353_0134816	and uh one of the one of the new ideas i found was uh
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0201778_0201922	so that's what we'll do
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0160975_0161845	well maybe we can just have a little discussion on the on the new project requirements and then come to a decision
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0052603_0052895	if you don't find it important i can just leave it out completely
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0132383_0133347	uh the remote control should have a fancy look and feel but it should not compromise the functionality of the remote control which is in this case the l. c. d. display
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0117636_0117926	uh there's no indication that it's a curve either
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0181272_0182218	one of the most important things is that it has to be original because we only have twelve and a half euros left
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0137830_0138232	yes but the l. c. d. can be uh as an option
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0157657_0157792	teletext video and d. v. d.
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0100076_0100251	but we'll get to that in a bit
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0088531_0089146	well i think that we should be able to put that into the budget because that will be a little bit of an extra thing
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0020887_0021322	because i think this is going to be a problem if we lose the l. c. d. screen anyway
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0185658_0186120	okay um the l. c. d. display is a bit more expensive than the sample sensor i guess
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0147193_0147988	and uh let's say that a lot of money should be spent on the speech recognition and stuff like that
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0198506_0198918	okay but we have to make this one more durable than all the other remotes out there
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0051832_0052603	because as far as we have more money than is feasible to build a remote control with l. c. d. display
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0010629_0010753	oh okay
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0197944_0198241	um yeah
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0121146_0121371	yes yes
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0071692_0072250	yeah but so we ha yeah
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0179808_0179911	yeah i think i should do that
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0060771_0060994	yeah okay that's true
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0059841_0060125	oh yeah it's not like you have to pick it up here
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0102143_0102905	yeah that's a good one because if you're watching the game and you wanna watch that channel that's not gonna be a problem
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0166276_0166737	well you know the l. c. d. is just a small part of the remote control
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0056599_0057157	that would be a new curve i guess
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0105030_0105851	maybe we can have a little bit of uh an overview on what the l. c. d. screen is and how it can be used in a in a remote control
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0185553_0185747	yeah that's that's well the curve
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0018011_0018921	because then we don't even have to think of a way to build in the speech recognition feature because it's just one thing that people are going to be willing to pay extra for
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0200145_0200247	are we gonna be able to
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0179132_0179323	that's not really gonna make it that much cheaper
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0115370_0116172	how to get how to get the latest news about what's happening in the world of electronics and what people are looking for
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0176298_0176399	well that's that's
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0167876_0168847	um i think that's a little bit of a lot of the information that we got from the last meeting has to be taken into account in the next one
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0032924_0033501	we took out the l. c. d. display that would make it a little bit more expensive to put the l. c. d. back in the budget
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0047160_0047734	and i think that's definitely worth the extra effort to do something like that with our remote control
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0200825_0200991	yeah yeah
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0158673_0159520	but i think it's a good idea to take out the speech recognition part because we're not targeting young people anyway
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0177029_0177625	and uh one could just use the blue one but they would like to buy this one which is new
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0036262_0037062	and the colour of the of the entire remote control should be in yellow
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0119741_0119918	and finance
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0091392_0091748	if you have lost your remote control then you have to find a replacement
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0179020_0179123	the the whole thing
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0107456_0107578	maybe we can have that
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0126978_0127965	so maybe you could take a look at the new product requirements and see if there are any new trends in speech recognition or uh personalisation of the remote control
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0108668_0109143	and a basic battery and a power adapter would be a good start
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0149375_0149515	time is running here
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0086009_0086577	oh no you can't do it like that but if you want to make it a little bit more uh yeah
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0058082_0058319	and you are number two
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0012069_0012334	that's that's what we discussed earlier
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0049169_0049802	okay but then you still have to buy one because they're all black or something like that
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0094930_0095705	because i think it's more important when we're losing one of our things to lose the whole thing because people are willing to spend their money on what they want
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0176666_0176809	banana is a good idea
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0050107_0050250	they're gonna buy it anyway next time
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0149124_0149678	okay it's a little bit like the l. c. d. screen then you take out the menu
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0121036_0121146	you can make it flat
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0095705_0096316	we're all the same team uh working on the same project and you know each one of you has your own tasks for this meeting
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0070757_0071600	so i'm going to have a little discussion on the technical design and uh how the remote control is supposed to function
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0033501_0034381	maybe we can make a little more of an l. c. d. screen or something like that on top of the actual remote control
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0112017_0112192	yeah okay on the menu button
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0099118_0100076	so that you can uh yeah take a look at the latest trends and find out what's popular in the current market and then use that for your design
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0089884_0090028	yeah that's yeah
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0021801_0022222	we just have to see what it's gonna do and i don't think it's too bad
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0169762_0169980	you can make a banana on the back
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0103084_0103293	yeah a lot of the time on top of a scroll wheel
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0184362_0185216	maybe we can find out what is more important and then we can decide on a one or a two anyway
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0003972_0004279	yeah i'm just gonna put it here and you'll have to make a report on it
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0089549_0089661	just fill in the colours
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0150288_0150602	okay i have
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0139184_0139773	so if you need to change the channel or the volume and it's not on the l. c. d. display
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0117284_0117607	let's see what you got back on the l. c. d. screen
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0022222_0022406	and take it back to your own room
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0099002_0099208	yeah these are special colours
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0037439_0037582	yeah okay
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0092561_0093299	if you want to make it like the one in the picture then you have to change the colour of the pen and the line width or something like that
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0066293_0066601	so like a an idea of a triangle or something like that
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0202220_0202324	so thank you very much
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0183533_0184353	so that's a bit of a problem because the l. c. d. display is really taking up a lot of space in the in the budget
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0200474_0201028	we'll be able to do that in a little bit more time than if we wanted to go to the l. c. d. display
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0093299_0093901	so if you can imagine that it has to look like the one we have now but with more colours on it i think
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0108020_0108277	and then the front is black and
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0058247_0058379	two and a half
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0138232_0139184	the l. c. d. can be used to display the channel numbers and we can also use it for the beep function
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0161845_0162455	okay and uh i don't know what we should do to make those numbers
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0054476_0054921	let's just have to make sure there's not too many buttons on it anyway
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0031175_0031708	we should also take this into consideration like the l. c. d. display if it's possible
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0201029_0201159	okay for now
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0190462_0191133	yeah like uh we have like a normal design for the basic colours and then you can have different kind of designs
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0197828_0197944	finish meeting now
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0047734_0047873	okay we can go to the next slide
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0190982_0191694	but if there's a lot of space in the in the l. c. d. display then it's not really an issue but if there's a lot of space in the in the menu
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0111410_0111519	uh curve here
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0116205_0116375	so maybe we have to look at it a little bit further
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0179406_0179688	yeah that that that won't that won't cost much
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0137491_0137642	yeah
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0010847_0010963	yeah there we go
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0186575_0186754	um is there enough room for an l. c. d.
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0053911_0054476	so let's see if there's enough money left in the budget to have a little bit of extra stuff on top of that anyway
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0039508_0040221	so that if the l. c. d. display is an option then that could be easily added to the price
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0133347_0134209	and uh my personal preference is that it should be a more advanced uh aspect of the of the remote control itself
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0170178_0170467	but the real reaction is quite clear about what they want
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0190040_0190371	and if people really don't want to pay for speech recognition then
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0110167_0110652	and uh oh can we also keep the l. c. d. screen which is a good idea
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0115161_0115274	oh you don't have to
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0179785_0180380	well the curve is just to increase the price of the whole thing so that it's not the cheapest option
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0048737_0049169	that's the same thing that people are looking for in a in a remote control
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0198931_0199144	maybe we should do something with our l. c. d. screen
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0179007_0179132	what about the location
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0108277_0108576	um let's um this is what it can do
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0086683_0086926	it's just it's just make it a special one
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0102284_0102486	oh no
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0006079_0006733	okay the third meeting i think is more important than the second meeting actually
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0056303_0056460	and uh
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0035355_0036262	um the second thing is that we want to make it a little bit more fancy than the one that's out there in the market
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0100079_0100646	yeah that's true but there should be a l. c. d. screen anyway because they are pretty expensive
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0128951_0129389	and at the end of the day it will take up a lot of space and the price will be very high
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0131316_0132153	and the other one is uh the the key feature of the remote control is that it should have a uh voice uh recognition
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0091106_0091392	but if there are more colours in it then it will be more expensive
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0010096_0010373	okay and now i can uh select a file
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0083585_0084194	yeah well that's that's not a problem in the in the l. c. d. menu that we have to implement anyway
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0149432_0149547	my dog
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0128388_0128951	so if we wanna make it a special colour in the in the l. c. d. display then we need to pay
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0202439_0202690	and let's see
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0188725_0188880	uh there's no real a real idea
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0114715_0115075	so uh let's see what we have to decide on the on the look and feel
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0175767_0176417	maybe we can design a basic design and then you can build in different colours or different finishes for the buttons
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0042700_0042838	alright think that's right
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0102808_0102940	yeah
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0022828_0023485	if you don't have a lot of space on the remote control anyway then it's just something to keep in mind
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0012334_0013030	well i'm still trying to find out if it's possible to make a remote control with this kind of thing on it
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0090210_0090371	yeah
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0130485_0130598	by your design
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0103811_0104056	uh can you go back to the last slide
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0096671_0096935	yeah a little yellow and a little red on top
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0146201_0147193	uh it can be a little curve on the top and a little curve on the on the side to give it a nice uh new look and to make it easy to use
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0199452_0200023	if we can manage to produce and sell this for twenty five euros then that's fine
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0187426_0187816	they have a little plastic cover of course
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0051054_0051832	and if we make a really small remote control it's easier to lose in your in your living room or something
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0172297_0172966	so that would make for a pretty straight forward design with lots of buttons to scroll through
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0200029_0200753	yeah maybe you can uh yeah a simple design on the on the remote control itself instead of the l. c. d.
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0182218_0182431	maybe the design is the biggest problem in the end
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0027101_0027851	well let's see what what what what we can get with the with the l. c. d. screen
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0094196_0094311	yeah
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0103896_0104247	you have a big picture of a banana on my screen
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0065632_0065748	you don't know me
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0016141_0016636	the materials uh will be changed according to the season
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0016636_0017055	maybe the l. c. d. display should be placed at a higher level
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0143144_0143839	we don't want to spend more than twelve and a half euros on one remote control
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0136326_0136783	because you need a lot of space on the l. c. d. screen to uh no use it
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0165479_0165739	designing a kind of triple r. c.
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0146250_0146840	so we have to take out a little bit of the powerpoint stuff and get back on top of it with our speech recognition
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0116236_0116386	can you go on to the next one
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0036777_0037125	now one two three four five six the last one you can't have like that
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0035170_0035689	so the next meeting is supposed to start in thirty minutes
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0163036_0163363	well i think that we all agree on the basic idea
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0123781_0123904	they they are the expensive
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0096094_0096748	so that we can uh make a back cover in the in the design of that that will be black and white
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0082974_0083549	if you don't if you don't have it then you can just uh make a new one
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0144676_0144923	it looks like it's got a lot of rubber on it
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0052811_0053586	so the l. c. d. screen would be useful if we could implement it which is a little more expensive than the speech recognition
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0124113_0125076	and uh we have some new ideas like um having a fancy look and feel and uh something with spongy stuff in it
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0113892_0114015	the menu
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0162607_0162897	okay what can we decide for now
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0075476_0075617	have to come back to that later
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0077830_0078010	uh oh the next one sorry
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0027908_0028452	well that's in our design but we all agreed on that at the start
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0116197_0116303	yeah
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0072494_0072892	um anyway uh what's my suggestion
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0139591_0140222	so after that there's a little bit of room for the real reaction to put in their own ideas
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0155631_0155945	so there's more space for speech recognition as you can see in this picture
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0083549_0083753	so it should be short
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0028468_0028599	yeah probably doesn't make any sense
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0128993_0129358	uh yeah the display can be implemented uh directly on the product
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0133922_0134042	so now it's my turn
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0024093_0024326	and maybe a hand dynamo on it
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0088348_0088688	so if you take out the speech recognition part it's easy to design
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0159844_0160229	and then you have an extra function for example selecting your l. c. d. screen
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0023009_0023561	maybe that's a little bit more expensive than the simple design which we could have chosen
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0099792_0100604	and the second one is that it should stand out with a spongy feel and then the third one should have a simple design
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0044193_0044767	there could be some changes that they could change the colour or the shape of the l. c. d. screen
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0146840_0147354	and we will design a whole new remote control which we cannot afford to build in right now
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0143016_0143144	it's a simple bulb
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0060335_0061014	yeah and uh this is a new feature which can be uh added for a higher price yeah
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0134648_0135275	um yeah the scroll wheel you can put a scroll wheel on the on the side of the remote control
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0169694_0169928	should a speech recognition feature be implemented
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0051039_0051517	which can be implemented by the l. c. d. display or by voice recognition
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0150324_0150982	maybe there's a little bit more room for the speech recognition and stuff like that
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0004927_0005625	um first of all let's get to know each other a little bit more
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0061664_0062022	and this comes with different colours and different styles
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0148872_0149481	and um basically what i did was looking at trends and new information every time
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0143839_0144355	and they don't want to pay more because it's a little bit of extra money for us
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0149481_0149939	and in my research i found that fruit and vegetables are really important for this type of market
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0046472_0047301	if if you have a l. c. d. screen then uh i don't know if it's possible to get the speech uh recognition
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0018493_0018818	you could see what they wanna take the one with the curve
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0120132_0120531	so that the l. c. d. display works with those advanced chips
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0138383_0138486	okay
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0013079_0013750	um well it should have a more spongy look and feel than any other remote control
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0064779_0065694	maybe it's not possible but this is a nice way to close the whole remote control
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0034196_0034711	so it has to look like the real remote control that is sold in the market
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0078760_0078872	the components design
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0114274_0114940	uh there are the l. c. d. screen uh you can see that they're uh they're oh they're all the same colour
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0168519_0168635	and
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0023683_0024093	maybe it's for example triple r. c. triple r. c.
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0131805_0132583	um and uh an l. c. d. screen can also be used for example on the remote control itself
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0130408_0130522	and you have more pictures
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0101397_0101770	it's more expensive to make a plastic remote control than a spongy one
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0119842_0120132	it's just putting something in an order
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0031419_0031552	come on come up with a solution
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0138188_0138348	take out my remote right here for example
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0104690_0105088	okay that means that the smartboard has to be not lost in the house
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0055573_0056263	there are there are many buttons which have different functions and some of them they can change colours
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0108100_0108406	so this is uh how the remote control looks
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0025022_0025699	uh the advanced uh settings are irrelevant if we drop the l. c. d. screen
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0041040_0041593	which can be done by using the l. c. d. screen and then you should be able to choose which channel you want
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0063815_0064076	technical advanced chip
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0110176_0110781	and uh if you lose the remote control and you have a speech recognition system on it for example
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0087957_0088348	and it's hard to learn how to use a speech recognition system
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0097215_0097446	can you pick up the next slide now
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0174301_0175288	to find out if you lose your t. v. in the house and here is the average time spent watching t. v. in one hour
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0029733_0029926	yeah okay i can skip that
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0141886_0142148	and i'm not sure you will agree to the double r. c.
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0118489_0119311	it's it's gonna be a bit bigger because you're going to put the l. c. d. screen and the buttons in it
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0123998_0124113	exactly
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0094162_0095016	uh maybe we could make a whole new remote control that has an l. c. d. display in it which is really for the young people
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0067389_0067648	which is just one of these which can be changed later
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0010556_0011343	maybe it's more important to make sure that the l. c. d. screen is actually in the in the design
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0152485_0153203	and we decided to make the remote control as it is without the l. c. d. screen
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0155218_0155361	okay
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0059519_0059766	and this one has an l. c. d. display
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0140222_0140793	um i'm still talking about the l. c. d. display on the on the side of the remote
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0071148_0071367	okay well thank you very much
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0093019_0093692	there is a lot of uh technical issues with the communication uh between our remote control and other devices like l. c. d.
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0047301_0048236	but you can change the colour of the l. c. d. screen by uh by pressing the menu button and then selecting a new colour
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0165119_0165290	design and component design
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0083753_0084199	and uh there is no menu uh that are hard to learn
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0017055_0017265	if people are too busy managing
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0134248_0134577	probably any kind of presentation
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0082452_0082974	oh it can be a special colour but that's not part of the plan
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0109916_0110176	and we have uh a button for the l. c. d.
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0164816_0165230	triple r. c. triple r. c. triple r. c. and double r. c.
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0104247_0104633	that's uh that the menu structure is a good idea to have in a remote control
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0072037_0072494	um well let's talk a little bit about what we came up with here
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0149939_0150324	and hard plastic is pretty hard to break in a remote control
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0018818_0019144	uh main functions will be discussed later
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0051517_0052189	so if you want to see the next one you just need to click on a menu and then it's fine
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0056861_0057360	so which means you can use different colours in your l. c. d. display and in your speech recognition
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0057360_0057596	and each can use that one
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0145782_0146250	it has to be good looking because it's really hard to lose our remote control
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0168945_0169070	well i think
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0128530_0128654	that's interesting
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0098714_0098982	uh when you press that button then what happens
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0102181_0103151	so the push buttons have to be a special colour and uh the the the button has to be a special colour on the on the top of the remote control
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0064655_0064779	let's keep the plastic
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0058505_0059282	and this can be used for both the l. c. d. display and speech recognition because you can use it as a menu to navigate through menus
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0113411_0114156	the yeah you can uh take a yellow one and a blue one and a red one for the l. c. d.
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0088688_0089579	uh it should be a little bit uh high tech in the in the remote control and uh here is how to implement it
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0085230_0085823	so we have uh a couple of buttons to change the channel uh volume and uh
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0159121_0159844	um yeah it's it's like you know it's uh it's a remote control for the l. c. d. screen
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0086444_0087057	uh we could have the l. c. d. screen which is like a little bit more expensive but it's the most high tech thing you can do
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0021374_0021488	to finish the design
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0042459_0043076	for example if you have a l. c. d. display taking up space in your in your remote control
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0168722_0168921	but my name is not supposed to be there
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0160229_0160992	um i have a little more information on the user requirements and the market feasibility
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0175288_0175809	you will receive specific instructions by your personal coach
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0037796_0037911	channel selection and
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0013868_0014315	and maybe a l. c. d. display would be cool
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0116861_0117506	uh basically an l. c. d. display is uh it's a little bit expensive in production i think
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0041810_0042459	then there could be a speech recognition component which would go along with an l. c. d. display
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0061014_0061664	and yes it's easy to use but it can be used for a wide range of t. v. s which you can purchase nowadays
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0154519_0154897	you wanna take out the l. c. d. remote control do you
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0173847_0174301	and the marketing expert presented the product
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0131214_0131805	maybe we can have a like a titanium cover on top of the l. c. d. display
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0119311_0119607	you don't you don't need like a l. c. d. screen or anything
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0032145_0032361	and that's not trendy anymore
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0151820_0152029	uh that
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0101828_0102181	every button has an every button has an image on it
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0048236_0048884	yeah the final report should be made by the next meeting which is supposed to take place in half an hour
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0057596_0057810	so can you uh go down to the next slide
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0022213_0022856	and after that maybe we should have an extra option of just having a normal colour on the entire remote control
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0156682_0157287	well yeah but it's a little bit more hard to uh how much how much you have to buy
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0065748_0066286	that could have been a lot worse
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0071367_0071681	uh any new information on costs
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0092199_0092360	can you go to the next slide please
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0168978_0169657	for example a little bit of titanium to make the buttons have a nice shiny finish and some rubber
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0137498_0138269	we don't have a lot of money to spend on the l. c. d. display and maybe we should take out the speech recognition part
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0107871_0108100	then it will be the end of the project
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0130522_0130739	uh we have the fifteen minutes to finish the meeting
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0163363_0163659	that's that's that's gonna be the most expensive part of the thing
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0006997_0007904	maybe that's the best way to start with with opening this one first and then uh open the other one
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0164914_0165021	and also strong
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0055337_0055442	nei press next button
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0110781_0111206	which you can see like in a picture here with the l. c. d.
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0160992_0161438	okay uh i'm going to take a look at the minutes of the last meeting right now
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0120979_0121709	and then you can have a l. c. d. display as well which is like uh an extra option
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0009457_0009814	so we should adapt that
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0030545_0030674	um let's see my p
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0155994_0156254	there could be one with this which could be a big issue
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0076735_0076947	okay uh who wants to go first
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0109602_0109775	and uh the next level up is
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0125076_0126004	well a basic remote control has a simple design but a high end one has a really complex design with uh rubber triple r. c. triple r. c. triple r. c.
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0084523_0085230	and uh yeah because we have a lot of options for uh colours and uh and designs on the on the l. c. d. screen
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0166028_0166645	interface user interface type sample sensor type
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0015303_0016034	in that case the advanced chip has to have an advanced in order to support all the advanced functions
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0161438_0161756	so i'd say give the l. c. d. a two and the speech recognition a one
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0167951_0168227	oh yeah i put it uh for example
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0154766_0155184	uh yes i would like to check if this is compatible with l. c. d. displays
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0169802_0169923	okay right right
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0163060_0163175	but i don't care
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0049852_0050709	can you can you can design a remote control where the l. c. d. screen is uh more visible than the voice recognition
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0106205_0106914	the speech recognition and the l. c. d. screen take up a significant part of the space in the in the remote control
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0170012_0170726	okay so if we're planning on selling this product for twenty five euros and making a profit margin of twelve and a half percent
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0074006_0074814	okay um i think that's the top of it you can't add anything to a remote control
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0014486_0015156	okay then we should have a total price of twelve and a half euros
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0122749_0122929	in in the entire remote control
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0081013_0081722	uh we have to choose a remote control with a fancy design uh for the young customers
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0081722_0082429	okay and the last point is that it's cheap to create a high quality remote control which fits in the l. c. d. screen
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0114940_0115695	and that's uh a simple chip and an l. c. d. screen so that you can uh display text on the on the back
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0156529_0156793	yeah that that would be a good idea i think with the logo
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0029094_0029975	okay so i don't know what uh the other one said or anything more about the design or something
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0046272_0046472	there should be a mute button
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0008138_0008820	uh that is indeed a good idea but it's not something that should be implemented in the design
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0097446_0097754	and how much longer does it hold the remote control
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0115695_0116236	uh and uh there's also a l. c. d. display on the remote
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0023561_0023683	it could be compact
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0037392_0037633	uh channel and volume selection
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0157714_0157817	displayed numbers
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0044767_0045303	the corporate colour and slogan are pretty much the same across the whole product
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0169264_0169694	yeah or like a special colour for the l. c. d. menu or whatever
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0092605_0093019	uh a red and a titanium design
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0011343_0011676	so it's like one piece of information or something like that
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0028659_0029094	okay then we're looking for um trends in design
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0158875_0159324	so i think it's a good idea to get rid of the l. c. d. screen
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0130672_0131029	uh maybe i just have one more slide uh yeah
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0117850_0118489	because um when you have uh some l. c. d. screen on your l. c. d. uh base station
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0119607_0119842	it's not exactly what we are using here
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0130283_0130408	okay
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0108608_0108739	can you take out the l. c. d. screen
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0012321_0013004	so that's why i think it's a good idea to have um well let's see if there's enough money left
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0073178_0074006	well i think it's just a good idea to take the black and yellow together because that's the two most popular colours in the world
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0089579_0090048	and um it would be a nice addition to the l. c. d. with information
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0025804_0026480	uh maybe we should have a l. c. d. display as an extra feature
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0120671_0120979	so that that's a g a green button on the l. c. d.
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0133716_0133830	and that's yeah
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0100604_0101397	then you have a normal push button push button remote control which is just the one that people buy in the store
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0037995_0038100	numbers
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0140793_0141346	and i mean everything that's out there on the market um is already out in the world
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0127968_0128534	so that we can also have an l. c. d. uh display on it
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0096832_0097215	and we have uh a scroll wheel and a mute button
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0148032_0148872	so we're gonna take out the l. c. d. screen because we don't think that's really a good idea to lose our whole remote control
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0095016_0095434	it can't be completely lost if you have it in a dark room or something like that
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0135352_0135967	uh the scroll wheel is just like a normal scroll wheel but you're gonna be scrolling down through the channels
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0169701_0169802	the remote control
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0153362_0154015	and so uh what can we do on top of that
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0056263_0056861	so the first thing which is very important in a remote control is that it's uh nice to have some changeable covers
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0095628_0096094	then it can be used for a l. c. d. display if we want to implement one or not
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0135967_0136326	uh which are two things we have to decide between uh either a one or a two
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0176912_0177406	whatever they want
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0052189_0052811	uh yeah the the the the the remote control should not uh lose in a in a set of things
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0122929_0123067	can you get the l. c. d. screen
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0137172_0137325	yeah but an l. c. d.
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0072892_0073178	but now we're gonna have a little bit of trouble
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0080715_0080945	oh can you uh start again please
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0040287_0040407	come on
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0141346_0141886	because if i'm not correct in my understanding of how the remote control is supposed to work anyway
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0166960_0167250	yeah i would write your name here actually
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0144923_0145145	try to find out how you came up with your score
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0171259_0171654	uh meeting will end after thirty minutes
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0161998_0162607	okay so the goal of this meeting is to come up with a final plan for the remote control
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0144355_0144558	they don't want to spend even one euro
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0074936_0075179	so i think these are the necessary things
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0158196_0158744	maybe it's like a little bit of both because we do have some l. c. d. display thingy
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0157287_0157809	because it's uh it's possible to make a speech recognition uh in the l. c. d. screen
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0077090_0077226	okay and you
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0040685_0040793	next slide please
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0142685_0143016	um people seem to like bright and original things
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0127306_0127968	okay um a menu structure which you can access through the l. c. d. display for example
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0132975_0133592	um yeah so the l. c. d. display and um sample sensor and speaker
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0037914_0038091	yes name or number
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0112409_0113165	the the electronics uh like the circuit board and all that kind of things are hard to implement on a on a little piece of plastic
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0074040_0074256	okay
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0008975_0009457	um it's only a little bit that we need to improve
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0132583_0132975	um in the l. c. d. screen for example it's on top
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0098982_0099792	you can press a button which sends a message to the l. c. d. display and then you get a response from the l. c. d. display
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0157856_0158196	yeah it's not a decision in this project but it's really important
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0163699_0163926	okay pen and paper
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0011777_0012321	so in the beginning of the project we know that it's about twelve and a half euros
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0054117_0054527	so this is one of the criteria which we can evaluate
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0030610_0030733	okay you lose the l. c. d.
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0151717_0151820	okay
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0123124_0123528	uh so these are the buttons on the l. c. d. screen
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0054720_0055229	which is uh a very expensive material especially the hand dynamo
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0085884_0086444	and uh the second important thing is uh speech uh recognition
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0103151_0103896	and the l. c. d. display takes up a lot of space in the in the remote control and the speech recognition part
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0156276_0156529	yeah that could be that could be a scroll bar actually
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0164267_0164756	okay and i think we should also work on a little bit more in the design phase
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0004479_0004718	um how are we doing
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0020468_0020854	uh for the email uh
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0142148_0142685	um this is my summary of the findings last time
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0095434_0095628	it's not it's not hard to hit the right button
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0010196_0010416	so that's very useful indeed
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0030733_0030920	oh okay
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0172871_0173724	and um the l. c. d. display is used to see uh what's on the t. v.
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0138641_0139591	um i'm going to make a summary of what we discussed in the last meeting and see if there's any new information that we missed out
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0150982_0151470	so there's a little bit of extra time for us to see what the other options are
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0126666_0127306	and uh as a bonus we have an l. c. d. menu uh display on our basic model
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0093692_0094109	uh i think a one would be a better example to start with
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0087057_0087957	if it's something like if you have an l. c. d. screen then we should be able to have a lot of information in it which is not really hard to lose
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0137109_0137442	just put it in the folder and close down for now
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0074814_0075047	it's a little bit too big to be on the l. c. d. screen
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0145145_0145782	um i'm afraid we're going to have to cut our meeting short because of the time is running out
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0106914_0107871	well it's not that much of an issue but if you want to have a l uh a little extra in the in the shape of the remote control then that would be fine
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0123528_0123781	uh can you uh start the blank sheet now
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0045677_0045873	maybe there should be a new slogan
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0161756_0162029	it will increase the cost and reduce the profit
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0066729_0067250	so the l. c. d. display is just an optional but it's a little bit more expensive to implement
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0147354_0148032	if we make it too cheap then we're gonna have to drop some of the features just to make sure we stay within our twelve and a half
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0053586_0053930	so the final product has to be one of our company colours or something like that
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0108950_0109602	um if you look at the remote control it's a little bit more on the on the new design side
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0152200_0152485	compared to the previous one of course
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0105088_0105449	is that we use the titanium for the remote control and the rest is rubber
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0126004_0126666	so for a good look and feel uh we should focus on the colours and stuff like that
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0066114_0066729	but that's not a big deal
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0108818_0108950	yeah i have few pictures here
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0060165_0060335	can you go to the next slide now
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0024326_0024794	and maybe not an l. c. d. display for the channel selection
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0116663_0116861	the green one is a banana
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0009814_0010097	and of course it should be something
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0105449_0106205	and the l. c. d. display will take up a little bit of space in the in the in the remote control itself
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0164048_0164176	okay
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0167428_0167885	um the l. c. d. display um which is used for like menus
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0144558_0144676	and i'm working on this project
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0136783_0137172	so i think it's a good idea but we're under twelve and a half
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0165087_0165205	yeah
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0129358_0130124	uh the l. c. d. is a new feature that we can uh add to our remote control
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0116498_0116663	so this is uh the hand dynamo
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0084199_0084349	and it should be really light
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0074229_0074411	yeah i think it's yeah
AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0076254_0076643	actually i think people are willing to spend the extra money for a good look
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0078010_0078122	it's it's for the l. c. d.
AMI_IS1009c_H02_FIO084_0117506_0117850	uh it's it's a part of it but you can't lose the curve anyway
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0033756_0034196	okay and as i mentioned in the first discussion this is a new feature of the l. c. d.
AMI_IS1009c_H00_FIE088_0158654_0158929	well y you you have to take it easy
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0049045_0049572	imagine a spongy remote control it's a plastic cover in a spongy material
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0043076_0043969	then there can be a second menu which is uh the l. c. d. screen that can show the menu structure and the third menu which is the speech recognition
AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0057900_0058505	so this is one of the main reasons why we have the l. c. d. display which is uh yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0147480_0147945	but why wouldn't you want a one with the speech recognition
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0011091_0012013	maybe a special colour for the cover which would turn out to be fruit and vegetables in general
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0103051_0103417	let's say twenty five centimetres wide then
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0005591_0006464	um in the last meeting it was decided that we should focus on the ease of use aspect
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0131014_0131379	so i think we got back a little bit ahead of schedule in that regard because that was good
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0029697_0030149	so we have to find a way of uh that people will really be interested in that
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0166342_0167206	uh i think we can also make uh a little bit of change in the in the shape because it's not such a big issue
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0178437_0178646	yeah definitely
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0180745_0180864	yes we could
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0183540_0183677	yeah menu
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0169598_0170293	and then maybe we can do something with the l. c. d.
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0179899_0180315	we decided we wanted to use yellow and black which is pretty easy to do i guess
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0054300_0054709	but we have an l. c. d. display which is called special colour
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0131419_0131783	um i think one is really easy
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0168775_0169598	so maybe we can do that later when we have more money to spend on the l. c. d. display and stuff like that
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0044970_0045542	um we decided not to implement a speech recognition in the remote control
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0093918_0094226	um advanced chip on print
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0141656_0141844	yeah i thought it was like that
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0144961_0145310	okay
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0084556_0084761	perhaps i'll make a summary of the last time
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0098501_0098936	that's a that's a re a reason for the for the curve i think
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0120514_0120928	one of the one of the big selling points i wanted to bring out here was the l. c. d. screen
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0064511_0065246	you don't have to hold it in your hand all the time but you can still read the buttons on the l. c. d. screen or whatever
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0162068_0162501	anything else you'd like to add or are there any new information we could have used for the meeting
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0084864_0085297	yeah now this is what we had our agenda for today which was a little bit short
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0178402_0178668	yes you do have an l. c. d.
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0057045_0057353	so it takes the place of the l. c. d. and the speech recognition
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0180636_0180757	yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0146395_0146789	okay um so on off switch
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0141654_0141780	yes it is
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0158088_0158204	oh i'll give you the three
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0165682_0166106	yeah l. c. d. information and um channel selection yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0144286_0144428	oh no
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0094872_0095121	uh regular chip on print
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0133730_0134107	and we're still going to go for the two push buttons so that's good
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0053896_0054005	the product is good
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0034072_0034535	okay for the rest of the presentation we have the numbers
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0148505_0148664	yeah i think one is a safe choice
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0070404_0071261	uh these are the two key points that are to be taken into consideration on the on the design of this remote control
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0067786_0068008	the colour is very trendy
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0142596_0142934	and i'm still working on the prototype presentation
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0059316_0059420	that's a good point
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0190501_0191179	yeah we'll we'll have to find out
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0111535_0112165	now we have to make a decision about the product which will be launched later on
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0185896_0186554	we have a total of sixty minutes and we have to make up our end report
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0065246_0065653	take out the rubber and put it in there and let me see how long it lasts
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0042426_0042999	yeah but you have to see the buttons are uh it's a small part of the menu or something
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0189421_0189660	oh get out of here it's not working again i guess
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0183545_0183798	yeah we were really good i think
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0067081_0067808	yeah so you don't have to look at it and say oh yeah that's a special colour for the l. c. d. screen or something
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0014410_0015315	the industrial designer um the user interface designer
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0138250_0138356	oh yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0077093_0077224	yeah it's a snake
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0079632_0080257	my personal preferences is that i think we should go with an l. c. d. display if it's available
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0117552_0118356	we don't want to sell it at twenty five but you can sell it at twenty one and still make a lot of profit on it so that's something to think about
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0161160_0161279	yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0023384_0023891	perhaps the l. c. d. screen could have been added as a special option
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0049751_0050264	because we are limited to twelve and a half euros according to the initial budget
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0112217_0112448	okay i'll take it back to my room and you can find out
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0072255_0072883	well one thing i can agree on is that there will be a remote control
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0123207_0124124	so the fact that people are willing to pay extra for the l. c. d. screen and the voice recognition is pretty good
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0076855_0077167	yeah we have the spongy feel now
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0127341_0127967	well i think it's still the same thing but we take out the l. c. d. screen and replace it with something else
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0183727_0184471	uh i think we did alright so in the end we didn't really see a difference
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0074614_0074775	yeah of course and yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0177258_0177401	um
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0033325_0033798	and that's the final conclusion of the last meeting on the project management
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0178213_0178697	well i don't think you get a lot of t. v. s out there
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0095977_0096116	oh no
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0047312_0047703	yeah but we need that information for the marketing expert
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0110834_0110979	um
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0152668_0152819	uh i give it a one or a two
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0073384_0074001	yes the buttons will have their own uh l. c. d. display and it will have the same numbers as well
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0133554_0133711	eight eight and a tie
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0030916_0031126	that's pretty easy to do if they really want it
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0094226_0094356	is that what we used
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0078678_0078822	yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0086822_0087076	so strawberry
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0042228_0042451	oh that's not that's not a great feature
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0086184_0086437	there is a problem with the remote control
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0135522_0136083	because if we take out the speech recognition and the l. c. d. screen that's quite a lot of money
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0178586_0179168	uh i think we're really trying to make something very new and great
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0013227_0013457	yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0073933_0074457	so you have to lose the the numbers that we need for the l. c. d. screen so that's not a problem
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0122686_0123207	and people find it very boring to look at a lot of options and pick the one that's good enough
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0155051_0155410	okay i give it a two yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0074001_0074203	yes which can be easily implemented
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0103669_0103947	oh ten twenty five and a half
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0191856_0192197	take out the microphone from here
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0079005_0079329	well what are the features of such a remote control anyway
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0061773_0061987	okay the next meeting is at half past two
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0156922_0157788	well it's not that much more expensive but you also have to think of all the other things um from the remote control
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0159432_0159557	well um
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0151338_0151479	okay
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0124124_0124344	they don't have to talk at the same time all the people in a group
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0119781_0120514	yeah i think this is the real remote control that people are looking for in the market right now
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0121283_0121644	the side which is black is one curve and the side which is white is a double curve
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0069314_0069519	so you can press one of those
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0188646_0188930	how i how i came up with my design by the way
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0187669_0188086	for example if you make the production price twelve and a half euros profit
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0090085_0090281	so we use i mean we do
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0170425_0170535	the volume control
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0068008_0068633	um there's the menu button um or the l. c. d.
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0122239_0122686	even if it's lost in the house that's good news because you get a little bit of free money
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0140907_0141086	so that would be a better
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0035625_0035939	um so that's what we have here is the menu
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0028058_0029057	maybe it would be better to do one of those ones that we could work on together and then uh draw out a final design later on
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0069159_0069314	seven out of ten yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0188280_0188412	so you think
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0158869_0159019	uh a three
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0119064_0119388	we're gonna give it something that it didn't get in the first place
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0154776_0154971	uh i think i'll give it a two
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0043039_0043332	and then uh for the logo and
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0098936_0099082	okay then that okay
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0114846_0115717	okay well this is the first meeting i think it's more important to uh make sure we all agree on the design
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0085663_0086259	but i'm still thinking about the idea of putting it in the l. c. d. screen anyway
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0176806_0177143	yeah i think uh personally i prefer a three
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0100797_0101105	okay we don't put the curve in it though do we
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0123878_0124032	because that's gonna be a problem
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0118628_0119064	and then we just have to look into that and see if we're able to do it on the budget or not
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0155919_0156691	and i had a little more information than what was actually shown in the last meeting
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0098722_0099264	so that's basically the same as our standard remote control has
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0052399_0052600	uh the menu one is a menu
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0174986_0175438	so the question is really how do we lose the possibility of the l. c. d.
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0189656_0189882	we don't have to sell it
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0182537_0182670	yeah i think that's true
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0019599_0019852	and how would you push the button now
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0051690_0052136	but our normal colour is black and yellow on the on the case or something like that
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0126043_0126301	there's there's really a lot of extra cost
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0161362_0161910	um well i think we're about to get rid of the rubber anyway
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0128975_0129552	and i guess we got the same information that it's going to cost a little bit more
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0009020_0009435	maybe we should have a menu button in the top right corner of the l. c. d. screen
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0085140_0085243	okay
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0180322_0180811	yeah maybe we could do a little more work on the user interface that would be nice
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0013485_0014410	but uh really very few people are interested in speech recognition so the speech recognition part might be a little bit of a problem
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0080276_0080937	and and then basically the speech recognition would be a nice extra feature
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0078888_0079032	that would really work
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0083897_0084011	and the voice recognition
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0012013_0012926	um anyway there are some issues with speech recognition um which we should probably look into
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0143817_0144241	um i'm afraid that's about it for me
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0153405_0153617	one one okay
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0170918_0171804	and um maybe we could come up with some new ideas on the l. c. d. screen and stuff like that
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0097826_0097962	uh rubber
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0147227_0147341	give it a one
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0190111_0190291	uh oh
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0124378_0124658	um so they're all small in their own way
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0108986_0109101	from my email
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0152988_0153157	oh i like the curves
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0177613_0178216	and the rest is pretty much the same as we have here except for the colour and the pen width
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0101930_0102129	yes do we have to sell the buttons
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0136202_0136654	so that we had to be a little bit more creative
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0114688_0114846	yeah right
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0127967_0128408	so i think we're looking for a remote control which is really small
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0169338_0169663	yeah maybe a two yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0134116_0134616	okay we have a menu uh menu structure for the menus and stuff like that
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0058041_0058417	the name and the colour of the new product
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0090983_0091358	triple r. c. triple r. c. so you take out the l. c. d.
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0133822_0134090	we have the numbers yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0158223_0158340	okay
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0140581_0140742	feasible changes
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0179398_0179899	and i mean we have the l. c. d. which is uh pretty new
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0063112_0063579	well i think what they want is a little bit of light on the remote control right
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0093443_0093918	so in that case um the l. c. d. screen is not an option
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0035939_0036376	is this a remote control that has the logo on it
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0061477_0061773	so this is a problem
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0077167_0077358	go back to your slide show right now
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0097444_0097645	well plastic isn't
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0086604_0086809	but that's after the finance
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0146050_0146395	so now we are supposed to think about this
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0145937_0146050	yeah indeed
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0092731_0092979	okay okay yeah let's see
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0053724_0053828	oh
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0069986_0070147	yes this is the menu
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0098878_0098991	let's give this a one
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0049439_0049590	oh
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0031293_0032097	uh the second thing is that we should stick to the l. c. d. display which is a little bit more expensive than the speech recognition
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0068759_0069052	and the buttons here
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0108661_0108807	uh just draw that i think
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0054854_0055307	uh especially if we have a special colour this is not such a big deal
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0188476_0188646	okay
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0167206_0167460	if we have to make one more decision
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0152819_0153059	well i really like dark colours not light at all
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0116800_0117268	maybe we can get an extra special colour for the l. c. d. display
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0091530_0091813	and then i should just check it out to see if it works
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0163765_0164417	okay so what we're really focusing on here is uh the ease of use for our target audience
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0066948_0067118	that's a good that's a really good idea
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0065653_0066194	you'll get a little bit more detailed instructions on that later
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0185498_0185849	yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0107999_0108108	yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0030288_0030916	and um it should have a feel of spongy material to give it extra strength
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0019263_0019471	uh and of course the special colour
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0071408_0071569	scroll up scroll down a lot
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0152596_0152725	colourful i mean
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0095286_0095859	that's one curve that we take out of the double curved case okay
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0186776_0187153	um i think this was a good example
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0152066_0152323	um and how long are we gonna be done
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0058428_0059316	so when you take out the l. c. d. screen and the speech recognition uh function you're going to have a lot of space in your budget for the l. c. d. screen and the speech recognition
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0100368_0100500	scroll wheel no
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0056591_0056916	if it takes the right time to draw it then it's lost
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0149676_0149785	oh six
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0185374_0185896	at least a banana
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0059376_0059485	okay okay
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0094238_0094352	yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0017284_0018010	to find out a little more about the l. c. d. screen and speech recognition
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0085297_0085576	okay now we talking about finance
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0190479_0190598	oh yeah but we have a time limit
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0118356_0118628	so we have to give up on the speech recognition
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0048112_0048363	and the side of the mouth
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0110431_0110834	maybe you'll pick up on it
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0155570_0155756	oh maybe it's a two
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0041445_0042426	um but the l. c. d. is a bit more expensive and uh it's a lot more expensive than the spongy yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0096533_0096673	it's got double curves i guess
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0094685_0094872	okay one
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0184947_0185232	uh is a product evaluation
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0067684_0067788	it's okay
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0074976_0075613	but it has to have some kind of spongy thing in it because otherwise it wouldn't be able to um
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0104663_0104891	okay eleven minus one
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0182303_0183135	yeah i think especially if we lose the l. c. d. display and the speech recognition thing it's actually a little problem
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0185367_0185861	um then the sample sensor
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0048363_0048767	then we have one curve on each button design
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0048890_0049190	for changing the covers of the remote control
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0171906_0172054	and maybe it will
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0076128_0076730	and one of our main goals is to have a profit of twelve and a half euros by the end
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0077042_0077318	so it's yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0132429_0133181	and uh i don't know how we can add that to our r. c. or not
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0148683_0149060	okay one okay
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0150516_0150699	and i think i would give it a two at least
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0139103_0139488	since we have some extra time at the end of this meeting
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0105236_0105427	so we look like we are
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0102276_0102552	and special material yeah rubber
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0149756_0149886	you give it a four yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0003938_0004133	well anyway hang on a minute
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0075924_0076155	okay yeah just make sure that one's in there
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0092477_0092677	can you just fill in the l. c. d. numbers now
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0062120_0062796	maybe it's a good idea to have the l. c. d. screen on top
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0067220_0067346	yeah that's great
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0099509_0099901	and then we have the push buttons and the l. c. d.
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0006564_0006687	did i
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0059919_0060901	and the l. c. d. screen which is an advanced chip and with which we would need a more advanced chip in order to make the l. c. d. display
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0185590_0185884	oh
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0104683_0104824	that's
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0094559_0094685	come on
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0065317_0065522	after two and a half hours it's over
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0081579_0082128	oh we have to take out the l. c. d. thing anyway
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0022804_0023264	and that's more expensive than the regular model which is already on the market
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0089637_0089762	okay now
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0016564_0017116	instead of having a speech recognition feature that should be integrated in our product
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0138351_0139103	and maybe it will get lost in the in the middle but it's okay
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0165536_0165724	yes we can also implement it
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0159803_0160156	it looks like we got a good product but it's not perfect
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0034881_0035112	the black is just a little bit darker i think
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0084011_0084185	there are two people going to be there
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0183135_0183441	uh did we need um do we need a finish
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0119388_0119535	um next slide please
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0069570_0069806	but if you lose it then you have to draw a picture of it
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0029213_0029697	so many new t. v. s are being sold to forty five year old people
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0068745_0069236	the buttons here are for the menu and the next three buttons are for the t. v.
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0141086_0141328	you don't know what's going on with the l. c. d.
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0046331_0046436	uh-huh
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0141252_0141534	um well this is my list again
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0142934_0143589	um so let's talk about finance again because we still have a lot of stuff to put into this project
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0052836_0053649	we have the basic colour scheme which is black and yellow which is our primary colours in a in a little bit of innovation
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0109683_0109836	okay fine
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0153617_0153839	um how about the feel
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0140779_0140907	okay
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0044413_0044878	and the banana button will be a special feature on the l. c. d. screen
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0097223_0097444	case material special colour
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0071387_0071489	oh it's very good
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0022216_0022696	the shape should be a little bit like this one which would be pretty cool
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0150247_0150389	um i don't know
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0180493_0180786	blue blue yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0117268_0117552	and the production cost should stay under the twelve and a half
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0128456_0128620	and i think our colour is great
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0154126_0154680	take into consideration um the technical implemen technical function
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0168404_0168517	yeah definitely
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0072883_0073380	if people like that they want to pay more for that kind of product which is not true
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0038429_0039128	and the l. c. d. screen you can also add it but it will be a little bit expensive in the end
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0131783_0132180	and the final report was not in the shared folder which i found out
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0106093_0106272	yeah i suppose i should have said that
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0103915_0104042	maybe you just
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0125417_0126043	okay so um i think that's a one on a scale
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0130090_0131014	we decided to go for the l. c. d. display and i think that will add a lot of functionality to our design so we should definitely go with the l. c. d. display
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0098268_0098462	uh but but that's
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0144660_0144894	well i can't remember what i said before but
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0062821_0062982	okay well um
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0071589_0071843	uh i don't think it looks like a smartboard
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0046564_0046958	uh no we have an l. c. d. screen in the back of it
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0170535_0170789	maybe we can put that on one of them later
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0046289_0046397	okay
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0088686_0089440	okay so that's an r. c. battery and l. c. d.
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0114272_0114502	okay just want to make sure the l. c. d. screen works
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0165869_0165978	yes features
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0087996_0088686	okay um now we're at the end of the first meeting
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0171858_0172740	yeah well we already know that you can put all the buttons in one place so that's not really a big problem
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0071210_0071387	okay
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0064279_0064480	yeah the buttons are also rubber right
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0050738_0051294	and on top of that we are going to sell our product for twelve and a half euros in the international market
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0129552_0130090	um and i think you did a fantastic job in a really short amount of time
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0082128_0082331	you really have to be the boss
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0148666_0148936	yeah m yeah you mean spongy isn't
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0110140_0110431	okay so that that's the good goal
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0184719_0184848	are the costs within the budget
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0042922_0043023	oh
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0026431_0026654	and easy to use would be key i guess
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0096704_0096864	double curved
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0145310_0145611	yeah let's see how long this meeting is supposed to be
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0063579_0064261	you can even draw it in a little bit more if you want to really see the shape and not only the numbers on it
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0141540_0141654	oh i don't know
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0093328_0093443	oh go away
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0148244_0148497	okay but one and a half
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0080981_0081579	yeah well i think that's a good example of uh what they really want to see
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0128620_0128975	and the double curved case we really got a good deal on that by the way
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0178981_0179274	yeah i think we yeah i think we did a good job on the l. c. d. too
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0124658_0125417	so that's about the final design and you have to go through a lot of possibilities there
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0140240_0140346	the colours
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0074373_0074971	we're going to make a basic design and then we need an advanced version which is gonna be expensive because of the l. c. d. screen
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0177170_0177576	yeah i think it's pretty much the same as what you can put on a remote control
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0103508_0103763	uh i think that's the problem
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0100500_0100770	we'll include l. c. d. display in it
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0078699_0078921	yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0082708_0083555	so if we take the pink remote control and put the l. c. d. screen on it i think the young people will like it
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0114600_0114759	you don't wanna lose the curve
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0032218_0033189	and the speech recognition should be a big part of the design and uh should be on top of the cover i guess
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0087539_0087996	okay and we have lost the l. c. d. screen
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0084293_0084575	okay now that's up to him
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0172740_0173341	perhaps we can have a little discussion on this one which product is the best
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0066194_0066948	um in the end i think the look and feel is more important than the amount of profit
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0082445_0082708	remote control is lost in the couch
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0185232_0185367	yes
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0079329_0079718	that's the real reaction remote control that people are looking for
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0149863_0150178	yeah i give it a four just for the look of it
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0108969_0109144	yeah i mean it's okay
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0013037_0013522	and that's just a plain old chip on print
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0133143_0133582	well we have um what's our target audience anyway
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0108807_0108969	my computer is damaged
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0097975_0098164	we're gonna have the special colour buttons
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0164981_0165391	are are there any more possibilities for our remote control
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0149060_0149273	and how about solar cells
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0069948_0070393	the menu button is the one that opens the l. c. d. screen
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0034773_0034881	yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0137150_0137939	okay but the question is what are we gonna do with the l. c. d. display just to have a little extra information on the menu
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0104079_0104235	eight and a tie
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0174552_0174661	um
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0111164_0111424	so i think that's pretty uh very important
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0083555_0083713	so i think those things are pretty cool
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0103665_0103782	that's the price
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0182205_0182421	and we used the speech recognition but it's lost
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0101319_0101533	uh special colour and button
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0039502_0040024	you have to lose the buttons
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0039300_0039665	yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0072104_0072410	okay now i'm supposed to uh yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0151479_0152066	okay here you have the idea of what it do do on the remote control
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0155687_0155789	okay two
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0075541_0076079	then we can put the l. c. d. screen on it because it has to be in the same place as the l. c. d.
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0145622_0145736	you can make it there too i think
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0092979_0093328	okay one okay
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0121644_0122239	we have the first one is the smartboard which was supposed to be the last but we'll get to that in a moment
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0137939_0138351	so we have to decide on what's gonna be a little bit of that special colour
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0120928_0121283	we're going to work on that because it's a little bit of a problem
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0010653_0010780	um
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0043332_0044239	it's a little bit of an innovation in the in the design of the remote control but uh it's a big deal
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0186464_0186776	oh so i think you have a little time
AMI_IS1009d_H01_FIO087_0190292_0190402	it's not for the l. c. d.
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0151175_0151364	yeah i think you want it to be yellow
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0069703_0069948	and press the menu button on this
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0013217_0013332	that's right
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0137920_0138077	yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0187272_0187669	do we think that's a good idea to put the l. c. d. screen
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0038147_0038429	and uh also in the complexity score
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0138186_0138315	yeah
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0147945_0148244	um what do you think of the shape
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0136654_0137085	and now the final report uh will be made in thirty minutes
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0134767_0135522	but as you may have noticed we have to make a final decision on that anyway
AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0134602_0134830	well that's um
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0027036_0027745	for example if we want to make our product more attractive to the younger customers that's going to be a problem
AMI_IS1009d_H02_FIO084_0166106_0166342	we can make the buttons feel like spongy material
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0023811_0024629	uh we took a look at the market and uh found out that fruit and vegetables are trendy
AMI_TS3003a_H01_MTD011UID_0096589_0096752	okay
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0026316_0027089	um there's a problem with the remote control we are using is that it's lost
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0124053_0124159	well it's on the way
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0055437_0055560	oh that's
AMI_TS3003a_H02_MTD0010ID_0143150_0143256	they were all manuals
AMI_TS3003a_H01_MTD011UID_0097650_0097761	okay yeah
AMI_TS3003a_H01_MTD011UID_0147421_0147542	okay
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0002125_0002332	yeah
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0111506_0112430	um as you can see um we have a remote control for your television set
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0039305_0039673	but then you have to fill in the specific details
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0135420_0135720	but i don't know if the l. c. d. display will affect that
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0112430_0112648	our selling price
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0036390_0036563	uh a triple r. c. p.
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0137424_0137534	let's keep the speech recognition
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0121790_0121955	yeah
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0028819_0029177	but i think you already know it's about it
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0104855_0105283	did you draw it yourself or just copy and paste
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0134250_0134482	so we have one different design
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0002332_0002629	okay so
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0047793_0048367	um first of all uh just a summary of some new findings
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0021934_0022335	um okay what are we going to do
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0072964_0073228	that's true
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0033524_0034263	so we have a little bit of time left here to work out what it's going to look like in the final design
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0045592_0046119	so let's go on and see what we can get out of our twelve and a half
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0018423_0018701	have you seen an email from him
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0001673_0001955	well see you in half an hour please
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0016134_0016442	maybe the next time you can make a l. c. d. display
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0128777_0129653	and you can use it in any kind of uh device you want to make a remote control for example with your t. v.
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0145518_0145955	and we can also work on our own uh project
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0032189_0032473	so that's what you get by doing that
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0115933_0116883	so we still have to make a product that's not too expensive but at the same time we want it to look like a high end product
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0033218_0033524	then we're going for twelve and a half euros
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0061241_0061469	now get out of your teletext
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0047133_0047351	so everybody's happy with the meeting anyway
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0037867_0038005	the pen
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0085882_0086049	if you're really losing your scroll wheel
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0062718_0063066	okay
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0066182_0066320	maybe you have to
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0035682_0035790	so we can see
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0109896_0110175	okay
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0087944_0088144	there are plenty of battery options
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0145174_0145405	finish meeting now
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0131716_0131893	so that's a pretty handy tip
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0034870_0035579	um there's a line on top here which is about the volume button
AMI_TS3003a_H01_MTD011UID_0128504_0128622	two
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0121006_0121414	so just a little bit of green on the l. c. d. screen is nice i guess
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0071194_0071407	go ahead
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0025776_0025899	it's also uh
AMI_TS3003a_H01_MTD011UID_0138219_0138494	oh no i mean uh you know what i mean
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0010687_0010968	it's a bit more important than the material
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0143328_0143680	explanation and uh discussion of course
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0136138_0136478	but that would be good if we could really do it
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0122107_0122208	does it do anything
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0009014_0009424	so our product is a double r. c. c.
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0045264_0045479	and then we're going to try out the digital pen
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0081822_0081983	it's nice
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0145405_0145518	okay
AMI_TS3003a_H02_MTD0010ID_0103983_0104246	my name is big brother
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0040965_0041081	then uh
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0050930_0051366	uh there's a little bit of something else you have to know
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0140877_0141040	that's a stupid battery
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0112946_0113775	um we have to get rid of the l. c. d. screen because it's really taking up a lot of resources
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0074356_0074838	maybe it's a little bit more expensive to get the l. c. d. screen
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0037144_0037423	do we have to get done today or something
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0116883_0117060	it won't break
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0120140_0120442	is it easy
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0123799_0123948	okay but it's a bit of a problem
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0049213_0049607	uh i can't start this at all
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0026037_0026206	that's the name of the remote control
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0072463_0072613	and i'm gonna draw a bird on it
AMI_TS3003a_H02_MTD0010ID_0058364_0058516	oh
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0108818_0109508	so if you have any ideas on what we're gonna do with the l. c. d. screen or anything like that
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0046785_0046932	well it's rubber anyway
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0029177_0030124	um the design of the remote control is going to be based on the current trends in clothing and interior design
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0082994_0083320	they're all black they're all black with a little bit of silver on it
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0036897_0037144	uh a simple red apple
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0108374_0108495	that's pretty clear
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0041240_0041513	uh talking about speech recognition
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0003809_0004274	so i don't know if anyone has a little bit of money left
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0035790_0036251	and you don't have to do all these extra functions on the on the l. c. d. display
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0052990_0053502	let's see there's a nice button
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0136591_0136893	and for example the remote control itself
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0059063_0059197	and then uh oh okay
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0057762_0057892	thought about a smartboard thing
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0047534_0047721	going to be uh a double r. c.
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0108495_0108818	so why not do both with the voice recognition anyway
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0132568_0133401	if you make it a little bit more expensive than the one that we can do with the regular chip then this will increase the price
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0142216_0142437	maybe it's not a little bit dull but
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0019753_0020054	oh it doesn't work here
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0041935_0042279	double curved i think for example
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0049787_0050177	you can lose the l. c. d. display and uh pick a nice blue one like this
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0007797_0008416	um they don't have the same problem as all the other uh telephones that are out there at the moment
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0053502_0053863	now you'll get my specific design by email
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0011666_0012227	well if we're not uh no if we're not using a remote control anyway
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0024629_0025214	and the l. c. d. display is uh definitely an innovation that's added value
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0014966_0015902	um then i can say let's make a let's make a new one
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0010947_0011353	that's interesting
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0037423_0037867	um then we get a profit
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0108160_0108374	okay
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0008416_0009014	because then you don't have to deal with the l. c. d. uh
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0097550_0097667	rubber
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0016442_0017136	yeah i don't know if it's uh you can just look at the numbers or something like that
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0137840_0138045	my remote control is totally lost
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0027089_0027568	the functional design phase is for uh user interface design
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0120698_0121118	okay so that's a great idea
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0059354_0059576	let's see this
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0130868_0131716	so if you take a look at your remote control and you see that it has a pretty straight forward design with the volume and the teletext button
AMI_TS3003a_H02_MTD0010ID_0101447_0101812	oh just tell us something
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0122342_0122553	maybe you just have to load it again
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0141432_0141994	well i'll have to talk a little bit less about that because we still have to deal with the budget problem
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0110175_0110677	it's a hand dynamo
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0069157_0069319	it feels like rubber
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0022335_0022735	um are we gonna use a special colour for the packaging
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0009424_0009919	there's there's some more information on the l. c. d. screen
AMI_TS3003a_H01_MTD011UID_0088960_0089086	okay
AMI_TS3003a_H01_MTD011UID_0089086_0089595	uh i'm gonna draw it as a banana
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0144935_0145048	and then we can lose all that
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0063989_0064107	maybe it has to be a little bit bigger
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0123396_0123568	channel selection
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0134676_0135420	um maybe we can see if we can do something with the l. c. d. screen
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0041513_0041935	we put the fashion in electronics so we're a little bit short on that
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0022735_0023113	and it has to be original trendy and user friendly
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0058204_0058330	yeah i agree on that
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0074838_0075126	because i'm gonna do this a little bit later
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0018701_0018949	one thing i forgot
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0059878_0060429	after a couple of minutes i got a new design to go with
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0142562_0142726	that's a nice idea
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0014290_0014771	uh we are concentrating on the younger target group which is approximately forty percent
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0133989_0134250	yeah it's nice
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0023113_0023811	so uh this is the overview of all the things we uh
AMI_TS3003a_H02_MTD0010ID_0104256_0104553	but uh
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0030124_0031102	um the user interface design takes you to the conceptual design phase and the detailed design phase
AMI_TS3003a_H01_MTD011UID_0099306_0099539	um a yellow banana
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0005415_0005801	um let's start with the last part of it
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0057113_0057800	oh i think it's just a little bit too bad the remote control doesn't talk back to me
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0007037_0007797	you will have a remote control with all the features that are available in your uh remote control
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0123948_0124102	okay i'll think about that
AMI_TS3003a_H02_MTD0010ID_0100934_0101447	so i'm gonna draw a turtle because it's a good way to
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0126555_0126717	yeah
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0011206_0011375	let's do the rest later
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0133645_0133757	that's gonna be a problem
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0143680_0143793	keep it corporate identity
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0017136_0017525	uh is it okay if you change the colour of the l. c. d. screen
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0130326_0130868	and then you can add the fruit on top of it or something like that
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0138102_0138274	yeah
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0129653_0130326	so you have it in your hand and it's a little bit awkward to operate all the l. c. d. displays
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0064300_0064408	up down okay
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0124381_0124649	uh it's lost the l. c. d.
AMI_TS3003a_H01_MTD011UID_0120696_0120802	five minutes okay
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0132139_0132460	but um the other
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0028113_0028683	hello again from the l. c. d. screen
AMI_TS3003a_H01_MTD011UID_0129479_0129580	okay yeah
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0004703_0004842	welcome
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0044097_0044751	it's a bit more expensive but you'll pay for the spongy feel
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0104111_0104351	yeah it's pretty straight forward
AMI_TS3003a_H02_MTD0010ID_0105690_0105971	okay so it's a bit of a problem
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0088144_0088316	and that's just a little more easy to
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0139500_0140030	um i will make the minutes of this meeting available in the project folder
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0088855_0089191	just pay attention to the l. c. d. panel for example
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0118948_0119275	so that's a little less to discuss on our
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0038005_0038928	um it's pretty much the same thing as you would find in a normal remote control
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0006558_0006834	uh i think you still have a lot of time left for the project
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0118393_0118770	and my personal preferences uh total score of eight out of ten
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0058494_0058654	well
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0046119_0046785	just give it a yeah just give it a little bit of uh
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0005014_0005415	uh let's see
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0018949_0019052	the
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0128030_0128442	and i think it should be made out of rubber just to make it a little bit more durable
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0064408_0065073	it's gonna be a little bit of that thing that you have to think about when you're designing it anyway
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0109508_0109679	is it uh pretty easy
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0099496_0099666	yeah just a blank sheet
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0047394_0047534	okay
AMI_TS3003a_H01_MTD011UID_0130635_0130751	okay yeah
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0117394_0118393	okay um the marketing expert wants to find out what people want in a remote control by trend watching and trend following
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0004274_0004381	oh
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0070477_0071194	so now i'm gonna give you an overview of the plan and the budget
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0114717_0115143	um but that's the last item on our list
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0019089_0019267	maybe i can start it off with a presentation
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0032473_0032816	but all the buttons will be made of titanium then
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0053863_0054193	it's not very much uh
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0035579_0035682	there's some features
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0117060_0117394	so just to remind you of the project plan
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0083669_0084081	for example yeah
AMI_TS3003a_H02_MTD0010ID_0101812_0102060	it's a different kind of story again
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0051366_0051895	just go to the left and then you'll find out that it's a little bit of a problem
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0111125_0111506	the final product of a remote control
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0019605_0019753	if this is where you see it
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0144376_0144790	okay then i'll make the minutes of this meeting in the project folder
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0119783_0120140	so i'm gonna send it to you
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0133775_0133967	so i think you can take out the l. c. d.
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0139019_0139500	so um can we think of anything else here
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0042279_0042895	but that's also a little bit of a problem because you will end up with the rubber all over the design
AMI_TS3003a_H02_MTD0010ID_0143042_0143150	oh
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0054362_0054579	oh let's see we have to drop the l. c. d.
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0043941_0044097	the side is pretty small yeah
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0127508_0128030	one of the one of the twelve euro twenty five euros for the for the design
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0025298_0025776	and we use our double curved case of course
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0042895_0043697	so if you have the l. c. d. display on top of your remote control it's a little bit more expensive than without
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0146818_0147455	okay i'll make another one at the end of this meeting
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0110677_0110990	so we've got the total of twelve and a half
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0141085_0141213	how much longer is the meeting supposed to be
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0039673_0040011	but we're going to make it in a different way
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0040011_0040261	so okay
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0017917_0018314	well have you come up with the l. c. d. screen idea
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0050177_0050801	because then you'll get lost in the l. c. d. screen which is going to be a big problem
AMI_TS3003a_H01_MTD011UID_0098652_0098803	so
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0047311_0047578	oh
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0135720_0136021	so that's something we have to think about a little bit
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0001955_0002125	so where is the speech recognition anyway
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0021274_0021934	it's not really the real remote control we're looking for but it's a little bit more
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0126251_0126555	like you can use them or not
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0003595_0003809	it's almost impossible to do
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0068484_0068929	uh it's a one or a two i don't think it's worth the effort
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0058654_0058775	we're not going for the l. c. d.
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0063399_0063541	yeah
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0082050_0082163	with of course
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0137040_0137329	maybe we can make it uh
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0014063_0014177	is this our agenda
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0121519_0121952	oh maybe you have to make the l. c. d. screen
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0065073_0065319	but i just don't know
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0126909_0127508	like we talked about a couple of days ago a little bit down on the durability and a little bit up on the cool factor
AMI_TS3003a_H02_MTD0010ID_0105971_0106118	because like i said uh
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0006834_0007037	and you can see uh the final report here
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0147455_0147639	so good luck
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0063066_0063677	it's a delicate process i don't think
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0013476_0013865	but i'll introduce you to my personal preferences by the end of the day
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0120442_0120622	of the market i guess
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0084307_0084551	well maybe you can also draw an animal on it
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0038928_0039305	you can also select the colour and the line width
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0140149_0140381	yeah one of the little things yeah
AMI_TS3003a_H01_MTD011UID_0097240_0097352	that's the one
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0071435_0071629	okay
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0073228_0073584	okay but i'm not sure if we have a menu here
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0044751_0044947	you can stick the different designs behind it
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0119275_0119783	we've got five minutes left for a total of about two and a half
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0070319_0070477	it feels like rubber
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0012227_0012529	uh it's an integral part of the concept
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0057962_0058204	so so it's a bit of a side effect yeah
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0083396_0083669	let's see the real remote
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0104568_0104700	the most important things are
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0036563_0036897	an advanced chip for a basic remote control
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0020054_0020335	okay no problem
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0115233_0115933	um our marketing expert can tell us a lot about current trends
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0049607_0049787	well
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0080540_0080833	is this my um
AMI_TS3003a_H01_MTD011UID_0137977_0138110	for a product uh
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0034263_0034870	and you get the same shape as we have here but with rubber on it of course
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0018314_0018423	yeah
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0027568_0027992	the functional design the detailed design and the conceptual design
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0128564_0128777	yeah i've got one of them up here
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0058775_0059063	we've got the l. c. d.
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0010968_0011206	uh okay
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0065568_0066182	oh my name is not okay
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0140381_0140763	maybe it's better to drop the double r. and put it in a single r.
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0096816_0097227	oh sweet
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0072127_0072250	and use a different design
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0070024_0070319	my document is a copy of the actual document i think
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0020335_0021274	but there's a remote control with the l. c. d. screen um which is more expensive than the regular one
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0040261_0040873	and uh it's very trendy to have a spongy feeling in your uh remote control
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0113775_0114717	uh we are going to have different colours and different designs on it so it's kind of unique for our customers and they want to have their own design
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0001346_0001673	oh good morning
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0009919_0010145	uh i'll start with the presentation again
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0012529_0013476	we put the fashion in electronics and uh we made it a little bit more expensive than the other products on the market
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0059684_0059878	oh it's a cat
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0017525_0017917	yeah we have an advanced chip on print isn't it
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0004590_0004703	but
AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0080139_0080540	okay
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0060429_0060744	uh it's
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0112648_0112946	uh my personal preferences are a five
AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0048367_0049213	uh the other thing is we don't use a lot of buttons on the l. c. d. display
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0147559_0147956	let's just take the take the l. c. d. display
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0167313_0167540	there's nothing more that can be added to this design
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0032210_0032702	um user interface was clearly specified to be totally spongy
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0123095_0123267	yes
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0096340_0096614	so this is a scroll wheel option
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0189311_0189747	and it should not be a very expensive part of the whole remote control
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0194768_0195087	um functional changes
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0177991_0178153	so i think that's uh
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0145856_0146019	or is it teletext
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0067608_0068347	well uh what i found out is that the energy source was uh kind of like uh um
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0141918_0142419	so what you choose is totally dependent on the l. c. d. display
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0209085_0209464	it's better to put it at the bottom than at the middle
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0009312_0009719	so we can make that uh the second most important
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0133100_0133414	three and a half euros fifty centimetres
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0162025_0162220	and i don't have any more money left
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0037943_0038068	design
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0190417_0190679	so some extra information
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0198880_0199316	um let's say the special colour is black
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0089709_0089819	we'll have to look into that
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0162508_0162612	have to finish my email now
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0203801_0203905	so that's the
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0147057_0147374	is the energy uh really being used or something
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0112666_0113257	um this is a bit of a problem um the finance part
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0058658_0059215	the user friendliness uh i think the remote control is uh very easy to use
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0142809_0142949	yeah okay good
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0017511_0017947	so that's just a little summary of the process i had to follow
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0058444_0058658	um yeah
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0089727_0090130	um maybe you can tell us a little bit more about your experience
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0183919_0184252	and you just press the button and a beep goes
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0205042_0205196	to have to look into that a little bit
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0176788_0177115	um the l. c. d. is a bit heavy
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0157740_0158506	if you want to just take a normal one you don't have to fill out a lot of extra stuff like if you want to fill out a lot of extra stuff
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0156213_0156360	if you i think if you only look
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0174570_0174717	uh at least the functions
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0193639_0193800	oh
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0035438_0035637	they don't seem to sell very well in the market
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0203850_0204211	if we're really looking to implement a advanced battery
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0193270_0193639	um let's see what they'd say
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0158491_0158797	um maybe we can include a special colour in it
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0064041_0064353	oh yeah oh yeah
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0206234_0206344	in in any colour of course
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0061158_0062113	yeah i think uh one of the most important thing in a remote control is uh uh a little bit more uh innovation in it
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0110739_0111063	uh maybe it's also a little bit too expensive to implement
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0031550_0032074	which are not very easy to use but they still seem to be very important in a remote control
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0137251_0137367	we don't have the cost
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0178256_0178456	that's a good title for the first page
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0170166_0170339	only for the l. c. d. yeah
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0068347_0068665	like the uh on a banana or something
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0093285_0093468	the user presses a button
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0177604_0177913	and maybe the speech recognition if it's still there or not
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0114648_0115449	and uh we have to keep in mind that our production price is uh twenty five and a half
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0092777_0093003	um how about fruit and vegetables
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0029867_0030117	and a touch pad takes up a lot of space
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0205739_0206094	uh i don't think they have such a thing they don't sell titanium
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0070895_0071491	um what i thought was um you take out the l. c. d.
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0178456_0179363	okay if we have a fancy look and feel that's not really the same as a simple design
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0087143_0087685	um a kind of uh an extra for the trendy look
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0079706_0079809	uh yeah
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0193869_0194233	to finish the design phase should be finished in thirty minutes
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0009959_0010273	um function presentation
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0161363_0161899	and the l. c. d. screen you could use a normal t. v. remote control for that feature
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0010273_0010705	there's a little inconsistency in the details of the email
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0187315_0187701	think that's a little more expensive than the regular remote control we have to look into
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0197899_0198437	people really like the idea of a remote control but they don't like to pay extra for it
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0129104_0129298	yeah but the price is not a big issue
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0088627_0088837	well maybe a slight adjustment could be fine
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0209464_0209598	okay
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0057741_0058050	yeah should go to the top i think
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0015769_0016354	uh then we can have a discussion about the new project requirements which are still pending
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0093099_0093285	everybody knows what remote controls are
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0151402_0152064	um i think it's clear that we can use the l. c. d. display for example
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0032702_0032943	one and a half euros or seventy percent
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0163275_0163548	they're not used to speech recognition though
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0111672_0112578	uh the goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product which we are going to sell to the market which is about twelve and a half euros
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0190939_0191060	that's a good idea i think with the l. c. d.
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0180850_0181039	to have an extra layer of protection in it
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0079809_0079945	so that's a good
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0027508_0027939	and they prefer the look and feel of fruit and vegetables in their remote control
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0126238_0126970	uh maybe we can uh take a look at the different remote controls which are on the market to see what they offer
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0052436_0052805	but it fills up the entire remote control
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0142763_0142882	yeah
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0079945_0080395	um the the buttons are uh the buttons are used um a lot in the menu
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0175413_0175845	yeah i agree with you about the l. c. d. display but we didn't make a lot of progress on that
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0162693_0163275	and that's a bit of a problem if we have to lose the l. c. d. screen anyway because of the cost
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0182000_0182443	yeah the final report will be sent to me after a couple of minutes once we reach twelve and a half euros
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0166497_0167313	the only problem i have with the remote control is that people don't really like to change their covers every time they buy a new remote
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0184706_0185126	so it's not too expensive i think
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0206761_0207008	let's see we've got five minutes left
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0167618_0167813	the number of the pen
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0104926_0105724	um so i'm here to tell you the minutes of the last meeting um the project plan discussion and the closing
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0182965_0183188	yeah that was used i suppose
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0114304_0114648	uh around the remote control itself
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0017291_0017511	so we've got fifteen minutes for all of it
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0191151_0191307	but i don't know if that would be
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0116026_0116572	uh yeah and we have to keep this in mind while uh building our product
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0149346_0149725	another important part of a remote control is the
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0148167_0148477	so that's definitely a good idea for the l. c. d. screen i think
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0023220_0023526	um let's see what the market share is
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0066354_0067014	um there's a bit of a problem uh with the remote control being lost in your living room
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0123533_0123878	like the first picture i made but that's a bit of a short cut
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0125292_0125439	in not in original design
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0062994_0063317	but it must be uh a user friendly
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0199966_0200687	because i think we need to go for a little bit more design wise because of the time
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0121414_0122133	in addition to the financial aspect there is a little problem with the technical implementation of speech recognition
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0074276_0074438	is that a duck
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0124406_0124593	yeah
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0089266_0089531	it's pretty straight forward and you can get your job done
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0212102_0212432	the user interface designer design the user interface concept
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0136466_0137249	if we make a if we make a remote control like this then maybe we should just drop the l. c. d. and the voice recognition
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0135277_0136073	if we if we make it like this i think we can lose the numbers on the bottom because you don't have to look at them that much
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0096005_0096340	it's a very simple it's a totally different product
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0153794_0154038	actually i don't think it's really that much of a problem
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0023890_0024460	well this is a triple r. c. i suppose we all agree on that
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0115449_0116026	so it has to be designed in a way which is very appealing to the audience
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0072551_0073217	uh the remote control is uh a thing you hold in your hand
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0030700_0030927	there are some new findings on them
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0111183_0111672	uh the other one is uh a simple uh product name
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0083631_0084232	well i think we're going to use a green one for the l. c. d. uh display and a yellow one for the buttons
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0133626_0134077	because they really don't want to pay extra for a cover that they can't use
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0172304_0172602	that would make it a double curve on the back
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0181259_0181390	um
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0068974_0069596	uh you don't have to uh decide on that because it's everybody's own decision
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0155441_0155821	up and down is for teletext up and down is for volume
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0204681_0204871	yeah
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0014502_0015365	um first of all um we have uh the product name and the slogan from top to bottom
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0214081_0214385	so um i think you missed out
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0033502_0034115	um seventy five percent of the users say they zap a lot um changing channels and volume
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0092001_0092351	oh it's not going to take too much time
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0093468_0093999	the remote control is designed to be used by people under the thirty five years old
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0012157_0012339	and when it's inside
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0202807_0203198	uh i think it would be a good idea for the remote control to have voice recognition
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0049655_0049890	so you know where it is in the menu
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0101208_0102046	so in my opinion it's uh it's a good idea to do it in the in the same way as we did for the speech recognition
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0143323_0144055	oh no we can't take the l. c. d. thing but that's fine
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0092373_0092777	okay i got a presentation about the working design
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0083172_0083306	okay
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0022936_0023220	uh in our design we made it simple
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0081303_0081664	uh even uh older people uh younger people
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0164236_0165076	yeah maybe we can do it on the l. c. d. screen if there's some room left because it's a little bit more expensive
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0148680_0148786	maybe we can
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0205234_0205344	okay
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0157219_0157339	maybe we can
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0213492_0213955	uh the sample sensor and uh the speech recognition part can be implemented
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0160699_0161089	there's nothing more expensive than a t. v. remote control i think
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0176306_0176456	yeah
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0094422_0094811	so um the goal of the project
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0194469_0194768	designer taking over
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0044727_0045175	um this will be the basic design of our remote control
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0184323_0184706	so the l. c. d. display should be possible
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0143035_0143275	but the double r. c. is better to agree upon
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0164005_0164236	yeah this is the menu
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0034874_0035285	um they need to use a lot of channels
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0146664_0146971	it definitely not a good idea to take a lot of battery power
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0149725_0150587	for example if you make a basic uh remote control with one button it's a very simple design
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0142419_0142809	teletext volume and channel selection
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0148948_0149123	let me make that
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0026467_0026733	um a remote control is not very important
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0073217_0074145	um like you said uh a lot of the time on the on the bottom uh can be done in one colour
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0024753_0024963	the fifty percent of the people um
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0116878_0117215	let's have a discussion on the functional design
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0144197_0144587	um can a fancy look be achieved
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0159304_0159450	there are other ways to do that
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0051958_0052436	seventy five percent of the people they lose their remote control often
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0159649_0160168	so the younger segment which is between sixteen and twenty five is not so important
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0010914_0011288	there's another curve going on there
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0056775_0057117	um for the for the extra features um
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0126970_0127577	so the remote control is pretty much the same for everyone if you just want to make it for a specific t. v.
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0046539_0046695	they shouldn't break easily then
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0139830_0140726	oh maybe we can uh focus on the l. c. d. display and the speech recognition for now
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0132456_0132604	so let's try it
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0065128_0065479	um yeah
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0018794_0019337	yes i think it's maybe you'll have to implement this later as well
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0012339_0012853	so it would be a good idea on the on the l. c. d. screen
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0138722_0139011	um yeah i think it's simple
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0006370_0006777	okay so this is the menu structure
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0090130_0090669	uh then we'll have the l. c. d. display which is a little bit more expensive
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0022556_0022822	we have uh another twelve and a half euros
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0136073_0136281	the yellow the middle of the r. c.
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0206842_0207000	okay
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0056028_0056139	okay okay
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0152064_0152168	um
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0166167_0166497	um having a fancy look and feel is important
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0186523_0186974	um i think we should take the l. c. d. screen into account in the design as well
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0043379_0043672	because that's really the most important feature of a remote
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0138068_0138346	change the cover i think for our own design
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0160326_0160525	um that's not too bad
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0099441_0099841	uh first i'd like to start with the user interface concept we discussed earlier
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0041757_0042217	um this is something to take into consideration
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0084251_0084427	oh i don't think so
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0202427_0202807	it would be something that we could do if there was a little bit more time
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0167813_0168082	uh i think it's very important in the design
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0129558_0129973	and they don't really spend money because they are not satisfied with their product
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0191464_0191584	it's the smartboard
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0171766_0172184	so i think it would be great to incorporate the colour into our design somehow
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0158984_0159154	or like a joystick
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0192941_0193270	otherwise it will be a problem i think
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0113257_0113682	because uh the ending of the meeting was uh
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0078648_0078763	oh
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0210596_0210808	uh okay
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0036524_0036731	they're not really interested in fruit and vegetables
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0156251_0156713	so we can uh we can stick with the l. c. d. display
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0007276_0007726	um now we're going to find the financial information
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0054992_0055160	uh the ten and a half
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0047164_0047851	let's make it a little bit more than the average remote control that there is on the market
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0152324_0152617	you should feel the buttons are spongy material
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0177403_0177504	because it can go
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0175939_0176153	but i don't think we should stick to simple material
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0188928_0189068	would it tell you what it does though
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0122133_0122543	so i think it's pretty tough to put a lot of new stuff into it
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0069903_0070183	um personal preferences
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0157258_0157508	if you take out the kinetic thing do you lose it
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0025097_0025633	the people they really liked uh the remote control that was easy to use
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0132822_0132961	that would be the thing i like about it
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0123298_0123436	um
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0093999_0094301	is it the fruit and vegetables thing which is supposed to be trendy
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0036731_0036997	but they don't spend a lot of time learning to use it
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0052805_0053574	also i think this could be a great opportunity for us to explore the l. c. d. display which is still quite expensive
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0144587_0144776	but only if it doesn't
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0083042_0083237	it was my uh the marketing
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0049890_0050392	uh in the end it should be a remote control that you could bring with you to any room in your home
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0057571_0057860	so we come up with a total uh
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0087816_0088287	uh a total of uh twelve and a half euros
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0130070_0130315	what the remote control looks like
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0082268_0082577	so um
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0012853_0013438	so i don't think it's gonna be a good idea to close it now
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0026733_0027332	people only use ten percent of the buttons on a remote control so they don't pick up the entire menu
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0078034_0078621	so you don't have uh all the buttons on one uh one page
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0208209_0208360	and different designs you can uh
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0030335_0030700	my personal preferences from the remote control
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0136509_0136610	you have to open that
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0154417_0154858	even if it's not a lot of money but you don't know if it's enough to buy an l. c. d. screen
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0145903_0146395	but teletext is uh a bit of a niche for the young people
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0173197_0173663	the only thing we have to make out of it now is the remote control for the t. v. to talk back to
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0015365_0015769	so i think we stick with a simple design and take out the l. c. d.
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0040047_0040342	um we should make this a feature to be added later
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0187166_0187291	to make it a little too small
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0021426_0022302	we are using a universal remote control so we have a little bit of extra room in the design budget
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0020965_0021091	but you already know that
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0214385_0214656	and i think we have a nice layout now
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0046162_0046539	and there should be more use of those colours so they could
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0180192_0180428	yeah maybe we should do something with the l. c. d. screen
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0078621_0079045	so that's uh my idea of the market
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0022302_0022556	um we fell a little short of the budget
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0105824_0106739	um this is um we have to decide on the overall design of our remote control
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0079045_0079323	um and yeah
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0016439_0017291	and uh the one thing we decided on is that you don't change the colour of the front and the design of the inside
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0185920_0186591	um i don't know if that's true or false but let's call it a one
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0118933_0119896	yeah it's pretty much the same as you would get in a normal t. v. remote control but just give us your name or something like that
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0054103_0054516	so anyway um any new ideas come up
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0044041_0044727	but i think the l. c. d. display is a pretty useful tool for people who want to make use of their t. v. in a more advanced way
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0153532_0153701	so it takes a bit of space
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0096802_0097017	the power source
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0124958_0125107	repeat that
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0173800_0174434	so you could focus on the l. c. d. display um for the speech recognition
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0086683_0086961	uh yeah uh you got the curve
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0191519_0191635	that would fit in the total
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0042921_0043379	so these are two things that i think should be included in the l. c. d. display
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0034414_0034874	there is a market for this kind of remote control in the global consumer market
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0171006_0171553	there's a lot of different remote controls out there but most of them don't have the speech recognition function
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0005751_0006002	every person has a blank sheet of course
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0095206_0095983	take the l. c. d. display and make it a two point five and drop the speech recognition and the mute button
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0088539_0088654	it's not
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0154858_0155329	you need a new one with the speech recognition in it
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0051711_0051826	um this was
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0196037_0196280	and material details
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0017947_0018134	um who wants to be first
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0110183_0110739	um just an example of the new features we could implement in it
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0013438_0013584	then our agenda
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0057117_0057273	um
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0203379_0203681	and i think that would be a good idea to make it a triple r.
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0108096_0108600	uh apart from the speech recognition we have a two point six
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0183188_0183919	you have yeah you have some extra buttons on the side to change the volume and stuff
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0029664_0029867	the power button knock on it
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0014036_0014375	uh you are going to have a presentation
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0154391_0154617	if it's only for television yeah
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0100488_0101105	and you have to make it easy for the user to use the remote control in different d in different rooms of your house
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0199316_0199966	people are willing to pay extra for a little bit of extra high tech technology okay
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0113682_0114200	so we have a bit more time for the final design which is about twelve and a half euros
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0096614_0096802	you got the buttons
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0038600_0038984	um first of all i have the agenda for today's meeting
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0043807_0043933	um functional requirements
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0104177_0104926	okay now we have a little bit more information about what it's actually going to look like in the end anyway
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0139312_0139830	uh the next meeting is uh supposed to be in thirty minutes so we don't have that much time
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0168763_0169041	if you have a lot of buttons you can lose them
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0040660_0041614	the remote control is a one piece of equipment that covers all the functions that i wanted to uh put into the l. c. d. display
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0047962_0048678	and i suppose it could be a little bit more expensive to make the l. c. d. display
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0127660_0128305	um in the lower part you have the volume and the channel control if it's possible
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0018374_0018562	okay
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0190015_0190170	uh just a normal scroll wheel
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0030117_0030222	so there is the more
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0103836_0103943	yeah
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0181117_0181259	that's a good point
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0145134_0145705	but i don't know if it's possible to make a remote control that looks like the one we have now or not
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0168193_0168763	you can make a basic remote control with the functions that people want uh think they want
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0204248_0204535	after two minutes you start to get tired of it anyway
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0152829_0153239	that's a very important uh thing we have to find out
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0130315_0130688	let's just take a look at the prices and see if they fit within the budget
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0119896_0120197	and new televisions will have an l. c. d. display
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0185430_0185692	is the pen size okay
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0170217_0170897	because if you have a lot of rubber on the remote control it's not really easy to draw a simple design
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0151220_0151330	uh that's a good idea
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0009719_0009959	but this is fancy
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0067014_0067502	um uh they don't like it um personally
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0054623_0054829	about the functional requirements
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0033214_0033502	then this is the menu uh there we go
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0192427_0192580	for an l. c. d. screen
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0020813_0020965	the marketing expert
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0182457_0182939	so maybe we should implement the l. c. d. or something
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0079456_0079706	uh let's see
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0146395_0146506	so it's uh
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0099094_0099441	keep in mind the scroll wheel is a bit of a problem
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0013747_0013911	uh i'll take the minutes this time
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0204510_0204648	yeah the re yeah
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0045670_0046162	uh the l. c. d. display and speech recognition are special features
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0021210_0021426	um i've done some research
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0214794_0214936	so that's a good thing
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0190238_0190469	still has a spongy feel to it
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0189896_0190015	just the l. c. d.
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0179700_0179902	so we're just going for the l. c. d. display
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0136552_0136731	sebastian pretty much
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0134196_0134605	people want to pay for a little bit more than they want to pay
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0157711_0157911	maybe we can use it
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0031087_0031550	the l. c. d. display and the speech recognition um are standard
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0107878_0108096	so it has to be simple
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0187701_0188355	and we're having a total of twelve euros and fifty centimetres in production price which we want to sell
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0125241_0125383	uh i think we can
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0048678_0048985	maybe it's a good idea to talk about it a bit more
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0124422_0124559	yeah it's it's a
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0056139_0056775	um i had a lot of information on the user requirements
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0068665_0068974	yeah uh a look at the price and it can be okay
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0085768_0086683	uh i think a one or a two because uh the l. c. d. is something new on the on the market
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0023526_0023664	what are evaluation
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0188355_0188928	maybe it would be a good idea to just put it in a list of all the possible options which you could give to the user
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0082698_0082833	yeah
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0176456_0176671	do you think the docking station works
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0208521_0209085	but you have a little bit of an idea that it would be better to put the l. c. d. screen in
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0014375_0014502	all of you
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0122736_0122840	pretty much impossible i think
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0165328_0165493	they don't have to be all that long
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0156200_0156318	but do you need it
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0169161_0170001	yeah i think it's more important to make sure that the remote control doesn't do any damage to your t. v. or anything like that when you're using it
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0097468_0098059	the product name and the corporate colour and the slogan of the company
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0006124_0006370	that's nice
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0122956_0123091	take out the extras then
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0028894_0029664	channel selection volume and teletext are a lot of fun on a spongy remote control i guess
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0063317_0064041	so you can uh yeah you can uh put a lot of information on it for example
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0020685_0020813	my name is frank markham
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0038068_0038336	uh i think we should make a remote control for the t. v.
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0159450_0159649	if you look to the left it's just a two
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0089605_0089727	that's right
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0116572_0116721	so i suggest
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0028533_0028894	then we decided that the remote control has to have some l. c. d. screen
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0180531_0180733	whatever uh whatever people like in their home
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0085069_0085648	oh no it's just a one uh yeah it's a one curve
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0128305_0128992	the the shape of the of the box is pretty uh it's not so flat on the inside
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0209880_0210323	uh then uh a second thought
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0097017_0097468	and get the push button which is going to uh turn it around
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0062844_0062948	so um
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0165076_0165328	but i think they might not buy it but they won't
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0197688_0197944	so i think we need
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0098558_0099094	well i think we should use a simple material for the l. c. d. display
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0150587_0151173	we'll take a look at all the buttons and see if there's enough space for an extra button on the top or something like that
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0030927_0031087	that's what i'm looking to tell you
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0035285_0035438	but they are also very critical
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0177426_0177604	it's not too fancy though
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0064536_0064638	remote control
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0177261_0177426	yes it could be possible but
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0117494_0117796	so is there any new project requirements or product specifications
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0130873_0131668	but maybe if you make a different type of remote control that doesn't have that much in it
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0138501_0138636	we can uh we can lose this
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0083306_0083610	and what's the most expensive part of the equipment
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0081664_0082268	so uh the case material we can uh take is uh black or silver
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0011288_0012018	but that that you can make a lot of different designs with the with the with the buttons that have to be lost
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0038336_0038480	and this would mean we'd s
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0157508_0157740	let me think of new ideas very quick
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0181642_0181868	you guys let's see they let's see they use it a lot
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0065479_0066318	um yeah you can make a remote control for example with uh some different colours and some different shapes
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0025633_0026285	and um a menu structure that would be implemented in the l. c. d. display would be a lot more expensive
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0088287_0088515	so it's possible
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0039082_0039938	uh this will be the most expensive part of the remote control because it's made out of all the materials that we'll buy
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0194233_0194469	we took forty buttons out of that
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0165401_0166063	but i don't think you can make a whole remote control out of titanium if you're gonna add an l. c. d. screen to it
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0098059_0098324	you can press buttons when you want to switch pages for example
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0144873_0145134	oh the curve here
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0064353_0064588	in one uh remote control
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0156654_0157219	do you want the button to be a one or a two
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0084751_0085069	so it's not an um a kind of uh real reaction
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0070183_0070706	the user interface uh design uh for a specific uh device
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0189596_0189709	okay
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0185126_0185279	uh another uh
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0042217_0042921	and it turned out that the remote control was not hard to learn how to use for people under forty years old
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0120197_0120863	but i think if you take the l. c. d. display for example there are a lot of people that prefer titanium
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0172285_0172393	so we can
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0201135_0201925	for example if we want um the l. c. d. display we can put uh a lot of money in it
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0211226_0212102	um the design of the remote control is what we are going to focus on and let's see what the end goal is
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0209598_0209880	so that's the total uh
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0013584_0013747	the first one of course
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0035786_0036423	um the first meeting starts at five o'clock and the last meeting ends at six o'clock
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0045327_0045670	uh i think the most used buttons should be fresh and bright colours
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0137249_0137872	we don't have the on off button we don't have the down function and the up function
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0163548_0163860	so let's stick to the basic speech recognition
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0146597_0146751	so i just had to um
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0161089_0161238	and so you would need like
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0037535_0037811	what i find with this is um
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0109601_0110069	uh we don't need an advanced uh signal in front of it
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0197489_0197688	so it doesn't really matter
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0207517_0207794	you could have i think it would be nice to look into that
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0174959_0175210	flat and uh spongy in between
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0207894_0208113	adaptable to different cultures
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0080994_0081294	everybody uh has to use it so
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0131668_0132456	the the thing that i like about them is that they don't fit in the palm of your hand very well
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0019337_0019787	what do you guys think about having a fruit on top of it
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0125551_0126238	and um we could do the same thing with the l. c. d. display which is a little bit more expensive
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0120976_0121278	the line width is very thin when you see it in black
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0057462_0057571	yeah you can take your time
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0080395_0080994	um yeah a bit of a curve uh that you can use for the l. c. d. screen
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0094811_0095206	just cut out the advanced options and double click on it
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0024460_0024753	um remote control is being bought
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0183158_0183548	if you make it like this with a curve on one side you lose the curve on the other
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0205344_0205642	and different colours
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0088968_0089266	but the but it won't be very difficult
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0075919_0076452	um and uh here you have a basic remote control with our l. c. d. screen
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0006777_0007100	and still uh fantastic
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0099841_0100301	because you have to go through the whole process of designing a remote control which is pretty big
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0124320_0124873	if i'm if i'm gonna give this a two then i think we should lose the l. c. d. screen
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0006002_0006124	yeah
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0062113_0062844	so uh you have uh a little extra time to uh develop a a a design for the l. c. d. display
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0202051_0202252	the real particular black and yellow
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0134753_0134976	let's see it's on the l. c. d. screen as well
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0207058_0207517	and with the with the l. c. d. screen and the speech recognition
AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0210808_0211226	uh the profit aim was to make a profit of twelve and a half
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0048985_0049629	and the chip would send out a signal which would be turned into a beep by an l. c. d. screen
AMI_TS3003b_H01_MTD011UID_0084427_0084751	uh you get a curve uh through the curved uh thing
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0130770_0131353	okay just the menu button that's it
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0002425_0002837	oh there is a meeting later
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0174291_0174398	let's see
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0184486_0184687	so um
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0074312_0074615	um it's the most uh
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0149655_0150094	oh no we should just i think we should just do one design then
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0081673_0082321	um for example the l. c. d. is an advanced um chip which we can buy
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0227452_0227764	and i'll get started again with the second meeting then
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0009600_0009800	we have about fifteen minutes
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0065300_0065977	yeah but we have to uh come up with a name and an idea for the l. c. d. screen and um
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0024509_0024960	um the functional design is pretty much the same
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0171773_0172086	especially if they're in the same room as a lot of time
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0172641_0173234	we can make you can make a remote control and sell it for twenty five
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0128122_0128372	so that brings us back to the initial idea
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0024960_0025462	um the third requirement was that the product should be original it should be fresh
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0203714_0204151	and um the top button to be a four
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0196328_0196430	so
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0029507_0029830	okay this is a very general summary of current trends
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0181069_0181520	because the plus and the minus button will appear on the l. c. d. screen
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0226173_0226653	oh it's yeah that's a problem
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0139515_0140064	it's a little bit too hard to to get into the design of the remote control
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0039958_0040170	so it would be kind of a triple remote control
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0201075_0201425	um let me take this out
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0110186_0110964	but um i think it's important to make it a little bit more trendy in the design
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0089554_0089817	but what we don't implement
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0003961_0004309	presentation three
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0143261_0143413	you could lose the l. c. d. screen
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0053794_0053930	and um yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0079471_0079573	and that's it
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0199283_0200043	um let's see maybe it's possible to make a little bit of this
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0158991_0159180	yeah and you can check the l. c. d. yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0182100_0182349	maybe it's just a
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0108773_0109157	so maybe the l. c. d. display will give us a little more profit
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0120250_0120970	and the menu button um should go to the l. c. d. menu which will take up the extra space
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0121791_0121961	okay i think that's a good point
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0130356_0130466	and maybe a triple r. c.
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0075199_0076041	so um uh some extra buttons for channel selection and uh and uh volume up and down
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0195514_0195759	because it's a bit of a big issue with the l. c. d.
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0206592_0206761	and then fill it up a little bit
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0111626_0112214	and then we could use the menu button for the l. c. d. screen or something like that
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0046820_0047237	uh some extra information uh on the speech recognition
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0137033_0137275	could make a new cover on the on the remote itself
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0203157_0203536	so yeah so it's uh for example um
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0053386_0053794	um let's see um
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0061666_0061790	um
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0220198_0220771	but i think you got your speech recognition and the l. c. d. screen
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0186534_0186785	because that's the basis of your design
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0212509_0213175	yeah and then we can have a little more yeah let's see
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0139459_0139560	probably
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0061035_0061248	and uh yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0095554_0096021	okay um the second thing is that we should take out the l. c. d.
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0206339_0206592	if you can have this one on your table like this
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0144813_0145796	it's a good example of something that we can talk about and discuss and get an idea of what's possible and what's not
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0185783_0185988	one or the other one and uh
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0151853_0152059	that's a good thing about the l. c. d.
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0137188_0137359	oh i don't know
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0183799_0183930	yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0158787_0158889	well it's better than
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0048681_0049088	uh to draw in the in our design
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0049675_0050406	um something about uh some extra features on the on the remote control
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0139212_0139515	so i think that's okay
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0046417_0046820	um yeah okay um
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0047237_0047969	um we had a few um issues uh about the material and the shape
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0103372_0103559	great product and a pretty good price
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0018267_0018452	good luck
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0060394_0060972	uh you can see uh the l. c. d. uh screen on it
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0098719_0099113	you don't wanna spend twenty five euros on one thing
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0031200_0031633	the material of the remote control
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0180434_0180553	it's the palm of my hand
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0079633_0079787	oh no think
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0177270_0177482	yeah there's a little l. c. d. screen
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0186194_0186534	yeah i think we should stick to speech recognition
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0156003_0156236	doesn't really matter for the design of the remote control
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0089817_0090047	we should discuss that i think
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0121214_0121773	and i think the remote control should not make use of fruit and vegetables in a negative way
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0033107_0033520	um there is some extra time to complete the last phase
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0004309_0004844	okay so um this is the agenda for today's second meeting
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0213608_0213958	uh then uh the buttons are out of the way
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0107490_0107720	oh it's not true
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0020995_0021224	um we don't have a smartboard
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0160188_0160709	um maybe we can make it a little bit longer
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0009911_0010221	uh so let's just skip that i guess
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0098436_0098719	but i don't think that's really an option
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0042533_0042730	people lose many buttons
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0015611_0015755	maybe we can get an idea of that
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0166715_0167669	uh on the on the other side uh for example uh the one with the spongy uh yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0033520_0033933	uh the remote control will be in a standard black and red uh design
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0090047_0090706	um the basic design of the remote control is uh the same as the previous one
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0008404_0008621	then we have three presentations
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0153151_0153312	could you could lose the entire concept
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0012469_0012758	the technical part of the remote control
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0091621_0091739	okay
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0101923_0102499	and you made a decision about the materials that will surround the l. c. d. screen
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0051584_0052263	um yeah just from the finance um you have to calculate the production cost
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0112333_0112954	um what i found was that the younger people are willing to pay more for a remote control
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0009142_0009383	are we going to make it hard
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0193316_0193600	so those are the three of us apart
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0185566_0185783	maybe make it a little bit flat
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0226788_0227235	so if you have a lot of uh information on the product it's not a problem
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0224481_0224778	so that's basically uh
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0044059_0044222	yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0219286_0219527	and product evaluation
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0174621_0174748	uh blank
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0071219_0071824	you can uh put on a on an extra button for example this one here
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0006622_0007580	um you're supposed to give your presentation uh in about thirty minutes and this is the end of the meeting
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0005162_0006095	um and uh the financial aspect of this project um is a concern of our company
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0138925_0139061	oh i don't know
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0137803_0138136	yeah but it should be easy to do if we could have just
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0201850_0202217	um so in the light of your findings um
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0059078_0059315	so uh yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0050406_0050725	so maybe we can uh use that as a
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0088725_0088913	full instructions will be sent to you
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0083360_0083601	so i don't think it's really an option
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0141930_0142143	maybe it's possible but it's a little bit
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0129126_0129227	um
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0165829_0166715	so it's possible to uh put a logo on the on the remote control for example if you want to uh sell it in the international market
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0057459_0058127	it's uh a possibility to make uh a speech recognition uh remote control for example
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0177772_0178107	uh i think there's no
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0204961_0205386	but i think it's better to put the l. c. d. on top
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0077623_0078316	so um for example uh the on off switch and um channel selection
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0151424_0151767	so which again gives us the average of twelve and a half
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0043838_0043943	oh
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0097798_0097992	yeah those are the user preferences
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0196767_0197266	oh yeah you can uh take out the l. c. d. screen
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0061248_0061666	the top of a fruit or something like that uh spongy
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0130590_0130714	and that's the best choice
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0100902_0101010	okay
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0167669_0167929	or is it
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0034226_0034797	um now um this is a discussion group again
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0174029_0174194	then you have to
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0012177_0012469	um this is the agenda for today
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0123848_0123971	so pretty little
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0038550_0039085	there's not really a lot of space here to make uh this is a pretty simple product
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0082829_0083360	but if we take out the speech recognition then we could drop the curve as well
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0074788_0075199	uh the most people like uh yeah plastic or rubber
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0004844_0005162	the second is the technical aspect
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0154727_0154954	and would channel switching and volume control
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0194709_0195514	uh the l. c. d. screen um seems to be a little bit more expensive than the regular chip
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0006125_0006409	uh conceptual design specific design
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0105280_0105864	uh i don't know but maybe you can use uh a l. c. d. display
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0050939_0051241	uh and a yellow uh l. c. d. display
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0159369_0159722	um so the interface type
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0110964_0111441	so you have a button on your t. v. which sends out a signal back to your t. v.
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0078471_0079304	um yeah so the idea is to have uh a remote control that uh fits into your uh home for example
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0202695_0203157	so the remote control uh has to look and feel nice
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0205911_0206150	um but this is a pen
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0063253_0064204	um um the top goal of this project is to uh come up with a basic uh basic design
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0094506_0094825	so this is the evaluation we have to do
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0133455_0134119	um let's talk a little bit more about the user interface
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0148357_0148770	so do you suggest we use titanium instead of rubber
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0113733_0114557	if you make a remote control out of rubber it's lost in your home for the lost remote control
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0100360_0100754	well you you make it black as well by pressing the black button
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0161537_0162139	um it can be used for uh yeah the remote control can be used for a lot of things
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0162457_0163200	um you said that you want the channel button to be uh a little bit closer to the menu button
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0164156_0164342	so that would be a good way to go
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0062754_0063187	uh a one uh a small button on top of the speech uh recognition
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0207042_0207490	because maybe you have the l. c. d. in here and this is your remote
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0197849_0197953	oh no
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0084583_0084859	it's the real reaction that we're going to use
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0103844_0104007	um
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0113083_0113198	that's a good point
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0034797_0035557	the smartboard smartboard is a little bit of a gimmick and the l. c. d. screen is just an extra gimmick
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0036393_0036896	so that we would be able to implement this feature which is very useful
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0211725_0211875	my name is
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0030102_0030533	uh they are less familiar with uh speech recognition technology
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0022728_0023525	and what i found out from the industrial designer is that the target audience wants a spongy remote control
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0183389_0183981	that would be nice to have a channel button or something that's very easy to use
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0146887_0147517	we could make one with a with a curve to fit in the hand and uh just one without the curve
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0152494_0153151	um i drew a simple drawing of our target customer uh interested in fruit and vegetables
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0097125_0097927	uh first of all i think it's important to see that we have to take into account the user interface design
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0182349_0183117	but that's a problem if you have the l. c. d. display and the numbers
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0041998_0042227	uh black and white the grey colour
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0003093_0003346	oh indeed i did
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0198945_0199055	that's a two
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0157966_0158071	okay
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0190736_0191632	so you should be able to draw your favourite animal pretty much by pressing a button or something
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0073271_0073416	so um
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0044222_0044365	okay going to the menu now
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0041809_0041998	more people will buy it
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0151065_0151305	so that might not be a good solution but
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0173854_0173980	um you mean
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0069546_0070161	so um a little bit of a m uh it's a compromise
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0086677_0087326	and the l. c. d. screen uh should be a bit more expensive because it's a new feature and we want to sell it
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0071824_0072571	um all the buttons are uh made of rubber or um titanium or some other material
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0154060_0154699	and a double curved case or a triple curved case or a double curved case and a multi colour design of the remote control
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0171349_0171495	so people can give feedback
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0065977_0066608	so the number uh on top of the l. c. d. screen is uh volume up and down
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0104423_0105196	yeah you could lose the l. c. d. screen and the um the remote control would be a lot cheaper
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0101010_0101706	well i personally don't like the idea of a remote control that you have to pick up all the time
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0188024_0188151	okay that's the feel
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0189358_0189993	so i think it's not really a good thing that we lost the l. c. d. screen though because they're kinda cool
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0025510_0026239	um the financial aspect was important as it had a huge impact on our design
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0213892_0214034	yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0113138_0113402	even i don't have any more information on that
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0158525_0158749	up down and the teletext button
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0223394_0224233	okay i'm going to try to find out if you're still working on the speech recognition feature or something like that
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0216188_0216423	let's move on
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0056736_0057079	so uh yellow and black are used a lot
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0165095_0165355	for the last twelve euros and a half
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0076041_0076585	um the um the pen is a little uh on top of course
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0139061_0139305	to read all the emails
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0148901_0149184	well i wouldn't buy a titanium one
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0026897_0027839	um the advantage of this is that it has um has a very low production cost
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0181698_0181813	that's not what we're gonna do
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0115913_0116369	if they would pay more for speech recognition and if they would pay more for l. c. d. screen
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0131552_0131947	are there are there's no way we can do the l. c. d. display because it's too expensive
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0084859_0085347	it doesn't tell us anything uh about the production cost
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0049088_0049675	um taking a remote control for example to uh to evaluate the design
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0118532_0118810	and that would also go with the l. c. d. screen i guess
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0199055_0199194	so that's uh
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0006409_0006622	and also trend watching
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0158125_0158229	we'll go with that
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0147646_0147798	plastic cover
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0068609_0069546	um and uh the channel selection um we could have a button for channel selection in the in the l. c. d. screen
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0200196_0200428	colourful yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0073538_0074043	uh this is a s uh a simple design with a double r. c. p.
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0208803_0209030	maybe just stick to a round shape or something
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0212281_0212509	and then the battery is down here
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0092009_0092432	so that brings us down to the budget of twelve and a half
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0074043_0074312	um we can put it on top of it
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0106811_0107293	so i believe one is uh a better design than two
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0108077_0108773	and they don't really like uh i mean they don't like the idea of speech recognition
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0223007_0223394	let's see what we have
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0014852_0015611	so let's see if you think this is the best way of doing it or maybe there's something else we missed out
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0021224_0021610	we decided on a single curved remote control
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0070975_0071219	um yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0204692_0204831	yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0043309_0043495	thank you
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0055076_0055904	so um uh a special colour and a special shape like the l. c. d. screen or something like that
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0155007_0155622	oh just for the extra information it would have been nice
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0051241_0051584	so um finance
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0214673_0214919	and the product should not be over rated too
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0198362_0198503	yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0014661_0014791	maybe
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0011051_0011182	everything's fine
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0002126_0002271	okay
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0117392_0117667	it would actually good to design a logo
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0197400_0197849	so um you want to put a logo on it right
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0030533_0031093	and especially if we are targeting a specific age group that's pretty small
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0029830_0030102	uh the older people prefer dark colours
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0198688_0199153	do you have the l. c. d. on it or that's up there
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0157846_0157967	just now just the logo
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0098483_0098778	okay
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0002271_0002425	goes out a lot
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0123063_0123744	um the last one is a little bit more advanced as you can see um with the l. c. d. display and voice recognition
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0109369_0110186	um you can find your remote control in basic uh functions
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0143794_0144768	maybe you can come up with a list of all the functions that are available on this remote control and what they can do
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0114265_0114438	yeah sure
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0159722_0160048	what do we want to implement in this design
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0173572_0173789	the function is the main one
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0185192_0185365	uh maybe we have to but
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0204286_0204620	changing the uh the channels or uh
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0132127_0132465	okay that's a fancy one
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0014137_0014661	um there are some changes in the components cost anyway
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0087418_0088026	and uh the last point is a speech recognition which is pretty new to the market
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0064328_0064965	um uh the shape of our remote control can be uh
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0018191_0018300	still on top of that
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0210636_0210838	that's the curve
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0188973_0189358	so it's from the smartboard or something
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0056340_0056736	um yeah and um overall uh user friendliness
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0119311_0119924	um yeah this is what you could do with the power supply here but let's see
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0037901_0038470	so you could make a standard remote control with the l. c. d. and the speech recognition in it
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0148893_0149830	for example you can create a menu with all the options which you want on your l. c. d. display
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0058127_0059078	um you can make a remote control with uh with the l. c. d. screen and um you can lose it somewhere in your home
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0115058_0115235	oh sorry um it's up here
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0213175_0213421	just for left handed users that's in the design
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0034045_0034226	in the room
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0134908_0135723	um there's there's a lot of options as you can see but let's just remove the numbers
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0009383_0009600	and we're closing then
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0182131_0182236	um
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0018027_0018191	so here
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0064965_0065167	so um
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0214034_0214463	um the buttons on top of it um yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0181982_0182100	okay
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0158050_0158416	and the the colour of the of the thing itself doesn't change
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0168681_0169252	the l. c. d. is a new feature but it will be used only in the menu
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0193623_0193828	okay
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0168075_0168721	yeah that would be good if we could use the l. c. d. but i'm not sure if that would be feasible
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0195876_0196040	do you see the um
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0163200_0164156	so i think that's a little bit of a problem if you're going to use rubber 'cause the whole remote control is actually made out of rubber anyway
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0165067_0165324	for uh for the yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0083687_0084583	uh the final design should be a classic uh classic remote control with a fancy look and a fancy feel
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0008215_0008404	uh the first options
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0055904_0056247	let's uh let's uh make a decision on that
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0011480_0012177	um the last thing i did was a little talk
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0116827_0117229	so if we were to include the speech recognition in our product
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0207652_0208185	it's almost like you have to move all the buttons a little bit more because it's on top of our logo
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0094960_0095318	um first
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0102499_0103267	and i think we should aim for the younger market which is um could be anything between twelve and forty
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0156264_0156539	so we can just pretty much do whatever we want
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0090706_0091523	and the l. c. d. screen would be uh really expensive to make but it should be a nice addition to the to the remote control
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0171151_0171349	but you have extra buttons
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0145959_0146145	black and grey or black and yellow
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0157441_0157677	it has to be possible to sell it
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0100075_0100370	and how exactly did the colours and the shape change
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0008621_0009142	uh we have to come up with a decision on the total cost of this remote control
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0201670_0201850	oh the colour right
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0104066_0104374	yeah but for the for the logo uh a little bit of extra
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0157677_0157912	or just only to learn it
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0041314_0041809	the look and feel would be uh a more important issue
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0119924_0120250	so they don't really mean that it's expensive we don't know
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0207905_0208061	yeah so there
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0180861_0181069	now it's not very high tech i think
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0088026_0088725	but it's not really the display we want to put in the display because we lost the l. c. d. display
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0184589_0184712	yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0193828_0194709	so maybe the curve is just a gimmick to keep the product uh cool in the in the market
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0191855_0192274	and i think the double curved is a little bit of a curve
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0047969_0048534	so that's uh what i want to uh
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0003346_0003602	um let's see
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0184179_0184486	it's just uh you use your thumb
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0172236_0172417	so um yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0126889_0127431	because l. c. d. seems to be uh quite expensive at the moment
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0128372_0129126	if we don't have a lot of extra functions it's not worth to use the l. c. d. display
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0156932_0157318	um but it has to be the form of the
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0220854_0221642	so um the l. c. d. display will be on top of it i suppose
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0086341_0086677	uh push buttons can be used for both the channels and the volume
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0184460_0184589	yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0150237_0150867	the one with the fruit would be a nice way to make it a little bit more appealing for the young people
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0017532_0018012	so let's say we take the l. c. d. screen and um
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0203461_0203581	so it's your go to
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0225026_0225240	uh we can save this one and then
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0039085_0039958	so the remote control will display a different colour depending on the l. c. d. screen
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0096165_0096908	my personal preference is uh a high end product with a high price
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0085424_0086153	uh as a last step i would like to say that we could uh have a basic uh remote control at a price of twelve and a half
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0147798_0148153	we're the more ambitious on the l. c. d. side
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0161144_0161381	is there enough space for a logo or something
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0010221_0010747	um the production cost is uh supposed to be under twelve and a half
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0082321_0082829	in which case you just uh like an advanced chip on print a regular chip on print
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0002837_0003093	you hold it in your master class
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0218081_0218575	it's important that the remote control is in a good condition because uh
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0218575_0218819	okay so take out the special colour of the r. c.
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0156412_0156537	like you buy one yes
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0214360_0214498	yeah still here
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0208901_0209288	so that's just gonna stay there i think
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0109241_0109369	and as you also said
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0015844_0016334	and we take out the double curved case and uh go to a single curved case
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0105864_0106811	uh it's a little bit more expensive but uh i'm just uh one of the designers who want to make a small remote control
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0205563_0206339	so that's just a little bit higher than the budget you had in here
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0062107_0062754	about uh something about the speech recognition uh thing to make it a little bit spongy on top
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0175068_0175292	um then you get
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0013769_0013987	and we are going to use titanium material
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0163183_0163295	yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0170713_0170940	it could also be made of a special colour
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0016511_0017402	so let's just see what we have done so far without the l. c. d. screen and without the speech recognition
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0099261_0099667	but it's not very good a lot of people are not used to speech recognition
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0043495_0043736	changing covers and everything
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0226653_0226788	it's more straight forward
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0138617_0138850	but there will be a lot of colours on it
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0219527_0220198	so you are going to design the user interface in this one and the industrial designer in that one
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0066722_0067499	um the main buttons are for channel selection and uh volume and uh on and off button
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0113402_0113632	so i have to make the final report as soon as possible
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0023685_0024088	the basic design would be
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0215121_0215344	but it might be a little bit more expensive
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0167860_0167985	um well that could
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0020397_0020995	going to the finance department um i'm gonna uh get a report on the last year's budget
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0184712_0184961	just a little thing to keep the l. c. d. in mind
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0198503_0198945	um we can make it uh
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0145395_0145574	yeah that's a good idea
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0076721_0077038	uh so you can see uh you can use your l. c. d. screen
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0155622_0156003	so do you just take out the l. c. d. display and replace it with an l. c. d. screen
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0206838_0207060	um i don't know but it's
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0096908_0097011	um so
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0152388_0152555	changing covers anyway
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0224233_0224361	and then you make the l. c. d.
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0215759_0215951	supplement
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0107399_0108077	uh well i think people like uh especially young people tend to like it
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0133009_0133455	and then we go to the production cost
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0216954_0217512	we've got the user interface concept which is made out of the current design
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0097992_0098273	we could use the basic black and yellow
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0187176_0187445	so i would draw the colour too
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0035557_0036270	the this would be an issue with the with the l. c. d. display because of the numbers
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0024088_0024509	um okay there are some extra features on this
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0081438_0081673	about the components design
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0160901_0161144	the on off button
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0118947_0119165	but it's a pretty high budget
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0117667_0118175	that would be a better option than uh i think it should be implemented in the remote
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0125507_0125757	so you just don't use it when you don't want it
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0140079_0140497	uh is it possible to make a um a curve in the case
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0159180_0159369	that's okay
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0204831_0204961	that's a good one
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0043097_0043203	that would be all that
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0131947_0132100	so it's got to be a double r. c.
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0164342_0164900	um let's just make one of the buttons a little bit bigger because i'm used to the menu
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0143413_0143544	yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0088970_0089554	um the advanced chip is okay for the speech recognition
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0050725_0050931	um
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0131353_0131484	take the rubber thing out
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0026239_0026776	which is more important than the financial aspect but less important than user interface design
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0115361_0115594	um we also have
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0143544_0143794	that's a very good thing i think
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0153341_0154060	well the multi coloured ones are just a little bit more flashy that's true
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0187144_0187404	um yeah it's just um
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0124348_0125054	okay i think we need one of the advanced options for the l. c. d. display and the speech recognition as well
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0167654_0167860	the volume control
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0205460_0205644	oh
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0072571_0073271	um well the um the people uh want a spongy remote control
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0116369_0116827	or you could take out a double r. here and that would be nice
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0098273_0098436	uh a hand dynamo
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0218891_0219286	the l. c. d. is the user interface system
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0134119_0134652	uh well if we go for the banana one it's a nice choice
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0145796_0145959	so and then you can make a logo on it
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0183117_0183262	think i found the issue
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0217512_0218081	so now we have to look at the financial part and make a final decision
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0141783_0141896	change the case
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0100516_0100747	you use it and it works
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0224778_0225026	maybe this will
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0125054_0125507	especially if it's just an extra option to change the l. c. d. screen or something
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0146246_0146670	we could lose the double curved to have it in the l. c. d.
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0137139_0137803	well i think it's the most important feature of the remote control actually
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0127431_0127946	and i don't think it's a good idea to lose the l. c. d. thing anyway
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0186691_0186832	yeah
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0077038_0077404	um yeah the curve
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0099113_0099261	uh solar cells
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0007708_0008215	um the first of all you should um
AMI_TS3003c_H01_MTD011UID_0172417_0172825	let's have a look at the menu uh for me
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0004211_0004450	and our final loss is three
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0066433_0066604	colourful
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0204416_0204530	is it s technical
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0100114_0100440	and the plastic is not really a new colour
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0242384_0242889	yeah i think we can lose the l. c. d. screen anyway
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0232648_0232759	we do
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0104040_0104203	it's a big a big change
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0161584_0161756	feel like a spongy
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0206702_0206819	but did it work
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0164998_0165536	if it's if our customers are willing to pay extra for l. c. d. screen
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0003551_0003665	that's a triple r. c. s
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0073789_0074535	but that's alright with the rest of the design i think
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0220688_0220894	uh yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0076774_0076876	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0078253_0078439	we could we could make an l. c. d. screen
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0247833_0248137	exactly i think plastic is
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0177373_0177514	oh i had the remote control
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0225853_0226438	and then you can make it with the l. c. d. screen and yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0147297_0147426	there's not much information for this
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0063497_0063747	so it's a good design for the l. c. d.
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0166741_0167260	well i had a little more information this time because it's the last meeting of the day
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0185657_0185820	uh in the colour of the skin
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0150380_0150789	and it's uh it's a little thing extra i think
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0172308_0172577	that's a bit of a trick
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0074539_0074689	only the l. c. d. display i guess
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0195915_0196020	okay
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0003665_0004211	um let's see
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0028364_0028914	but i think the colour thing is uh quite a big issue there actually
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0013106_0013608	then we'll evaluate the product according to the user requirements
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0108779_0109349	the one with the l. c. d. display has to be more expensive than the rest of the remote controls
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0153754_0153939	uh they are yes
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0045420_0046093	if we if you see something like that i don't know if we can implement it in our speech recognition
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0218865_0219036	yes maybe it's
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0235536_0235728	what was it
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0221144_0221348	so you can yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0059766_0060016	well i think that's better than two curves actually
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0168714_0169001	is the design a simple one or a fancy one
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0210551_0210773	the the design is pretty basic just a yellow banana
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0051892_0052253	but then the black is the button colour
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0018533_0019006	there's a one there's a two on the l. c. d. display
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0156703_0156972	that was the point of it i think
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0111584_0111738	just make it really small
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0047771_0047964	so there's not much more to it
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0131840_0132737	uh maybe you can make a uh a basic remote control with uh the shape of a banana or something like that
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0187904_0188353	we had a lot of trouble with the l. c. d. display though
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0134149_0134440	okay and make the score out of it
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0047159_0047280	okay
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0242558_0242728	but
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0076079_0076247	maybe we should dump the speech recognition
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0238789_0239421	you can change the menu by changing your channel or by changing the volume
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0067814_0068508	so uh so you got just a few buttons to scroll through
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0011128_0011851	well we have to decide on a bit of everything if it's possible within our uh budget
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0047280_0047569	that's a two or a three
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0176928_0177045	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0143629_0144030	uh this was a bit difficult but i think it's pretty hard to learn
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0250942_0251380	let's see the problem of the simple design
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0121515_0121659	and those two buttons are standard
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0032014_0032295	so we could count that one as a good
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0106263_0106706	well if you have to stay here for a couple of seconds
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0219865_0219973	uh that's new
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0236226_0236421	if we get an extra product on this
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0116703_0116970	let's make it a little bit bigger
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0010847_0011128	then we'll look at the finance
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0133154_0133380	so it's a bit uh
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0213811_0214110	for a little more uh speech recognition
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0119389_0119627	then yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0211792_0211923	oh
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0090976_0091606	or we can take out the l. c. d. screen and replace it with a normal push button one
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0152829_0152952	that's right
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0256144_0256292	so the project manager
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0197969_0198284	did you make the three d. model first
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0151805_0151906	only fifteen buttons
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0014313_0014458	but um first
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0047569_0047771	we need the advanced chip
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0054504_0054640	see you in a minute
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0213286_0213663	so you have to round it off a little bit
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0204985_0205092	antennas inside
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0010431_0010847	then we can sell uh our product at twenty five euros
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0093381_0093674	well again changing colours
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0016318_0016630	the top of the banana for example
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0155734_0156017	um the project process
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0202182_0202434	yeah but there was no function in the remote control
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0230837_0231027	because i think
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0060170_0060336	but um
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0197629_0197803	thank you
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0070564_0070849	but i think this is rubber anyway for instance
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0106239_0106387	think that's the least of your problem
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0046788_0046989	we can just uh we can do that
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0201997_0202171	because it's the final product
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0162360_0162741	uh a little bit of research is very important here
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0075541_0075679	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0025260_0025597	so uh the speech uh thing is
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0160310_0160865	okay so um the l. c. d. display is definitely a selling point on our remote control
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0170105_0170392	um is the design user friendly
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0044103_0044313	and i can tell you
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0050894_0051207	then we have the sample sensor and the microphone
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0063982_0064253	oh let's see
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0218606_0218760	yeah you can erase this information
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0137000_0137171	rubber making is a very good idea
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0134440_0134932	you have a fancy design and then you have a standard uh remote control
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0079161_0079432	maybe i can start with my own menu instead of yours
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0144030_0144412	the bottom of the remote control we'll have to find out
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0059459_0059638	so there's one other thing
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0054498_0054741	see you come up with a
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0145959_0146152	there will be a real reaction to this product
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0026919_0027039	okay
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0123433_0123820	if you press the channel button you can go up and down with the volume control
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0161756_0161905	innovative
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0025597_0026145	yeah and uh on top of that uh the speech uh speech recognition in your t. v.
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0245777_0246188	well we can put this in the l. c. d. display
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0098534_0099412	but it would definitely be a double curve
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0050630_0050771	we have to take this out i think
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0229667_0229875	or any more ideas
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0130623_0130801	you make a remote with a double r. c.
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0048445_0048674	yeah we have the single curve here
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0095856_0096061	and you drop the whole thing and it makes a noise right
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0042160_0042326	so they don't care
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0103711_0104097	yeah but i think that's that's a bit of an issue there
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0127873_0128246	and we can lose the l. c. d. thing if we want to
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0061647_0061922	just uh an extra feature
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0127616_0127873	so we go to twelve and a half
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0125200_0125742	and that would make the l. c. d. uh more useful on the on the outside
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0054741_0055171	now that will be a little more easy
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0067733_0067938	yeah it's a c yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0034258_0034430	we discussed that already
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0077108_0077625	but we can't do this on a one because you don't have an l. c. d.
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0171025_0171189	seven
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0092797_0093082	we have this on the front and we have that on the
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0139381_0139563	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0035660_0035796	well you can't
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0098258_0098523	the idea that would be nice to look into i think
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0044514_0045184	so that we're pretty much up to date in terms of what our target group has to have
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0146799_0147297	for example if you have a little more space for colours and l. c. d. menus
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0177235_0177373	it was
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0030312_0030651	and well it's an option but the l. c. d. is not
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0194299_0194531	so i think that's a pretty nice idea
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0148713_0149057	we can't we can't lose it at the same time
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0187038_0187139	so there will be that
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0149480_0149709	maybe that's relevant for the l. c. d. screen
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0002070_0002219	oh
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0232098_0232225	but in the working design
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0174943_0175151	do we have too many decisions
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0005801_0006236	we'll discuss this in more detail during our meeting
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0103751_0103896	so that's
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0016914_0017143	then there's the l. c. d. display channel selection
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0196833_0197091	that's the beginning of the project evaluation
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0124160_0124291	if you do the same for the menu
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0230035_0230187	about the product or
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0252939_0253373	okay uh let's just put it in there and see what happens
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0234146_0234459	uh i can think of something that you can add
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0037127_0037580	just make it just make it a little harder to draw if you're not the most creative
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0164617_0164998	and a great product
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0067462_0067814	but i don't know if if it's not too expensive
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0019665_0020108	so it's a pretty straight forward remote control
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0184632_0184738	well we have the logo there
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0162741_0162952	uh is it functional
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0168408_0168623	oh
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0100879_0101028	yeah let's have the spongy
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0163317_0163740	and those are those are the functions that are used all the time
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0177905_0178276	there's not very little extra information about the costs
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0021629_0022526	um you just told us that it's pretty much up to your design and then the user interface designer takes over
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0165903_0166081	so we're ready to sell it by the end of the day
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0169037_0169151	oh i think it's fantastic
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0017832_0018459	uh you have to put the l. c. d. screen on the on the side of the remote control
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0002917_0003189	okay
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0136803_0137008	but then again i think
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0076329_0076577	that's an option
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0092604_0092797	um let's see
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0068502_0068755	yeah i think they take the menu command
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0167947_0168409	so it's better to draw it on the on the drawing board i guess
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0185246_0185657	and they want a product that fits in their living room
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0123125_0123299	and just um
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0051551_0051892	so that's not so much of a deal actually
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0109635_0109761	only five buttons out of ten
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0203638_0203833	and just to be added extra information
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0256701_0256986	yeah maybe we have to have a little more information on that
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0084979_0085308	but maybe it's a little bit too expensive for the time
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0072110_0072807	well i think it's a little too expensive to do the l. c. d. display and the speech recognition
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0156462_0156642	and the evaluation of the
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0030827_0031305	you do you need the normal buttons and the l. c. d. display
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0042859_0043583	we have to make the final design and then sell it at twelve and a half euros
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0038338_0038707	yeah it's not the right double r. double r. triple r.
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0237812_0238244	the only problem maybe it would be better for the whole remote control
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0161347_0161584	um is the remote feel
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0199853_0199991	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0036278_0036567	that's a standard option yeah or teletext
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0031435_0032014	the push button remote control will be made of rubber and the display will be made of titanium
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0182391_0182495	will give the fruit a
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0012264_0012897	so if we sell it for twenty five then we have the twelve and a half euro profit
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0188610_0188785	let's see if this is under twelve and a half
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0233184_0233323	that's a good point
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0024092_0024492	uh you can use the numbers uh to move around the board
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0249784_0249996	that's the only way i guess
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0239421_0239648	that's one thing you can change
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0135087_0135349	there's a reason i think this is a one
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0038452_0038595	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0249669_0249784	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0178513_0178770	uh the production price of the product is twelve and a half
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0193462_0193734	the price is twenty five
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0054091_0054498	so we have the fancy look and feel but now we don't have the cost
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0154964_0155070	let's see
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0013608_0013797	we've got fifteen minutes
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0170912_0171025	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0150789_0151461	but let's see if there's enough space for the l. c. d. screen and everything else
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0046513_0046624	is it rechargeable
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0055171_0055282	enter your name
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0039939_0040252	and uh yeah we don't need an uh a logo on it
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0146322_0146482	to get this to sell
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0112798_0113097	but the l. c. d. display is optional to us
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0089083_0089571	so you can uh take a l. c. d. battery with it
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0062510_0062891	okay well just one thing i wanted to bring up is maybe we should drop the l. c. d. display
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0064253_0064373	if you make this
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0028033_0028364	uh just the buttons for channel selection
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0184352_0184632	is the corporate colour is the corporate image
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0048184_0048445	let's see to the end
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0242985_0243121	the power button
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0008095_0008951	uh this is the detailed design phase um we will uh develop a design of the look and feel
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0096599_0096800	scroll wheel and the push button
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0183036_0183172	go i think it went too far
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0052309_0053124	so maybe we should take a closer look at the remote control to see what it's supposed to do
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0038453_0038660	it's not a banana channel
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0239648_0240492	okay so you can uh pretty much use the whole remote control for programming your favourite channels or something
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0222551_0222719	making decisions on this
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0046275_0046449	but maybe we can use another one
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0041860_0042160	with a with a different colour on the end
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0127182_0127540	slippery
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0039654_0039801	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0084537_0084716	the smartboard will make a sound
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0093430_0093535	uh greasing together
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0105892_0106058	so but the speaker at the top
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0087547_0087698	we have to make a one
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0235728_0236002	five minutes to finish
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0238796_0239004	especially for younger people
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0112275_0112622	and we can keep our l. c. d. display which is expected in our product
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0147616_0147830	so we're gonna have to do a little more digging into that
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0097748_0097915	so you don't need a button
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0170443_0170561	um
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0036435_0036581	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0056221_0056363	okay hi in the closing
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0245141_0245441	then we have some special colours
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0156473_0156654	evaluation criteria
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0107692_0108376	but i don't think there's a lot of people who would pay extra for an l. c. d. screen on a remote control or not
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0254638_0255073	okay i'm going to finish my presentation tonight
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0042516_0042770	okay
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0157309_0157416	there we are
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0099412_0099634	and we need a battery
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0041216_0041353	uh so
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0101088_0101291	okay
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0170437_0170685	very
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0087126_0087445	there it is
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0138886_0139061	um which i believe are the user requirements
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0149761_0149882	that's a good one
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0122725_0123125	we could talk about both wood and rubber
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0041453_0041860	for the menu structure we chose just the buttons and the menus
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0216688_0217321	or uh uh in the shape of a fruit or a r. c. d.
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0019412_0019547	and the colour of the logo
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0072807_0073166	oh they think it's trendy
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0128498_0128621	so that's a five
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0057837_0058157	that's one of the l. c. d. screens
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0106163_0106420	but if you take the push buttons then it's a two
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0137087_0137451	all these new ideas which are just come up
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0138097_0138255	uh just go back to the drawing board
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0092155_0092604	and we have seven and a half
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0133891_0134149	it's just really easy to fill in the numbers
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0176988_0177147	we have done that one before
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0010136_0010431	we will have the prototype presentation first
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0059955_0060170	uh it's just one button
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0075542_0075799	so it's not taking up too much of the price
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0141234_0141583	well it has to be a beautiful design of course
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0171691_0172030	shouldn't be too slow
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0181412_0181585	to a total of two
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0180749_0180961	we have to drop the l. c. d.
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0209665_0209854	are there too many or
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0170510_0170929	still talking about the l. c. d. screen or speech recognition
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0041294_0041399	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0222160_0222383	and we have enough resources for that
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0210912_0211061	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0106964_0107498	uh okay the l. c. d. screen could just be like a scroll wheel that you could scroll through
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0117002_0117143	well it's a plastic cover
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0082453_0083439	maybe it's better to put the l. c. d. display in a more expensive part of the remote control or just leave it on the basic model
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0015791_0016318	well this is my take on what a remote control looks like
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0002296_0002471	let's do that now
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0020108_0020509	and uh let's see what we have to stick to the twelve and a half euro
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0139563_0139867	but i think then we can come back to the l. c. d. screen
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0181518_0182034	actually a little bit of extra information about the product which is not already on the website
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0095217_0095416	um scroll wheel
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0174438_0174714	um do we have all the functional components in that list
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0101291_0101674	and we can save a file as a d. v. c. r.
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0024492_0025251	um the buttons you can use them for uh well um channel up and channel down
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0037009_0037127	that's what i noticed about it
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0187547_0187762	also because the costs are still a little bit high
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0061278_0061447	uh yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0012941_0013106	let's see that will be a bit slow
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0114266_0114455	oh yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0021375_0021603	just uh paint on your own stuff
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0090720_0090859	now remote
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0071360_0072110	maybe it's better to have it in the same place as the l. c. d. screen so that it's easy to use
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0217452_0217617	so yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0029738_0029857	if you look at it
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0219973_0220141	yeah pen and paper is okay
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0078998_0079213	yeah i'm not sure about that one
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0205510_0205664	leadership
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0084758_0084993	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0055958_0056074	yeah with the top of it
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0215998_0216302	uh it's easy to use uh with the speech recognition
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0091895_0092155	okay then we stick with ten buttons
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0214235_0214403	well i think plastic is false
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0176983_0177301	and ease of use
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0036137_0036278	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0244031_0244644	oh the end of the meeting i have something on
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0233005_0233184	double click on it
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0179974_0180138	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0136204_0136368	what do you think
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0060512_0060809	so uh a one a two or a three
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0130525_0130706	yeah and you can
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0231500_0231842	that we're going to lose the l. c. d.
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0027039_0028033	um yeah i think it's uh well we had a lot of time in the last meeting to complete this project
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0033476_0034076	uh you can buy one uh with a banana on it or uh yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0087708_0088326	and uh yeah a c a colour and uh
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0157416_0157698	if you can evaluate
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0147923_0148245	but the other side of the remote control uh no that's true
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0168331_0168504	so
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0061440_0061761	yeah but that's not in this spreadsheet
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0225098_0225564	so uh just uh like you uh the idea of a l. c. d.
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0095416_0095856	if you select the l. c. d. menu you will see the screen on your remote
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0067056_0067164	yes
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0240492_0240596	just as a test
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0236002_0236226	well i think we'll
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0180917_0181412	oh i think it's too too too small
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0191332_0191499	so that would make it a one
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0091753_0091862	it's a close one
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0106891_0107180	one a one a bit uh wrong
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0153182_0153385	yeah i don't know
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0071170_0071360	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0208923_0209034	that's the special colour
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0019006_0019210	at a total of four buttons
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0222026_0222160	that's nice
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0145362_0145959	but this is not really for the market because you're looking for a
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0195745_0195915	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0188192_0188302	we got the curve already
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0115761_0115936	uh it would be a p
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0209363_0209665	did we have the most time for the decision making process
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0103324_0103643	uh yeah we have to stick to the special colour of the r. c.
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0171189_0171295	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0155185_0155519	we still have twelve and a half euros left so we don't sell it
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0078439_0078909	but maybe the remote control would be a little more durable
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0203274_0203420	usually yellow or orange
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0106899_0107035	that's not really that bad
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0039712_0039870	just to uh realise it yourself
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0083439_0083715	especially since we have limited space though
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0175287_0175410	so it's a thing uh
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0100679_0101041	if you use an l. c. d. menu you want to use the l. c. d. display
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0225682_0225853	so everyone's supposed to agree on it
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0236631_0236796	possibly in a different colour
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0161905_0162137	what new features are there
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0133430_0133891	there's a there's a little more room in the market i think
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0219371_0219673	so uh the speech recognition was a huge issue
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0036581_0036775	so it's basically a rubber
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0053124_0053846	we have to go with the twelve and a half because that's the total we will be able to afford
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0244396_0244498	uh i believe
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0098570_0098725	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0175844_0175990	um and do we oh
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0104376_0104780	can we can use the l. c. d. display and the speech recognition together
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0236796_0236996	people don't like fruit in their p. c.
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0101994_0102510	there's another one we can eliminate
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0235657_0235767	five and a half
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0094314_0094454	then you will
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0085521_0085913	if you lose the l. c. d. display
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0199341_0199442	in the design phase
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0202394_0202519	yeah the rubber
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0014580_0015059	we'll do the prototype presentation later
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0112092_0112275	let's see it's got a small l. c. d. screen
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0017279_0017651	plastic is spongy in my opinion
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0037877_0038300	so you have the same thing but it's a bit different on the on the bottom side
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0183365_0183543	then we have to drop the l. c. d.
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0186250_0186526	so i think it's really a nice product
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0255148_0255515	yeah you have to make sure it's not lost in the house
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0189978_0190159	then you know the final design
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0145138_0145487	it's pretty much the same thing as a little bit of yellow on it
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0238244_0238405	so maybe we should just remove the curve
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0034841_0035336	so uh put the pen back in and uh just uh draw a bit
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0076670_0076864	something
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0167419_0167947	yeah that's a problem because i have to fill this in later
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0197803_0197969	project process
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0065854_0066283	it looks a bit like uh
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0096800_0097289	okay but then you can put uh some extra buttons there
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0125980_0126440	so we make one for the men and one for the women
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0087771_0087876	but then
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0157698_0157938	go on
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0226629_0226773	so it's uh
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0068738_0069393	but you can't uh oh not all the buttons are on the same uh
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0201636_0201997	oh no
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0070476_0070612	but but i think that no
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0164162_0164617	is it the remote control we're making for the l. c. d.
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0212384_0212719	smartboard smartboards
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0156026_0156394	so um i'd say let's take out the l. c. d. screen
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0240596_0240780	see you at eight o'clock
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0030651_0030827	you can't draw that one
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0177776_0177905	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0218219_0218571	can you uh can you look at the l. c. d. screen
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0017651_0017832	uh we have a button for that
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0185820_0186250	and we have the remote control for the l. c. d.
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0086475_0086769	but you can uh
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0234586_0235053	so i think that's pretty much the best way to go about it because it should be simple
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0209950_0210414	well the the just the black and white on the on the spongy part
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0056577_0056973	uh can we take out the l. c. d. and the speech recognition
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0057092_0057577	um branding is uh a part of our new product name
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0104980_0105892	okay it's pretty much the same thing as the last time you just take out the top two buttons and replace it with a triple r. s triple r. s triple r. s triple r. s triple r. s triple r.
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0192588_0192723	orange instead of red
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0174271_0174438	is the design functional
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0138928_0139228	how much do we save on the l. c. d. and speech recognition
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0093820_0094017	but how would a scroll wheel work
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0051288_0051551	it's a new chip we need one
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0015059_0015536	so some some of it's from somewhere else yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0213663_0213862	or something else
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0072386_0072531	that's a that's a big deal
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0189335_0189567	there are sixty six functions on our l. c. d. screen
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0016630_0016914	the mute button does that
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0129190_0129350	and make it small or rubber
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0243200_0243641	okay we still have one more thing to find out i think
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0039817_0039922	just for extra reading
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0179851_0180014	think that's a fair price
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0034076_0034258	but yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0063046_0063189	that's possible but let's see
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0190699_0190964	oh it's a funny one
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0005570_0005801	okay this is our last meeting
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0137707_0137976	we have to calculate that
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0155070_0155185	can i stick it on there
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0201139_0201327	sebastian
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0007073_0007473	and then we're going to lose the special colour of the product
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0162952_0163317	are there not more than uh twenty five euros for a remote control
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0147566_0147692	but i think no
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0061761_0062582	but maybe we can make one with the l. c. d. display and a normal button in the middle for example
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0128575_0129190	if we lose the curve then we lose all the good points which you could have picked out
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0073167_0073589	we can lose the l. c. d. display if we want to stay under twelve and a half
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0257455_0257867	and then i think you make a total of at least one and a half
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0179881_0180054	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0128359_0128484	that's that's better
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0176676_0176833	looking at it and getting it
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0139867_0140423	just add a speech recognition to our l. c. d. screen
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0183543_0183656	it's a
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0103078_0103221	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0192857_0193134	just put the l. c. d. on top here i guess
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0180097_0180496	but i think it's a nice idea to round off the numbers
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0006236_0007073	well the only problem with the design is that we don't have the budget to add the l. c. d. screen
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0188962_0189100	are going to work on the l. c. d.
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0146718_0146881	but um
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0153998_0154163	now
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0245441_0245777	can some of us can have some extra information on it
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0256421_0256688	are we going to spend extra money on the l. c. d.
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0132737_0133154	just uh you have to drop the special colour for the buttons or something
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0136474_0136803	well i still think we should go for the simple chip though
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0188530_0188806	ten ten and a half euro
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0232568_0233023	we're going to make a design that's completely out of this world
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0190245_0190356	uh my name is
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0202986_0203157	and i would like to go further with that
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0100440_0100541	has to be advanced
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0069893_0070476	but i think we can just cancel this one because we have the buttons and everything
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0058157_0058347	then we have i think it's done good work
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0208114_0208687	that's just too bad you don't have a special colour for the l. c. d. display
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0088438_0088709	but uh with the oh no
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0026233_0026456	okay
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0142386_0142553	so this is a scroll
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0036894_0037009	so think
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0216302_0216688	so you can uh put it in the l. c. d. screen and see uh
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0086308_0086824	so you can take the l. c. d. screen
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0075679_0075858	exactly
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0154128_0154590	but we can go with the with the l. c. d. display
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0258363_0258676	my laptop is still broken so i'll find out later
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0112622_0112798	how to use the scroll wheel
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0158406_0158595	oh no we've got five minutes left
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0032295_0033198	because one of the things is that we don't want to lose any more buttons than necessary because it's not really a big deal
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0144694_0144852	okay we could make a big deal out of it
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0022694_0023520	um it's just a normal uh remote control the the the the the shape is okay
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0148554_0148713	that's right
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0069279_0069434	yeah on the here
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0170685_0170912	supplement buttons
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0206916_0207281	so you all have to use the black and yellow
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0160970_0161347	which would increase the price to twelve and a half
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0060809_0061278	but there are some more expensive uh elements in it
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0002765_0002891	stick it on straight away
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0196020_0196171	so a little bit of the evaluation
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0233323_0233942	maybe it's better to have the logo on the back of the remote control because the back doesn't look so bad
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0213865_0214034	for the l. c. d. screen
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0217729_0218117	uh you said the menu button is not a real option
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0085913_0086188	and if you use less buttons
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0083822_0084216	yeah but we still have to talk about the two euro fifty
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0173037_0173279	so i would say four
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0040356_0041216	we do have the l. c. d. display but we don't use it so much because uh you have to um yeah lose a little bit of the money
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0148690_0148848	so maybe it's a
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0129520_0130493	so the bottom one is the channel button and the top one is the volume button because you have to scroll down through all the channels
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0138490_0138782	stay on top of each new project every time
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0019210_0019412	but for the sample sensor
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0131332_0131599	to discuss this one for a couple of minutes
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0011851_0012264	because the more money you have the more things are going to cost and the more things are going to sell
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0244644_0244766	five minutes more
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0153385_0153583	the entire cover is orange and yellow
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0069429_0069825	uh you got a button for the channel selection
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0201327_0201462	was it a real challenge for the
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0158226_0158339	more than fifty
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0210871_0211227	it has to do with the l. c. d. on it
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0236421_0236631	innovative
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0088932_0089083	uh advanced option
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0013797_0014313	so we'll have to fill it in a second
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0074986_0075402	which is in the design which is in the design of the spongy cover
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0252721_0252875	uh maybe i'll draw it myself
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0140423_0141234	so if we're going for the simple push buttons it will be a little bit more expensive because of the l. c. d. screen
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0119725_0120301	one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0179499_0179698	does the device give good feedback to the user
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0113870_0114054	if you read the l. c. d.
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0104203_0104445	but um it's
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0035930_0036107	the next meeting will be at twelve o'clock
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0096146_0096447	that would put the scroll wheel on top of the l. c. d. screen
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0215007_0215998	but if you want to make a more uh like uh a presentation of this idea um with the l. c. d. screen
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0030000_0030312	those are more common buttons that most of the time
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0152952_0153182	well i would buy it by the way
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0029107_0029558	even if we are not really limited by the l. c. d. display though
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0043583_0044103	so if it's possible which is very unlikely to do what we want to do
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0243778_0243907	uh didn't get a message
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0046449_0046571	uh i don't know if it's possible
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0119110_0119389	let's see something
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0218259_0218463	yeah but i think you can
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0097381_0097608	you could just scroll down for a number
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0084565_0084675	is it possible to
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0229875_0230035	about the project requirements
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0217264_0217573	yeah i put it in the folder to look at the first time
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0152730_0152944	but you're not stuck
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0221256_0221553	yeah a pen yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0063208_0063402	that would cut the cost a lot
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0238517_0238789	just put it on the remote control itself
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0255238_0255994	now you will be the project manager and take a big part in this thing
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0042530_0042672	um that's about it
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0079853_0080323	can we uh can we make a button on your remote control
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0076864_0077108	plastic no problem
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0008951_0009616	the evaluation we will use the detailed design phase to do that
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0173214_0173379	yeah but
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0184583_0184737	yes it is
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0205664_0206292	what was the goal of creating a remote control and how does it fulfill its purpose
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0094817_0094956	oh maybe you can
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0034430_0034841	but uh that's not a problem we don't need all the extra things
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0023626_0024092	you can put a menu uh in it uh under the yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0176201_0176676	take out the fruit and vegetables uh from the basic remote control
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0145232_0145362	it's pretty handy though
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0240780_0240960	that's a good idea i think
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0199522_0199792	so a little information about our company
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0149057_0149480	all black all black
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0058928_0059435	um you can choose between the titanium and the rubber i think it's a one or a two
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0157938_0158406	of course i gave you the five minutes that we talked about
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0089624_0089850	but i think it's a little difficult
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0237812_0237923	you can do more
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0151436_0151580	maybe it could be too much but
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0218463_0218606	should be possible
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0123989_0124160	so that would still be two batteries
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0091765_0091992	that's that's
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0102611_0102942	yeah if you want to make a little bit of curve just
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0106706_0107015	eighty eight and a half
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0009616_0010053	um we have to do that in the end of this discussion
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0235206_0235536	do you think we're gonna give the l. c. d. a two or a one
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0205333_0205510	okay
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0240919_0241758	yeah but then it would be a problem with the l. c. d. menu uh where you have to write your name or something
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0058479_0058604	yeah wouldn't
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0007473_0008027	so you'll have to spend more money on the l. c. d. screen
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0200381_0200484	oh
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0152156_0152341	but it's uh very special no
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0124384_0124704	that's a really good idea i think
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0198676_0199145	should we have a think of the l. c. d. uh thing first then
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0135571_0136204	what's a little bit of extra for the cover design i suppose
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0033873_0034008	long time
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0048674_0049330	uh we can choose between the single curve or the double curve and that's the same thing
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0046093_0046275	two and a quarter is out of budget
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0149952_0150380	so i have a little more information
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0096574_0096836	grabble grabble spongy control
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0172030_0172181	is the design easy to use
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0082155_0082340	well the smartboard is missing
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0113317_0113870	and it's good for the image of our company
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0157564_0157736	thank you
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0152495_0152752	it would buy
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0077625_0078335	and then we lose the l. c. d. screen which is uh a big deal in today's market
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0128278_0128384	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0237264_0237626	yeah i mean if we stick to a simple design maybe we can lose the curve
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0097811_0098288	so if you take a standard remote control and turn it around so that it's on the other side
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0242163_0242325	even if there are curves in it
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0182037_0182151	yeah true
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0131765_0131884	okay we're not finished
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0137451_0137601	but since it's
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0257026_0257455	and i think you'll get the real reaction on it
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0226438_0226629	that's better
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0148245_0148690	but uh there's a lot of like uh channels that you can uh choose for instance
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0003189_0003551	that's a problem at least this time
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0085527_0085761	it will be a pretty big one
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0191635_0191834	forty minutes one and a half
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0188913_0189159	we're gonna give up on the l. c. d.
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0084216_0084758	we don't have a lot of buttons in the menu
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0171295_0171763	so we've got twenty five euros on our total budget
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0002471_0002765	so i'm a little late again
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0020734_0021337	um let's see what the costs are if we can afford this amount of money on the production
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0056416_0056577	uh standard
AMI_TS3003d_H01_MTD011UID_0172971_0173113	for all the people i like yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0169452_0169635	we'll go for seven
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0104986_0105181	if you try to press it five times
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0097669_0097773	yeah
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0058567_0058729	financi finance
AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0173279_0173431	for twenty five
