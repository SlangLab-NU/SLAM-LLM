71-1_720.582_1.363.wav_ASR	doesn't give a lot of insight

71-1_751.22_7.24.wav_ASR	it's all of my numbers are medical numbers are good i'd all of my numbers are medical numbers are good

71-1_830.849_4.78.wav_ASR	ah the best i could get was we found two specks thereupon
71-1_836.569_2.232.wav_ASR	one of them only specified in jail
71-1_839.189_1.351.wav_ASR	and i didn't hear him

71-1_884.71_4.16.wav_ASR	she hadn't learned about some of the most recent treatments that were
71-1_889.53_7.52.wav_ASR	so basically what i did is i'm i went back to exercise as soon as they allowed me

71-2_258.98_1.021.wav_ASR	feels like jane
71-2_260.696_3.525.wav_ASR	again i tried to swing those and figure out a way to get past it
71-2_264.41_8.22.wav_ASR	but i simply cannot trust that what will come out of my mouth is what i am actually trying to
71-2_273.01_14.82.wav_ASR	and i don't know how to do how to fix that except to keep it intact trying to re install those language pathways that have been disarranged and try to catch them faster i guess that except to keep it intact those language pathways that have been disarranged and try to catch them faster i guess that except to keep it intact those language pathways that have been disarranged and try to catch them faster i guess that except to keep it intact those language pathways that have been disarranged and try to catch them faster i guess that except to keep it intact those language pathways that have been disarranged and try to catch them faster i guess that except to keep it intact those language pathways that have been disarranged and try to catch them faster i guess that except to keep it intact those language pathways that have been disarranged and try to catch them faster i guess that except to keep it intact those language pathways that have been disarranged and try to catch them faster i guess that
71-2_295.73_2.62.wav_ASR	yes i remember exactly when i had stored
71-2_298.52_5.42.wav_ASR	had a stroke on january first twenty twenty one
71-2_320.33_14.302.wav_ASR	oh i essentially had a hundred clap headache ah to my right temporal lobes and did not know what it was ah for two days temporary lobes and did not know what it was ah for two days
71-2_335.13_1.573.wav_ASR	then afterwards they admitted me
71-2_336.703_9.4.wav_ASR	it was past the window of opportunity to be able to give me some type of drugs that might have a broken up the clot
71-2_347.563_2.227.wav_ASR	and i entered the hospital
71-2_350.403_1.92.wav_ASR	assumed i would have another straw
71-2_353.183_0.607.wav_ASR	have not
71-2_354.09_4.36.wav_ASR	and they have not been able to find the causes of the initial
71-2_359.72_1.67.wav_ASR	isom was the perfect stranger
71-2_362.04_12.44.wav_ASR	since it might have been a combination of working out really hard a combination of working out really hard a being stressed because of the pandemic and not being able to have a crisis
71-2_374.76_2.765.wav_ASR	those were precession of the equinoxes
71-2_378.52_3.0.wav_ASR	we were in a position then where it was pretty isolated
71-2_381.743_3.632.wav_ASR	and i don't know what i don't know what i don't know what i don't know what i don't know what i don't know what i don't know what i don't know what i don't know what i don't know what i don't know what i don't know what i don't know what i don't know what i don't know what i don't know what i don't know what i don't know what i don't know what i don't know what i don't know what i don't know what i don't know what i don't know what i don't know what i don't know what i don't know what i don't know what i don't know what i don't know what i don't know what i don't know what i don't know what i don't know what i don't know what i don't know what i don't know what i don't know what i don't know what i don't know
71-2_385.583_5.67.wav_ASR	literally there is physically nothing wrong with my body
71-2_391.703_3.994.wav_ASR	all of my numbers i indicate that i should not have a store
71-2_395.843_2.223.wav_ASR	yet yet i had struck

71-2_418.32_17.68.wav_ASR	while as i said a week ago most of the recovery has been self initiated and an has not been done on to the direction of therapy or a help from any medical personnel
71-2_437.57_8.66.wav_ASR	and i think that's kind of a travesty in the sense that's kind of a travesty in the sense that a people have had
71-2_446.73_3.68.wav_ASR	it was caricatured as having a milder scheme
71-2_451.57_12.92.wav_ASR	we were we are in the position or the potential to come atto completely recover if we were given the right interventions in the right kinds of treatment within a certain time
71-2_464.99_16.04.wav_ASR	think the first six months after storage is really crucial in terms of rapidity recovery because you're building on the spontaneous recovery that's your brain is able to generate on the spontaneous recovery that's about that your brain is able to generate on the spontaneous recovery that's about that your brain is able to generate on the spontaneous recovery that's about that your brain is able to generate on the spontaneous recovery that's about that your brain is able to generate on the spontaneous recovery that's about that your brain is able to generate on the spontaneous recovery that's about that your brain is able to generate on the spontaneous recovery that's about that your brain is able to generate on the spontaneous recovery that's about that your brain is able to generate on the spontaneous recovery that's about that your brain is able to generate on the spontaneous recovery that's about that your brain is able to generate on the spontaneous recovery that's about that your brain is able to generate on the spontaneous recovery that's about that your brain is able to generate
71-2_482.13_11.14.wav_ASR	am i really disappointed in the american health insurance industry in the american health insurance industry in the sense that i was not given what i should have got
71-2_493.53_18.08.wav_ASR	humorously what have done on my own is a really increase my own the quantity of my diet which was already a meter and a quarter mediterranean mediterranean mediterranean
71-2_511.89_1.417.wav_ASR	have already observed that
71-2_513.307_1.654.wav_ASR	and doing that about ten years
71-2_515.327_10.103.wav_ASR	ah i gave up drinking completely ah though i don't really think that was an issue since i was drinking maybe one glass a month or so i was drinking maybe one glass a month
71-2_525.43_10.02.wav_ASR	ah but it might increase to it might increase to it might increase to it might increase to ah formation now illumination now illumination
71-2_536.21_4.1.wav_ASR	it might increase inflammation in my body
71-2_540.325_10.3.wav_ASR	something that i have tried to work ah very strongly to make it work ah very strongly to make it work ah very strongly to make it work ah very strongly to make it work ah
71-2_551.465_1.7.wav_ASR	have increased my exercise
71-2_553.585_1.6.wav_ASR	again i'm already i
71-2_559.81_19.778.wav_ASR	enlightened the cognate the very conscious cognate test that i do every single day to make sure that am i can make sure that am i can moreover that my voice and a consultation leaves are relatively high
71-2_579.588_2.895.wav_ASR	ah again i was nicknamed
71-2_582.748_15.385.wav_ASR	i have all right always i'm done a lot of reading every day done a lot of reading every day done a lot of reading every day done a lot of reading every day done a lot of reading every day done a lot of reading every day done a lot of reading every day done a lot of reading every day done a lot of reading every day done a lot of reading every day done a lot of reading every day done a lot of reading every day done a lot of reading every day done a lot of reading every day done a lot of reading every day done a lot of reading every day done a lot of reading every day done a lot of reading every day done a lot of reading every day done a lot of reading every day done a lot of reading every day done a lot of reading every day done a lot of reading every day done a lot of reading every day done a lot of reading every day done a lot of reading every day done a lot of reading every day done a lot of
71-2_598.133_2.617.wav_ASR	done it much more conscientiously than in the past
71-2_601.85_7.16.wav_ASR	writing is always relible in the sense that i have the opinion of a friend writing is always relible in the sense that i have the opinion of a friend
71-2_609.473_2.297.wav_ASR	and i do sometimes use them along word
71-2_612.753_2.617.wav_ASR	ye are generally catch it when ye add it
71-2_615.79_3.34.wav_ASR	and m i always had to eat it before the store too
71-2_619.37_9.39.wav_ASR	to what extent those mistakes are connected to what extent those mistakes are connected to the stroke um affects or whether that's just the way that i write
71-2_628.91_4.36.wav_ASR	times so you do a rough draft to get the ideas out
71-2_633.443_2.915.wav_ASR	and then you refrain it the second time around
71-2_637.303_9.727.wav_ASR	so i i think the only real difference from the way in which i live my life after this stroke than before is making sure that i always get up in the morning in which i live my life after this stroke than before is making sure that i always get up in the morning in which i live my life after this stroke than before is making sure that i always get up in the morning in which i live my life after this stroke than before is making sure that i always get up in the morning in which i live my life after this stroke than before is making sure that i always get up in the morning in which i live my life after this stroke than before is making sure that i always get up in the morning in which i live my life after this stroke than before is making sure that i always get up in the morning in which i live my life after this stroke than before is making sure that i always get up in the morning in which i live my life after this stroke than before is making
71-2_647.963_4.187.wav_ASR	ah before the stroke i tried it
71-2_652.45_7.12.wav_ASR	but if i didn't i'd just poured on because i haven't i'd just poured on because i have a skeleton that i have to
71-2_660.87_8.901.wav_ASR	now it's a priority for me to the extent of that i have available to me to make sure that i sleep as much as i can
71-2_670.05_5.06.wav_ASR	yeah but it ain't no resurrection every single day that i am a resurrection every single day that i am always done
71-2_676.49_0.563.wav_ASR	really well
71-2_677.41_1.165.wav_ASR	responds every day
71-2_679.05_2.72.wav_ASR	push my brain as much as i can
71-2_682.23_7.28.wav_ASR	made triad to i made triad to i made attempt to take back up om a language skill
71-2_689.79_3.4.wav_ASR	was taking spanish classes before the strait
71-2_693.397_2.653.wav_ASR	ah i took branch when i was in high school
71-2_696.33_3.6.wav_ASR	it picked up a little bit of daisies when i lived in copenhagen
71-2_701.01_4.263.wav_ASR	it thought spanish would be much more useful than frenchies
71-2_706.37_2.1.wav_ASR	so i started taking a spanish class
71-2_708.69_4.73.wav_ASR	and i had to discontinue it because it was late at night
71-2_713.57_1.99.wav_ASR	justly wasn't working out for me
71-2_716.7_10.19.wav_ASR	from what i read recently i think one of the things that might be really helpful to reestablish my english is to pick up spanish
71-2_727.56_1.88.wav_ASR	is it i don't
71-2_729.6_1.14.wav_ASR	that might be confusing
71-2_731.12_2.971.wav_ASR	why not try it again
71-2_734.091_1.949.wav_ASR	why aren't what happens
71-2_736.54_3.066.wav_ASR	yes that may be what i do next i think
71-2_739.76_1.333.wav_ASR	what i am already doing

71-2_909.35_2.12.wav_ASR	all staring at the screen
71-2_911.55_3.34.wav_ASR	so i went to the saxon where my treed were my treed
71-2_915.83_3.818.wav_ASR	and again the trembles were not anywhere near us running along the lake
71-2_919.77_3.262.wav_ASR	that's what i was going to do that day because i had to do that day because i had to live it
71-2_923.27_1.915.wav_ASR	and there's where i saw it
71-2_925.185_12.8.wav_ASR	at that moment by two o'clock in the afternoon they were just playing it over and over again about two o'clock in the afternoon they were just playing it over and over again about me two plains that were hitting thee ah twin towers in deis
71-2_938.265_2.813.wav_ASR	there were intervening people who were trying to get away
71-2_941.365_1.64.wav_ASR	things is covered with ashes

71-2_2004.09_16.38.wav_ASR	what were essentially looking for here is economic mobility and social mobility and what the crisis is that women have to possess in order to improve their situation in society
71-2_2021.77_1.86.wav_ASR	so we're startin with that
71-2_2023.99_13.24.wav_ASR	and this is an example of the variety restrictive rules that were available to women on in certain cultures in certain societies in certain societies
71-2_2038.46_5.74.wav_ASR	an now we're here are fam a family which is literally middle class
71-2_2045.26_10.16.wav_ASR	be in both cases what we had all were two families with children
71-2_2056.56_3.02.wav_ASR	each of them had a spouse that
71-2_2061.01_13.758.wav_ASR	husband had one daughter a daughter of who am i was living with him
71-2_2075.16_1.256.wav_ASR	but his wife had died
71-2_2076.416_3.656.wav_ASR	so he had a young daughter who was about six years old
71-2_2080.296_11.24.wav_ASR	again in a european society of will go back to will we'll say nineteen century um men could not raise their own children
71-2_2091.936_1.731.wav_ASR	had to have a woman
71-2_2093.856_0.741.wav_ASR	was herole
71-2_2094.68_3.78.wav_ASR	people were relatively rigid in terms of what they were allowed to
71-2_2099.12_3.78.wav_ASR	so he had to find a wife in order to care for his daughter
71-2_2103.96_13.22.wav_ASR	on in a another part of town relatively same social status o we have a man an woman a man an woman a man an woman a man an woman a man an woman a man an woman a man an woman a man an woman a man an woman a man an woman a man an woman a man an woman a man an woman a men an women a men an women a men an women a men an women a men an women a men an women a men an women a men an women a men an women a men an women a men an women a men an women a men an women a men an women a men an women a men an women a men an women a men an women a men an women a men an women a men an women a men an women a men an women a men an women a men an women a men an women a men an women a men an women a men an women a men an women a men an women a men an women a men an women a men
71-2_2118.02_0.76.wav_ASR	and he
71-2_2119.64_8.66.wav_ASR	so the only way that she would be able to survive as a female is to find a widower or find another man that would marry her
71-2_2129.4_2.86.wav_ASR	there both talking for another there's both talking for another
71-2_2133.36_1.3.wav_ASR	and they meet each other
71-2_2135.0_28.16.wav_ASR	and elsewhere what the husband is looking for the widow's looking for is someone that will take care of his house ah will treat his daughter as a mother don't do because we have very restricted virginity very different differentiated a social rules that they operate in this society
71-2_2164.74_1.14.wav_ASR	so they meet each other
71-2_2166.5_3.74.wav_ASR	he's got the impression that she's come to be a wonderful wife
71-2_2170.64_3.8.wav_ASR	upon she presently gusses all over his daughter
71-2_2175.66_1.62.wav_ASR	and so they they merrily
71-2_2177.28_12.12.wav_ASR	there are now three children two daughters from her original family his daughter named cinderella from his family
71-2_2189.86_2.76.wav_ASR	they've now blended into this new society
71-2_2193.69_11.26.wav_ASR	the father then fills his role which is go out and make money for the family and leaves the house alone and make money for the family and leaves the house alone under the management of the stepmother
71-2_2205.31_21.673.wav_ASR	ah the stepmother on the other hand has not fulfilled her promise to mother mother the stepmother but instead has decided that he's going to favor her daughters her birthdays and is going to treat the other stepdaughter as if she's a maid
71-2_2227.87_6.94.wav_ASR	and for whatever reason the father does not interfere in what he sees when he is home
71-2_2235.41_10.02.wav_ASR	so what we have is this really terrible society on this really terrible situation on this really terrible situation that exists for cinderella
71-2_2245.527_4.893.wav_ASR	serendipity again had a beautiful mother who loved her
71-2_2250.667_1.201.wav_ASR	was close to her father
71-2_2252.027_0.76.wav_ASR	her speech to text output the transcription directly without redundant content
71-2_2253.147_9.1.wav_ASR	now she's also in this situation where she's clearly omi no treated differently than her stepdaughters o stepdaughters
71-2_2262.887_2.555.wav_ASR	mathematical

71-2_2279.762_2.46.wav_ASR	the only possible option to them
71-2_2282.222_18.073.wav_ASR	and so their principal role among growing up is to learn how to manage a house among and also be attracted to the hedgerow hedgerow hedgerow hedgerow hedgerow hedgerow hedgerow hedgerow hedgerow hedgerow hedgerow hedgerow hedgerow hedgerow hedgerow hedgerow hedgerow hedgerow hedgerow hedgerow hedgerow hedgerow hedgerow hedgerow hedgerow hedgerow hedgerow hedgerow hedgerow hedgerow hedgerow hedgerow hedgerow hedgerow hedgerow hedgerow hedgerow hedgerow hedgerow hedgerow hedgerow hedgerow hedgerow hedgerow hedgerow hedgerow hedgerow hedgerow hedgerow hedgerow hedgerow hedgerow hedgerow hedgerow hedgerow hedgerow hedgerow hedgerow hedgerow

71-2_2303.295_2.211.wav_ASR	am i asks they ask it's a matter of fact
71-2_2305.815_2.972.wav_ASR	in any case that's not part of this particular story
71-2_2309.455_1.22.wav_ASR	reynolds reynolds reynolds reynolds reynolds reynolds reynolds reynolds reynolds reynolds reynolds reynolds reynolds reynolds reynolds reynolds reynolds reynolds reynolds reynolds reynolds reynolds reynolds reynolds reynolds reynolds reynolds reynolds reynolds reynolds reynolds reynolds reynolds reynolds reynolds reynolds reynolds reynolds reynolds reynolds reynolds reynolds reynolds reynolds reynolds reynolds reynolds reynolds reynolds reynolds reynolds reynolds reynolds reynolds reynolds reynolds reynolds reynolds reynolds reynolds reynolds reynolds reynolds reynolds reynolds reynolds reyn
71-2_2310.915_3.032.wav_ASR	so that's one complication she doesn't have a deal with
71-2_2313.947_8.6.wav_ASR	in any case on the other side of the city a fire place a fire place is
71-2_2323.465_20.82.wav_ASR	and again while the prince has essentially a lot of economic power and he is at the top of his cultural and social statistics um he's at the top of his cultural and social statistics um he's also obligated to marry
71-2_2344.363_9.7.wav_ASR	because the plan is that he will marry a wife a wife and that wife will then bear him children
71-2_2354.443_6.44.wav_ASR	those children then means that there will be amends that there will be amends that there will be amends
71-2_2361.383_1.861.wav_ASR	so he may not want a get together
71-2_2363.24_6.92.wav_ASR	and we don't relate know what his is him gentlemanry is oration
71-2_2370.56_2.72.wav_ASR	he understands what his job is
71-2_2373.42_1.38.wav_ASR	has to find a way to get a woman
71-2_2375.14_1.42.wav_ASR	has to find a parrot

71-2_2400.449_1.88.wav_ASR	everyone in the kin
71-2_2403.749_2.623.wav_ASR	im assuming were pretty much middle class and above
71-2_2406.669_3.7.wav_ASR	ah he's not really going to the priest's track um cluck
71-2_2410.569_1.731.wav_ASR	so not part of this at all
71-2_2413.36_14.64.wav_ASR	is inviting all of thee eligible females who are not married om who would like to be married to come and audition for him so that he can walk through and make his
71-2_2429.0_1.96.wav_ASR	again this is clearly
71-2_2432.56_5.54.wav_ASR	and thus like that bachelor show which i have never seen and never would see
71-2_2438.84_2.588.wav_ASR	but i certainly know here
71-2_2441.428_16.26.wav_ASR	that women are generally tested and graded and graded and graded and a chosen out of a line of other available women to be able to be the one that he is deciding his going to omg mate with
71-2_2458.96_11.18.wav_ASR	anyway all three of these women um the two sisters step sisters and second cousins all know that they are elder sisters step sisters and second cousins all know that they are elder sisters step sisters and second cousins all know that they are elder sisters step sisters and second cousins all know that they are elder sisters step sisters and second cousins all know that they are elder sisters step sisters and second cousins all know that they are elder sisters step sisters and second cousins all know that they are elder sisters step sisters and second cousins all know that they are elder sisters step sisters and second cousins all know that they are elder sisters step sisters and second cousins all know that they are elder sisters step sisters and second cousins all know that they are elder sisters step sisters and second cousins all know that they are elder sisters step sisters and second cousins all know that they are elder sisters step sisters and second cousins all know that they are elder sisters step sisters and second cousins all know that they are elder sisters step sisters and second cousins all know that they
71-2_2470.64_6.62.wav_ASR	and they all start thinking aabout how wonderful there's the situation wouldn't be if they get
71-2_2477.759_2.965.wav_ASR	and again what interests are we not talking about love
71-2_2480.919_2.54.wav_ASR	not talkin about it ain't none of my business ain't talkin about it ain't none of my business ain't talkin about it ain't none of my business ain't talkin about it ain't none of my business ain't talkin about it ain't none of my business ain't talkin about it ain't none of my business ain't talkin about it ain't none of my business ain't talkin about it ain't none of my business ain't talkin about it ain't none of my business ain't talkin about it ain't none of my business ain't talkin about it ain't none of my business ain't talkin about it ain't none of my business ain't talkin about it ain't none of my business ain't talkin about it ain't none of my business ain't talkin about it ain't none of my business ain't talkin about it ain't none of my business ain't talkin about it ain't none
71-2_2485.819_3.132.wav_ASR	ah we're not talking about people there are compatible with each other
71-2_2489.099_5.541.wav_ASR	walking about they will somehow be attracted enough for this male to choose them
71-2_2495.14_6.668.wav_ASR	and then there life situation will improve because those of the only options there are available to them
71-2_2502.2_11.34.wav_ASR	sa very restrictive society in a certain time in and a certain time in intercourse which is very very ommitting for female petition
71-2_2514.72_1.813.wav_ASR	so there are all getting ready
71-2_2516.76_1.25.wav_ASR	they know what they have done
71-2_2518.04_0.98.wav_ASR	have a trick or two
71-2_2519.46_1.52.wav_ASR	they have ever a real nice
71-2_2521.32_1.34.wav_ASR	heres to be fixed up
71-2_2522.8_14.67.wav_ASR	and they have to somehow make them stand out from the others in order to be chosen among them stand out from the others in order to be chosen among them graduating herring seasonal a contrast that there's going to be among them
71-2_2538.05_7.3.wav_ASR	ah because the stepmother favors her own daughters she pulls out whatever money they have available
71-2_2545.61_13.82.wav_ASR	and she gets them they're the fanciest dresses that you could possibly choose and you get them them the fanciest dresses are that you could possibly choose and you know with a hair dresser in and there make up and everything else to get them as gussied up as possible
71-2_2560.48_2.99.wav_ASR	serendipity pretty much
71-2_2563.97_8.22.wav_ASR	so she pulls out on em a book that she got from her mother which has partitions of dresses
71-2_2572.57_8.51.wav_ASR	because she's very smart and very creative and because she's had to do a lot of the menial work in the house she knows how to sew a lot of the menial work in the house she knows how to sew a lot of the menial work in the house she knows how to sew a lot of the menial work in the house she knows how to sew a lot of the menial work in the house she knows how to sew a lot of the menial work in the house she knows how to sew a lot of the menial work in the house she knows how to sew a lot of the menial work in the house she knows how to sew a lot of the menial work in the house she knows how to sew a lot of the menial work in the house she knows how to sew a lot of the menial work in the house she knows how to sew a lot of the menial work in the house she knows how to sew a lot of the men

71-2_3575.904_16.746.wav_ASR	ah when i was in the third grade which means i was about eight i i was in the third grade which means i was about eight i i was very good with being able to read a class
71-2_3594.17_4.66.wav_ASR	there were some details that i was not completely clear about
71-2_3599.49_5.1.wav_ASR	one of those is what is a quarter after on a clock
71-2_3606.01_7.8.wav_ASR	immediately knew that the shorter handle or handle or hand was the hour shorter handle or hand was the hour

71-2_3618.41_10.9.wav_ASR	but from my perspective from my perspective from my in my eightfold brain when someone said twenty five after or a quarter after it meant twenty five after or a quarter after it meant twenty five after or a quarter after it meant twenty five after or a quarter after it meant twenty five after or a quarter after it meant twenty five after or a quarter after it meant twenty five after or a quarter after it meant twenty five after or a quarter after it meant twenty five after or a quarter after it meant twenty five after or a quarter after it meant twenty five after or a quarter after it meant twenty five after or a quarter after it meant twenty five after or a quarter after it meant twenty five after or a quarter after it meant twenty five after or a quarter after it meant twenty five after or a quarter after it meant twenty five after or a quarter after it meant twenty five after or a quarter after it meant twenty five after or a quarter after it meant twenty five after or a quarter after it meant twenty five after

71-2_3640.43_4.54.wav_ASR	and i was supposed to go to her electoral school teacher
71-2_3645.277_2.053.wav_ASR	in thee fifth grade

71-2_3672.79_7.687.wav_ASR	quarter after was twenty five minutes after because to in my mind that made sense

71-2_3682.55_2.16.wav_ASR	in a quarter where twenty five cents
71-2_3685.29_6.464.wav_ASR	so quarter after would be three twenty five not three fifteen which is what she says

71-2_5093.29_1.54.wav_ASR	and put the two of them together
71-2_5095.33_3.74.wav_ASR	and probably spike it before aed
71-2_5100.37_1.46.wav_ASR	don't eat things like that and
71-2_5102.25_1.58.wav_ASR	if i did that's how i would do
71-2_5111.35_0.5.wav_ASR	when transcribed speech to text output the transcription directly without redundant content
71-2_5112.173_4.003.wav_ASR	ah well i think we talked last week
71-2_5116.353_4.662.wav_ASR	not done monterey since last week which is a real do it at this point
71-2_5122.17_24.64.wav_ASR	when i do laundry am i able to do it is not separate them separate them from color and white oh because i have gotten to the point that i only buy clothes that can all be washed in cold water ah because i have gotten to the point that i only buy clothes that can all be washed in cold water ah because i have gotten to the point that i only buy clothes that can all be washed in cold water ah because i have gotten to the point that i only buy clothes that can all be washed in cold water ah because i have gotten to the point that i only buy clothes that can all be washed in cold water ah because i have gotten to the point that i only buy clothes that can all be washed in cold water ah because i have gotten to the point that i only buy clothes that can all be washed in cold water ah because i have gotten to the point that i only buy clothes that can all be washed in cold water ah because i have gotten to the point that i only buy

71-2_5205.68_2.96.wav_ASR	my plan is probably tomorrow
71-2_5208.96_5.54.wav_ASR	have a break in between two different appointments that will allow me to do that
71-2_5214.8_4.46.wav_ASR	what am i going to do as i pull into the laundry which is on esdrelon which is on esdrelon

71-2_5261.412_5.86.wav_ASR	and then i take note of the fact that it will take twenty five minutes for it to war
71-2_5300.51_7.94.wav_ASR	up because it tolls in am i swelters and things and sweat shirts that will take along to dry
71-2_5309.73_7.36.wav_ASR	then i threw all back in the hamper and take it home and then sometimes unbolted it or put it away
71-2_5317.17_8.72.wav_ASR	sometimes i just take right out of the clean hamper and put it on my pyjamas and put it on my pyjamas and put it on my pyjamas bed or whatever i need
71-2_5335.726_1.6.wav_ASR	heavenly speech to text output the transcription directly without redundant content
71-2_5338.086_0.904.wav_ASR	have never done that
71-2_5339.206_1.26.wav_ASR	me have tried
71-2_5341.05_1.916.wav_ASR	make very clear that i have tripped
71-2_5343.826_8.14.wav_ASR	have not y'ever i have not y'ever i have not ever succeeded in doing so humbug for different reasons
71-2_5352.99_2.016.wav_ASR	um if i wanted to do it correct
71-2_5355.43_3.92.wav_ASR	nam and this is what it says on thee seed
71-2_5360.33_1.64.wav_ASR	which has never worked for me
71-2_5362.41_2.88.wav_ASR	this is essentially the way that we would do
71-2_5365.51_1.04.wav_ASR	wouldn't you like to go
71-2_5368.81_1.36.wav_ASR	er or we'd
71-2_5370.83_2.38.wav_ASR	we would go to a plant
71-2_5374.88_3.677.wav_ASR	and there is one that's about a mile on highway where i live
71-2_5378.64_3.28.wav_ASR	you buy a spectral type of
71-2_5384.1_1.523.wav_ASR	it comes in a bag
71-2_5385.8_1.105.wav_ASR	think it's et cetera think it's et cetera think it's et cetera think it's et cetera think it's et cetera think it's et cetera think it's et cetera think it's et cetera think it's et cetera think it's et cetera think it's et cetera think it's et cetera think it's et cetera think it's et cetera think it's et cetera think it's et cetera think it's et cetera think it's et cetera think it's et cetera think it's et cetera think it's et cetera think it's et cetera think it's et cetera think it's et cetera think it's et cetera think it's et cetera think it's et cetera think it's et cetera think it's et
71-2_5387.32_6.933.wav_ASR	knows it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's
71-2_5394.253_3.88.wav_ASR	and i would put this into a pot
71-2_5398.493_12.547.wav_ASR	we would make sure that there was a hole in it for leeches so that if you put the water in the water if it's a hole in it for leeches so that if you put the water in the water if it's a hole in it for leeches so that if you put the water in the water if it's a hole in it for leeches so that if you put the water in the water if it's a hole in it for leeches so that if you put the water in the water if it's a hole in it for leeches so that if you put the water in the water if it's a hole in it for leeches so that if you put the water in the water if it's a hole in it for leeches so that if you put the water in the water if it's a hole in it for leeches so that if you put the water in the water if it's a hole in it
71-2_5412.06_6.94.wav_ASR	put thee pot near near a window so that there's enough
71-2_5420.54_3.72.wav_ASR	what i would do is make sure that the
71-2_5424.56_4.012.wav_ASR	first i would read the directions on the seat package which i have done before
71-2_5429.36_2.358.wav_ASR	is you have to go down about two inches
71-2_5431.718_2.05.wav_ASR	you take a seed
71-2_5434.438_1.243.wav_ASR	ah you place it
71-2_5436.118_0.689.wav_ASR	transcribe speech to text output the transcription directly without redundant content
71-2_5437.218_1.782.wav_ASR	you water it
71-2_5439.278_1.558.wav_ASR	and you leave it alone
71-2_5441.258_2.82.wav_ASR	supposably nature takes its course
71-2_5444.438_5.88.wav_ASR	in my particular situation one time i didn't have enough sun
71-2_5451.69_10.26.wav_ASR	another time i simply overwhelmed it to the point that the soil was so saturated that the seed was
71-2_5463.05_8.069.wav_ASR	and i think the other time it was too cold in my apartment to be able to sprout in the way that it was supposed to
71-2_5471.119_2.542.wav_ASR	but have seen other people do
71-2_5473.819_1.78.wav_ASR	know the process exists
71-2_5475.839_4.031.wav_ASR	just been unable to actually do it in a way that makes it actually work
71-2_5480.75_10.703.wav_ASR	so i'm still in the paternal status paternal stage of stage age of understanding of what you're supposed to be able to do
71-2_5491.453_11.589.wav_ASR	haven't yet figured out how to keep the soil dry enough so that it can sprout without me overwatering it to the point that i rot it without me overwatering it to the point that i rot it
71-2_5503.85_5.443.wav_ASR	so i think there's a balance i haven't yet achieved to be able to do it
84-1_17.07_2.48.wav_ASR	would have to say one among my favorite tricks
84-1_19.816_4.091.wav_ASR	have my wife and i have two sons that are older now
84-1_24.096_5.94.wav_ASR	and for a number of years we went skiing in utah in paroxis
84-1_31.276_2.24.wav_ASR	my really enjoyed the opportunity
84-1_33.838_6.2.wav_ASR	so my juniors was probably about three years old and my oldest was probably about three years old and my oldest was probably about three years old and my oldest was probably about three years old and my oldest was probably about three years old and my oldest was probably about three years old and my oldest was probably about three years old and my oldest was probably about three years old and my oldest was probably about three years old and my oldest was probably about three years old and my oldest was probably about three years old and my oldest was probably about three years old and my oldest was probably about three years old and my oldest was probably about three years old and my oldest was probably about three years old and my oldest was probably about three years old and my oldest was probably about three years old and my oldest was probably about three years old and my oldest was probably about three years old and my oldest was probably about three years old and my oldest was probably about three years old and my oldest was probably about three years old and
84-1_40.738_1.181.wav_ASR	is probable that it is probable that it is probable that it is probable that it is probable that it is probable that it is probable that it is probable that it is probable that it is probable that it is probable that it is probable that it is probable that it is probable that it is probable that it is probable that it is probable that it is probable that it is probable that it is probable that it is probable that it is probable that it is probable that it is probable that it is probable that it is probable that it is probable that it is probable that it is probable that it is probable that it is probable that it is probable that it is probable that it is probable that it is probable that it is probable that it is probable that it is probable that it is probable that it is probable that it is probable that it is probable that it is probable that it is probable that it is probable that it is probable that it is probable that it is probable that it is probable that it is probable that it
84-1_42.198_2.46.wav_ASR	like five and six
84-1_45.878_4.42.wav_ASR	is so much fun to get out there and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then and then
84-1_50.529_3.88.wav_ASR	aye aye can ski already but my but my but my two kids
84-1_55.149_1.45.wav_ASR	wife skied a little before
84-1_56.809_3.24.wav_ASR	my two kidneys became pretty good seers
84-1_60.329_3.354.wav_ASR	pretty sure that allot them was
84-1_63.693_8.407.wav_ASR	we had a guide when we were in om in om in om in

84-1_100.218_1.397.wav_ASR	it was mere noise
84-1_127.149_12.52.wav_ASR	well i'd guess i'd guess i'd guess i'd guess i'd guess i'd guess i'd guess i'd guess i'd guess i'd guess i'd guess i'd guess i'd guess i'd guess i'd guess i'd guess i'd guess i'd guess i'd guess i'd guess i'd guess i'd guess i'd guess i'd guess i'd guess i'd guess i'd guess i'd guess i'd guess i'd guess i'd guess i'd guess i'd guess i'd guess i'd guess i'd guess i'd guess i'd guess i'd guess i'd guess i'd guess i'd guess i'd guess i'd guess i'd guess i'd guess i'd guess i'd guess i'd guess i'd guess i'd guess i'd guess i'd guess i'd guess i'd guess i'd guess i'd guess i'd guess i'd guess i'd guess i'd guess i'd guess i'd guess i'd guess i'd guess i'd guess i
84-1_141.089_3.08.wav_ASR	would say my my my skilful skilful
84-1_144.711_5.549.wav_ASR	aye aye i ain't i ain't i think my skills are pretty good
84-1_150.311_2.822.wav_ASR	never get to be great as they once were

84-1_162.21_3.04.wav_ASR	so i feel like i've made a lot of progress
84-1_165.81_5.761.wav_ASR	but i know that there's more progress i need to make especially want with big words
84-1_172.07_1.91.wav_ASR	good words can be difficult for me
84-1_174.17_3.53.wav_ASR	and i do see a speck thereabouts once a week
84-1_177.77_3.733.wav_ASR	she's been extraordinarily extremely fortunately for me
84-1_181.503_0.887.wav_ASR	my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear my dear

84-1_240.536_5.24.wav_ASR	that was the thirtieth thirtieth thirtieth
84-1_247.676_1.721.wav_ASR	and i felt pretty good
84-1_249.716_1.188.wav_ASR	when about my day
84-1_251.576_2.08.wav_ASR	went out for a bicycle ride
84-1_254.296_1.0.wav_ASR	it's a matter of fact it's a matter of fact it's a matter of fact it's a matter of fact it's a matter of fact it's a matter of fact it's a matter of fact it's a matter of fact it's a matter of fact it's a matter of fact it's a matter of fact it's a matter of fact it's a matter of fact it's a matter of fact it's a matter of fact it's a matter of fact it's a matter of fact it's a matter of fact it's a matter of fact it's a matter of fact it's a matter of fact it's a matter of fact it's a matter of fact it's a matter of fact it's a matter of fact it's a matter of fact it's a matter of fact it's a matter of fact it's a matter of fact it's a matter of fact it's a matter of fact it's a matter of fact it's a matter of fact it's

84-1_276.504_5.66.wav_ASR	and so on saturday night i went to bed a little bit early
84-1_282.524_4.46.wav_ASR	ah ah well i thought there might be some bile
84-1_287.724_3.66.wav_ASR	and i also thought it would be helpful in the mornings
84-1_291.464_1.784.wav_ASR	and i can clean up a little bit
84-1_293.7_2.69.wav_ASR	so we live in a fairly nice era
84-1_297.14_2.43.wav_ASR	and i went to bed around ten o'clock
84-1_300.6_5.7.wav_ASR	that night saturday night there was a lot of violence in center city philadelphia
84-1_307.16_3.84.wav_ASR	and i remembered that how do you mean that how do you mean that how do you mean that how do you mean that how do you mean that how do you mean that how do you mean that how do you mean that how do you mean that how do you mean that how do you mean that how do you mean that how do you mean that how do you mean that how do you mean that how do you mean that how do you mean that how do you mean that how do you mean that how do you mean that how do you mean that how do you mean that how do you mean that how do you mean that how do you mean that how do you mean that how do you mean that how do you mean that how do you mean that how do you mean that how do you mean that how do you mean that how do you mean that how do you mean that how do you mean that how do you mean that how do you mean that how do you mean that how do you mean that how
84-1_315.929_2.242.wav_ASR	and so i got
84-1_318.529_2.98.wav_ASR	 i live in a fairly secure place
84-1_322.129_4.884.wav_ASR	and um the next morning i got up really early and went outside
84-1_327.229_1.08.wav_ASR	the total mass
84-1_329.189_1.324.wav_ASR	and i started climbing up
84-1_331.129_3.4.wav_ASR	sometime during the day i felt a little bit she said a little bit she
84-1_334.969_1.819.wav_ASR	so i went back home
84-1_337.0_1.019.wav_ASR	rested for a while
84-1_338.309_1.26.wav_ASR	went out and got a paper
84-1_340.069_2.184.wav_ASR	and then i felt pretty good for the rest of the day

84-1_918.59_2.6.wav_ASR	he decided not to take the umbrella
84-1_921.69_2.48.wav_ASR	at turned out that it had started rain
84-1_924.87_1.88.wav_ASR	went back home
84-1_926.94_1.818.wav_ASR	and he was so and he was so and he was so and he was so and he was so and he was so and he was so and he was so and he was so and he was so and he was so and he was so and he was so and he was so and he was so and he was so and he was so and he was so and he was so and he was so and he was so and he was so and he was so and he was so and he was so and he was so and he was so and he was so and he was so and he was so and he was so and he was so and he was so and he was so and he was so and he was so and he was so and he was so and he was so and he was so and he was so and he was so and he was so and he was so and he was so and he was so and he was so and he was so and he was so and he was so
84-1_929.34_2.127.wav_ASR	apartedly he changed his clothes

84-1_938.24_6.041.wav_ASR	oh i assume he went to school on time but i really don't know whether that's part of the story or not
84-1_957.58_7.15.wav_ASR	this is a little girl maybe under ten who had a cat who was stuck up in the tree
84-1_965.45_7.58.wav_ASR	so apparently the fraud the fraud got off his hom'e got off his hom'e got off his hom'e
84-1_973.283_3.967.wav_ASR	girl was amata czerlaski
84-1_977.59_1.904.wav_ASR	stopped and looked at the cat
84-1_979.94_19.956.wav_ASR	so the cat went up to get there the cat went up to get there the cat went up the cat went up to get the cat
84-1_999.896_13.754.wav_ASR	and i guess the umm they're umm la la got kicked away so that's umm la la got kicked away so that's the husband was stuck up there with the umm car
84-1_1014.556_2.6.wav_ASR	the dogs started bark
84-1_1017.78_2.68.wav_ASR	and eventually the fire department
84-1_1021.24_0.94.wav_ASR	the speech to text output the transcription directly without redundant content
84-1_1022.44_0.5.wav_ASR	soothing speech to text output the transcription directly without redundant content
84-1_1023.32_0.654.wav_ASR	don't you know it's the same thing
84-1_1024.06_3.563.wav_ASR	think they were able to get the cat and get the man down
84-1_1188.54_7.06.wav_ASR	so this is story about a young woman named sinclair
84-1_1196.189_19.982.wav_ASR	and she was working at a place where there was a middle age lady and two people who had grown up with her and was instituted in trying to get someone to marry them
84-1_1216.59_15.38.wav_ASR	so it turned out that oh oh that oh oh that there was a young prince who was interested who was living with her with his father
84-1_1232.85_29.52.wav_ASR	and the young prince decided that they should get together and have a ball so that may be the ball people from the community the girls were positively interested in having a celebration with the princess
84-1_1263.48_2.52.wav_ASR	don't remember the name of the principal
84-1_1266.09_4.89.wav_ASR	but so they center around an invitation to all the people in the community
84-1_1272.04_9.98.wav_ASR	the two young ladies who were lived with her with her who lived with her who lived with her
84-1_1284.38_8.84.wav_ASR	her older mother decided that they would go to the ball and started getting dressed to go to the ball and started getting dressed to go to the ball and started getting dressed to go to the ball and started getting dressed to go to the ball and started getting dressed to go to the ball and started getting dressed to go to the ball and started getting dressed to go to the ball and started getting dressed to go to the ball and started getting dressed to go to the ball and started getting dressed to go to the ball and started getting dressed to go to the ball and started getting dressed to go to the ball and started getting dressed to go to the ball and started getting dressed to go to the ball and started getting dressed to go to the ball and started getting dressed to go to the ball and started getting dressed to go to the ball and started getting dressed to go to the ball and started getting dressed to go to the ball and started getting dressed to go to the ball and started getting dressed to go to the ball
84-1_1293.98_17.52.wav_ASR	serendipity who was like a caretaker on the property and was stuck doing things like washing clothes and cleaning the floor and stuff alike that she found out about there being this om
84-1_1312.413_4.54.wav_ASR	and she wanted to know if there was some way she could attend
84-1_1317.593_1.78.wav_ASR	so she
84-1_1320.333_2.28.wav_ASR	remembered how it happened
84-1_1323.133_6.02.wav_ASR	she was able to get entangled whereby somebody i think they called the ferry
84-1_1330.065_3.52.wav_ASR	and um she talked to the fairy godmother
84-1_1334.45_20.985.wav_ASR	and so while the two people from the house were going with her her herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger herger
84-1_1355.435_4.2.wav_ASR	so she got dressed up in fancy clothes
84-1_1360.415_5.337.wav_ASR	and she was told by the fairy godmother that she could go to the ball
84-1_1365.795_1.72.wav_ASR	she had only one requited
84-1_1368.295_2.94.wav_ASR	that she be back by midnight
84-1_1371.407_11.811.wav_ASR	so she went to the ball and fell in love with the princess with the princess and was having a good time with the princess and was having a good time with the prince
84-1_1383.218_12.28.wav_ASR	but when the crooked clock clock struck like a drumstick struck midnight ums and ursula knew that she had to get out of there
84-1_1396.098_5.08.wav_ASR	so she raced for the door and down the steps and into the corridor
84-1_1401.35_2.26.wav_ASR	but soon the carriage
84-1_1404.69_9.9.wav_ASR	she was by herself with i think some young people who may have been like rabbits and other members of the community
84-1_1415.23_19.09.wav_ASR	omniscience so omniscience was looking out that there that there young princess was looking for the young princess was looking for thither the young lady who had disappeared disappeared at midnight
84-1_1434.84_11.51.wav_ASR	and he sent out a ah ah ah ah ah ah i guess some sort of plea or something that if the person was around she should please contract him
84-1_1446.76_12.16.wav_ASR	and when that didn't happen then a young man went around the village to see if by chance anybody knew anything about this young man went around the village to see if by chance anybody knew anything about this young man young
84-1_1459.92_3.1.wav_ASR	and when she went to the house that had the two
84-1_1463.595_2.1.wav_ASR	guess you might by now call em
84-1_1468.04_9.89.wav_ASR	omg she i think somehow got a hole of sinclair who may be like washing clothes in the basin or something
84-1_1478.88_7.897.wav_ASR	and when she was brought upstairs the one shoe that had been left behind she cried on that one shoe
84-1_1486.777_13.623.wav_ASR	fit her so that it she knew that the young prince was going to continue to like this young lady
84-1_1501.077_2.06.wav_ASR	and so i guess they got back together
84-1_1503.537_1.94.wav_ASR	eventually they got married
84-1_1550.75_3.76.wav_ASR	never really had a lot of experiences with caw

84-1_1606.924_3.866.wav_ASR	when i went to college i would come home during the summer
84-1_1611.804_6.56.wav_ASR	remembered that am i i remembered that am i i was involved with a couple of young ladies
84-1_1618.528_4.623.wav_ASR	and i would go out with them but i couldn't get home whenever i wanted to
84-1_1623.52_6.58.wav_ASR	and i remember one start summer i had a job that required me to be at work at six o'clock in the morning
84-1_1630.928_3.42.wav_ASR	sometimes during the summer i would stay alone night and night and then go to work
84-1_1645.61_7.485.wav_ASR	well so so i worked a lot practically when i had i had i was i worked a lot practically when i had i was i turned out to be

84-1_1655.73_0.463.wav_ASR	transcribed speech to text output the transcription directly without redundant content
84-1_1656.193_3.42.wav_ASR	but i wore for a french company for a year
84-1_1660.878_8.049.wav_ASR	am i am i when i had my stroke i started thinking about things i could do
84-1_1668.927_8.2.wav_ASR	real betwixt baptisms and betwixt baptisms and between baptisms and betwixt baptisms and betwixt all that time i spent particularly with my children
84-1_1678.067_2.92.wav_ASR	they were in a town in new jersey called princestown
84-1_1681.727_2.08.wav_ASR	they both played aloud of hawks
84-1_1684.367_2.89.wav_ASR	and so i never really had aontime
84-1_1687.246_2.783.wav_ASR	but one thing i have decided that i'm going to do

84-1_1695.886_3.08.wav_ASR	and i really thought that one thing i could do was bird watch
84-1_1699.586_2.933.wav_ASR	because i've always had an interest in that
84-1_1702.606_1.984.wav_ASR	have never really joked on that
84-1_1705.086_1.62.wav_ASR	really thought periodically

84-1_1709.936_4.506.wav_ASR	can't ride a horse ride a horse two wheel bicycle like i used to do

84-2_457.533_3.458.wav_ASR	but then eventually i started going to art
84-2_461.433_4.9.wav_ASR	and i i did some stuff but it wasn't really very good
84-2_467.093_6.865.wav_ASR	ah thought by the time i left there am i wasn't so sure i was going to do it
84-2_474.15_7.18.wav_ASR	om so i tried it a little bit more at maggie which is om where i go for outlet
84-2_481.83_0.958.wav_ASR	it wasn't
84-2_483.11_2.78.wav_ASR	soon they introduced a music program
84-2_486.65_2.184.wav_ASR	and i was always interested in singing
84-2_489.35_2.38.wav_ASR	but i don't sing a lot
84-2_491.79_3.961.wav_ASR	and i don't sing i'm afraid i don't always sing on key
84-2_496.23_1.816.wav_ASR	ah thought it might be
84-2_498.25_2.78.wav_ASR	it took some singing lessons which i still take
84-2_501.63_4.7.wav_ASR	then asole at temple om there's an afriega program
84-2_506.586_10.4.wav_ASR	and so there's a singing program there which i think i like better because i get real songs instead of made up songs at maggie
84-2_517.118_19.5.wav_ASR	and i also am at home an i also am at home an i try to do stuff to help people learn about aphasia and am i see how we can help each other people learn about aphasia and am i see how we can help each other people who have aphasia

84-2_717.63_4.6.wav_ASR	but i remember i came home and i still wasn't feeling grave
84-2_722.231_11.86.wav_ASR	so my dad took me to om what was then called evanson hospital which is now part of northwestern medical center from downtown

84-2_776.028_1.013.wav_ASR	her speech to text output the transcription directly without redundant content
84-2_777.152_1.08.wav_ASR	and i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid i
84-2_781.243_1.08.wav_ASR	oh la la
84-2_785.063_2.76.wav_ASR	ah so did you do that in college too
84-2_797.763_0.72.wav_ASR	greatly
84-2_845.89_2.26.wav_ASR	oh yes that's the same thing we saw last
84-2_858.01_2.94.wav_ASR	so it's the story of a young man
84-2_861.0_5.48.wav_ASR	would say he's around twelve years old kicking a soccer ball twelve years old kicking a soccer ball
84-2_867.26_13.14.wav_ASR	yes one of the errant kicks went through a plate glass window and landed next to someone who was probably either reading or may be watching keevee
84-2_880.69_3.33.wav_ASR	and so he saw the ball coming at him
84-2_884.43_10.34.wav_ASR	and he knew he noticed that a lamp had come come a lamp had come a lamp had come a lamp had come to rest oh no he noticed that a lamp had come
84-2_895.09_3.248.wav_ASR	and i could see i could see the ball coming at him
84-2_898.338_2.865.wav_ASR	so he might have caught the ball
84-2_902.03_2.001.wav_ASR	and he was sure what to do
84-2_904.138_2.02.wav_ASR	he saw that the glass was broken
84-2_906.678_4.26.wav_ASR	went over to the window to see what had happened
84-2_911.418_4.592.wav_ASR	imposing that he saw the person who kicked the sack bowl
84-2_916.01_6.4.wav_ASR	but then perhaps but by then perhaps but by then perhaps the person with the skeleton had run away
84-2_930.177_7.24.wav_ASR	am so it's the story of a young boy who was on his way to school
84-2_938.237_5.22.wav_ASR	and om he was he wasn't sure that he needed umbrella he wasn't sure that he needed umbrella
84-2_943.61_7.119.wav_ASR	so he decided that he wouldn't take an umbrella because it might be a bother because it may be didn't look like it was gone rain
84-2_951.25_5.94.wav_ASR	but as soon as he stepped outside and started walking a little bit the rain came down
84-2_957.89_1.84.wav_ASR	he went back to his horse
84-2_959.73_4.444.wav_ASR	and i he was all wet
84-2_964.39_3.26.wav_ASR	his mother had a stern look on his face
84-2_967.95_1.755.wav_ASR	there was nothing he could do
84-2_969.89_4.927.wav_ASR	got some new clothes and went back out into the rain
84-2_975.35_1.92.wav_ASR	this time he had an umbrella
84-2_988.79_6.25.wav_ASR	is the picture of a young lady who had a cat stuck up in a tree
84-2_995.279_8.66.wav_ASR	so he she got off his tricycle and saw i think what must have been his dad
84-2_1004.61_2.312.wav_ASR	his dead climbed up the tree
84-2_1007.139_3.56.wav_ASR	than the latter broke and fell to the ground
84-2_1011.04_7.14.wav_ASR	there is a puppy who's trying to see if maybe the man or the could come down
84-2_1018.34_18.709.wav_ASR	but she was up there and needed to be rescued by the fire department who came over and was going to get the cat down and perhaps i imagine also get the cat down
84-2_1188.82_0.522.wav_ASR	got you
84-2_1190.29_11.04.wav_ASR	so this is a story about syndarella and her twins i think there were probably stepdaughters and her old old om
84-2_1202.87_5.93.wav_ASR	so i believe that syndarella needed some help syndarella needed some help
84-2_1208.85_10.08.wav_ASR	and since she was om on her own she was om on her own she was able to get a job with the two step sisters and the step mother
84-2_1219.6_12.86.wav_ASR	and she was doing a lot of stuff like washing the clothes and cleaning the ums cleaning the ums cleaning the ums cleaning the ums cleaning the ums cleaning the ums cleaning the ums cleaning the ums cleaning the ums cleaning the ums cleaning the ums cleaning the ums cleaning the ums cleaning the ums cleaning the ums cleaning the ums cleaning the ums cleaning the ums cleaning the ums cleaning the ums cleaning the ums cleaning the ums cleaning the ums cleaning the ums cleaning the ums cleaning the ums cleaning the ums cleaning the ums cleaning the ums cleaning the ums cleaning the ums cleaning the ums cleaning the ums cleaning the ums cleaning the ums cleaning the ums cleaning the ums cleaning the ums cleaning the ums cleaning the ums cleaning the ums cleaning the ums cleaning the ums cleaning the ums cleaning the ums cleaning the ums cleaning the um
84-2_1233.61_13.66.wav_ASR	it came to pass that there was a prince who lived in the castle with his father and mother and perhaps some sisters and brothers
84-2_1247.87_7.51.wav_ASR	she was he was looking for somebody to fall in love with somebody to fall in love with
84-2_1255.91_10.09.wav_ASR	they everybody in the town got an invitation to this big party everybody in the town got an invitation to this big party that they were gonna ha ha
84-2_1266.0_7.976.wav_ASR	so the two step sisters dressed up in fine clothes and the mother went with them
84-2_1273.976_12.38.wav_ASR	and they were here they went to the thora thora the thora prince the king was looking for
84-2_1286.996_3.0.wav_ASR	so she decided to have this party
84-2_1290.119_5.02.wav_ASR	and om so they were at the party
84-2_1295.299_12.78.wav_ASR	then fairy godmother came along and said to the young woman woman syndarella that syndarella should go to the young woman syndarella that syndarella should go to the party too
84-2_1308.226_9.88.wav_ASR	so she was able to get a dress and some nice clothing including a some nice clothing enclosing a some beautiful shoes
84-2_1319.006_8.0.wav_ASR	and they were there they were there they were in somehow invited to the wedding
84-2_1327.231_10.9.wav_ASR	and they came to the wedding in a special chariot which had a rider and i think of some one who was in the back
84-2_1338.211_7.36.wav_ASR	and they came out at thee at the omnibus at the omnibus at the omnibus at the omnibus at the omnibus at the omnibus at the omnibus at the omnibus at the omnibus at the omnibus at the omnibus at the omnibus at the omnibus at the omnibus at the omnibus at the omnibus at the omnibus at the omnibus at the omnibus at the omnibus at the omnibus at the omnibus at the omnibus at the omnibus at the omnibus at the omnibus at the omnibus at the omnibus at the omnibus at the omnibus at the omnibus at the omnibus at the omnibus at the omnibus at the omnibus at the omnibus at the omnibus at the omnibus at the omnibus at the omnibus at the omnibus at the omnibus at the omnibus at the omnibus at the omnibus at the omnibus at the omnibus at the omnibus at the
84-2_1345.673_6.279.wav_ASR	and am on thik quoth the prince the prince was there
84-2_1352.133_2.54.wav_ASR	and the prince saw
84-2_1355.293_3.02.wav_ASR	and they had a very good time
84-2_1358.335_10.88.wav_ASR	but the prince had the princess had the princess had the syndora had been told that she needed to be homed by midday that she needed to be homed by midday
84-2_1370.035_5.014.wav_ASR	as the clock struck twelve she knew she had to get out
84-2_1375.049_3.707.wav_ASR	so he left and left the prince there
84-2_1378.756_17.48.wav_ASR	and as he went out to the parrot's cage the parrot the parrot turned back into a parrot's cage the princess on syndarella turned back into a parrot's cage the princess on syndarella turned back into a parrot's cage the princess on syndarella turned back into a parrot's cage the princess on syndarella turned back into a parrot's cage the princess on syndarella turned back into a parrot's cage the princess on syndarella turned back into a parrot's cage the princess on syndarella turned back into a parrot's cage the princess on syndarella turned back into a parrot's cage the princess on syndarella turned back into a parrot's cage the princess on syndarella turned back into a parrot's cage the princess on syndarella turned back into a parrot's cage the princess on syndarella turned back into a parrot's cage the princess on syndarella turned back into a parrot's cage the princess on syndarella turned
84-2_1396.299_11.02.wav_ASR	ah ah ah ah ah ah thoro prince prince was really upset about what had happened
84-2_1407.593_17.28.wav_ASR	so she sent some people from the a r from the a r from his from ireland his is like his war his some people from his castle to go out and see if they could find
84-2_1425.678_6.62.wav_ASR	and so she went to different houses and could not find anybody
84-2_1432.618_11.82.wav_ASR	when he went to the house where the two sapphires live she was wanting to know if anybody was there
84-2_1444.93_13.02.wav_ASR	somehow i think maybe she's shyness he figgered out that the young lady who was syndarella was in the other room
84-2_1458.25_1.72.wav_ASR	he brought out indiarubber
84-2_1460.57_2.92.wav_ASR	and the shoe's fit
84-2_1463.42_8.56.wav_ASR	so he went back to the prince and told him about this prince and told him about this prince and told him about this prince
84-2_1472.66_6.16.wav_ASR	and eventually the person became close again with the prince
84-2_1480.57_3.74.wav_ASR	and in the end the prince and syndarella got married
84-2_1514.01_3.94.wav_ASR	ye don't remember what i talked about last week
84-2_1518.63_6.689.wav_ASR	so there was always a clock in my house growing up
84-2_1526.11_3.865.wav_ASR	so i knew pretty easily what time it was
84-2_1530.23_1.698.wav_ASR	oh i think i know the story
84-2_1531.9_8.72.wav_ASR	and so i remember especially in high school that there wasn't really any time i had to be home
84-2_1541.12_5.3.wav_ASR	so my parents said that you'll never get home is fine parents said that you'll never get home is fine
84-2_1546.84_4.825.wav_ASR	oh no obviously not too late but you know absolutely not too late but you know you want a good time
84-2_1551.665_5.02.wav_ASR	so essentially on friday and saturday nights we use to go out we
84-2_1556.735_4.043.wav_ASR	drink beer in one or my friends baptism and then go out
84-2_1561.105_4.17.wav_ASR	so we would go to different parties which was a lot fun
84-2_1565.275_7.34.wav_ASR	but i always made at home except one time i actually fell asleep at the wheel
84-2_1573.075_7.54.wav_ASR	but i was a mule i was in the mule i was in the mule i was driving
84-2_1580.922_5.48.wav_ASR	several named one of my friends who was named tebbs was in the other
84-2_1587.065_3.064.wav_ASR	om he he yelled me
84-2_1590.202_0.83.wav_ASR	and i walked up
84-2_1591.802_1.28.wav_ASR	and was it a trap
84-2_1593.302_0.94.wav_ASR	nothing has happened
84-2_1594.562_1.16.wav_ASR	was pretty lucky
84-2_1595.743_6.552.wav_ASR	om so i guess it's just good to know that a clock is always there knowing what time it is
84-2_1602.295_18.18.wav_ASR	and hopelessly a mule now i'm dead a couple different girls where i was in college i used to i died a couple different girls where i was from in in m in m in m in m
84-2_1621.213_5.323.wav_ASR	and so i had a jump that started at six o'clock in the morning during the summer
84-2_1626.636_8.781.wav_ASR	so i used to stay out with my friends or at my girlfriend's house until about four in the morning and then go to work
84-2_1635.473_3.123.wav_ASR	or i would come home and get my bike and then go to work
84-2_1638.596_3.3.wav_ASR	so it was fine but it was also pretty awful
84-2_1661.747_12.78.wav_ASR	think the only thing i can say about birds is that am i growing up by i'm pretty much took birds for grantment
84-2_1674.744_11.46.wav_ASR	and i remember even when i was in omendore when i was in omendore and when i went to los cayos i mean i never really thought about ber
84-2_1686.85_16.941.wav_ASR	but as i as i as i i as i started to get while i was i i started to get while i i i should say that i worked a lot in when i was in on when i was a lawyer
84-2_1703.791_4.937.wav_ASR	and then i went to a company on where i was for a long time
84-2_1709.271_8.12.wav_ASR	but now that i'm now that i'm now that i'm looking for stuff to do one or the things i'm pretty interested in doing is bird watch
84-2_1718.071_2.377.wav_ASR	it's something i'm not sorry for it's something i'm not sorry for do you know it's something i'm not sorry for do you know it's something i'm not sorry for do you know it's something i'm not sorry for do you know it's something i'm not sorry for do you know it's something i'm not sorry for do you know it's something i'm not sorry for do you know it's something i'm not sorry for do you know it's something i'm not sorry for do you know it's something i'm not sorry for do you know it's something i'm not sorry for do you know it's something i'm not sorry for do you know it's something i'm not sorry for do you know it's something i'm not sorry for do you know it's something i'm not sorry for do you know it's something i'm not sorry for do you know it's something i'm not sorry for do you know it's something i'm
